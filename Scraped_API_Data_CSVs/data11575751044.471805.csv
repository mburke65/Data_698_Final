Ah, but there’s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment — and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs. One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if America adopted a public health care financing system.

So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone? Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.

Indeed, that’s exactly what Biden’s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They “will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost two million jobs,” a Biden campaign official warned recently.

Note the word “kill” in the statement. That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.

Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being. From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the United States and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed. Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.

What caused the American decline? Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.

The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin. In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use. But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care."

“The Sackler name is a problem, whether it’s the Arthur Sackler name, or all the Sackler names,” he said.

Student activists said they were happy with the move. Nicholas Verdini, 24, a first-year medical student who lobbied for the change, ran outside on Thursday to look at the sign as soon as he received an email from Tufts informing him that the names were being removed.

“I was genuinely shocked,” Mr. Verdini said. “It was emotional, not only for the cause, but because I lost my sister to the opioid epidemic, and it felt like a big win for her.”

Two weeks ago, Mr. Verdini addressed Tufts’ board of trustees and told them about his sister, Katelyn Hart, who was 25 when she died of an overdose. He said several trustees approached him afterward, visibly moved by what he had said.

“The response was much greater than I was expecting,” he said. “It can’t be easy for them to go back on a contract, on a commitment that they made in exchange for a large amount of money. It can’t be an easy decision to make, but I think it was the right one.”

The three Sackler brothers — sons of a Brooklyn greengrocer, all of whom became psychiatrists — and their descendants gave lavishly to prestigious universities for decades, including $60 million in the last five years, The Associated Press has reported."

But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.

Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2018 — accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy — compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.

For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence .

The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself."

Hello.

michael barbaro

Hello.

bernie sanders

How are you?

michael barbaro

Senator, Michael Barbaro.

bernie sanders

Nice to see you, Michael.

michael barbaro

Great pleasure.

jessica cheung

Hi, Jessica Cheung.

bernie sanders

Jessica. Nice to see you. Where would you like me?

michael barbaro

Very nice to meet you, Michael Barbaro. So, Senator Sanders, my colleague Alex Burns told me that to understand your political career, and your presidential campaign today, we have to go back to the first time that you won elected office as mayor of Burlington in 1981. So that’s —

bernie sanders

The New York Times got it right. Every once in a while.

michael barbaro

So that’s what I want to ask you about.

bernie sanders

All right, there you go.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Burlington is the largest city in Vermont. Situated as it is on Lake Champlain with the Adirondack Mountains view, it’s a lovely, lovely spot. We’d like you to meet its new mayor. Mayor Sanders got a lot of attention recently, not only with his ten vote victory, but mostly because he is a socialist.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ronald Reagan and his billionaire friends do not represent America, but we do. Lastly, I want to touch upon an issue that dear to my heart, and that is the issue of affordable health care. The people of Burlington voted overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly in support of Congress moving forward to establish a national health care system. I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

bernie sanders

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you. One thing I want to appreciate, being a disabled person, is the little discount we get on our cable TVs, because I think it’s a positive point to have educational programs to be able to watch and fill our minds at periods when we are unable to get out. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me just jump in and remind our viewers. What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

alex burns

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

bernie sanders

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

[music]

michael barbaro

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

michael barbaro

Is parallel.

bernie sanders

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

michael barbaro

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

But a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the nation remains in a period of relatively slow growth in health spending.

Health spending in the United States rose by 4.6 percent to $3.6 trillion in 2018 — accounting for 17.7 percent of the economy — compared to a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2017. Federal officials said the slight acceleration was largely the result of reinstating a tax on health insurers that the Affordable Care Act imposed but Congress had suspended for a year in 2017. Faster growth in medical prices and prescription drug spending were also factors, they said, but comparatively minor.

For decades, national health spending galloped ahead of spending in the overall economy, lowering wages and stressing household budgets. But over the last decade, the pattern has shifted somewhat. Although the country consistently spends more on health care each year than it did the year before, the overall rate of growth has stayed below historical averages. In 2018, health spending grew more slowly than the economy overall, a rare occurrence .

The factors leading to the slowdown are not fully understood. For years, economists thought they were the result of lagging effects of the recession. But as the pattern has continued far into the economic recovery, they increasingly point to changes in the delivery of health care itself."

A cosmopolitan elite is eroding the integrity of America’s borders and the sovereignty of its citizens. This numerically small but economically powerful band of globe-trotters use their outsize political influence to preempt popular policies that they don’t like — or else, sabotage the enforcement of those they can’t block. The resulting lawlessness and illicit cross-border flows beggar middle-class taxpayers and strain the finances of our welfare state. And everyone who dares to object to this state of affairs — or to demand a crackdown on those who flout our nation’s laws and make a mockery of its claims to self-governance — are derided as naïve, know-nothing demagogues or worse.

You’ve heard this story before. Donald Trump and his allies have deployed variations on it to demonize undocumented immigrants, and cast their xenophobic movement as a populist, majoritarian cause whose only real opposition is a cabal of unpatriotic elites. And yet, virtually all of the right’s (non-explicitly white nationalist) complaints about our government’s failure to enact and enforce restrictions on internationally mobile labor ring far truer when applied to internationally mobile capital.

This reality is reflected in the current debate over wealth taxes. Critics of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders’s schemes for soaking the superrich have martialed a variety of arguments against them. But the most prominent is an appeal to fatalism: Even if annual levies on great fortunes or confiscatory top income-tax rates were desirable, the U.S. government would remain incapable of effectively enforcing them. A wide variety of economists and billionaires have offered versions of this warning. “You finally have some politicians who are so extreme that I’d say, ‘No, that’s even beyond,’” Bill Gates recently said, qualifying his support for stiffer taxes on his class. “You do start to create tax-dodging and disincentives, and an incentive to have the income show up in other countries and things.”

This argument asks Americans to accept a stark limitation on their nation’s sovereignty. It stipulates that in a world of globally mobile capital, the effective limit on top tax rates is set by our superrich, not our democratic polity. Why this diminution of the nation-state’s authority should be acceptable — even as a minuscule amount of undocumented immigration is regarded as a crisis of the rule of law — is difficult to explain.

There have been times in American history when immigration restriction was a popular cause. But we’re not living in one. According to Gallup’s most recent polling, only 27 percent of Americans believe that immigration levels should be reduced. By contrast, Elizabeth Warren’s plan to levy a 2 percent wealth tax on households worth over $50 million commands 61 percent approval in Politico-Morning Consult’s polling, with a large plurality of Republicans endorsing the idea. Public support for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 70-percent top marginal tax rate is similarly robust. And yet, such steeply progressive tax policies are widely considered politically untenable and logistically unenforceable — largely because of the outsize political influence (and innovative unlawfulness) of the cosmopolitan elites who bankroll the Republican Party.

The costs of our government’s inability to police every inch of our 1,933-mile border with Mexico — and thus, perfectly enforce our legal restrictions on labor mobility — are miniscule if not nonexistent. Far from burdening middle-class taxpayers and straining the welfare state’s capacity, undocumented immigrants contribute an estimated $13 billion to Social Security and $3 billion to Medicare each year, despite their ineligibility for those programs’ benefits. Meanwhile, America’s undocumented population also increases our nation’s productive capacity, and thus, the size of the economic pie that can be diverted to publicly beneficial ends. These facts, combined with the undocumenteds’ greater propensity for abiding by our nation’s laws, means that the imperfections in our immigration enforcement system have gifted our country a lower crime rate, higher economic growth, and a smaller federal deficit.

By contrast, the costs of Uncle Sam’s failure to enforce existing taxes on the rich (let alone, to enact rates commensurate with popular preferences) have been exorbitant. By the IRS’s estimates, tax evasion costs the federal government roughly $450 billion in lost revenue every year. Much of this is achieved through underreporting, but a good chunk is attributable to the illicit movement of wealth across borders. Globally, upwards of $6 trillion in untaxed earnings are stowed away in tax havens, according to the estimates of economist Gabriel Zucman, a leading authority on the subject.

The one percent’s refusal to abide by our nation’s tax laws is all the more remarkable given how much influence they’ve exercised over their content. For decades, a large majority of the American public has said that taxes on the rich are too low. And yet, policymakers have bucked that consensus, with Republican administrations reducing the tax burdens of the rich by far more than their Democratic successors have increased them. In 1980, America’s wealthiest 400 families paid an average effective tax rate of 47 percent; today, that figure is 23 percent, which is slightly lower than the average rate paid by those in the bottom half of America’s income ladder.

The dollar’s privileged status as the global reserve currency, combined with persistently low interest rates, has mitigated the consequences of our inability to subject the superrich to progressive taxation: Instead of fully offsetting the costs of tax breaks for billionaires with cuts to social spending, Uncle Sam has been free to run higher and higher deficits. But demagogy about the national debt has still forced bouts of austerity and persistent underinvestment in social programs and infrastructure that would benefit ordinary Americans. Meanwhile, in the absence of robust federal funding for various state-level programs, many states have steadily increased taxes on their poor.

In sum: Just about everything conservatives say about immigration policy and enforcement in the U.S. applies with much greater force to tax policy and enforcement. Our inability to hold internationally mobile capitalists accountable to our lenient tax laws undermines one of the most basic aspects of national sovereignty — the freedom to democratically determine our polity’s distribution of economic rights and responsibilities — and does so in a manner that materially harms ordinary Americans.

Happily, a few on the right are beginning to understand this. The latest issue of American Affairs — a policy journal founded by a Trump supporter who wished to add some intellectual sinew to the skeletal frame of the mogul’s nationalist ideology — features an excellent meditation on “Tax Sovereignty in the Age of Global Capital.” In the essay, Michael Cuenco, a graduate student at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, articulates some of the arguments I’ve outlined above, while endorsing a far more sophisticated conception of national sovereignty than one is used to encountering in a conservative publication. Drawing on the work of the political philosopher and economist Peter Dietsch, Cuenco argues that the “Westphalian concept of national sovereignty” — defined by the illegitimacy of one state interfering in another’s internal affairs — has become outmoded in an age of footloose capital:

In an economically interdependent world, the extremes of tax competition and the absence or relative weakness of tax cooperation mean that, as countries “struggle to preserve their Westphalian sovereignty” through strategic attempts at attracting and retaining globally mobile capital, “arbitrage becomes possible and the erosion of [fiscal self-determination through low fiscal flexibility and regressive pressures on public finance] results.” Dietsch proposes that, as things are, “Westphalian sovereignty is no longer adequate, or even logically possible. If the policies of [one state] affect other states in ways that, although not directly exercising authority over their policies, nevertheless indirectly undermine the effectiveness of these policies, then Westphalian sovereignty is compromised.” Furthermore, the continuing rise in capital mobility might necessitate new forms of institutional cooperation between states that could further conflict with the ideal of Westphalian sovereignty.

Dietsch makes a comparison with individual liberty and appeals to “the idea that sovereignty, just as much as liberty, entails not only rights but obligations” … Dietsch is thus able to formulate “tax sovereignty” as having a “twofold conditional nature,” consisting of a state’s right to fiscal self-determination bundled with a “responsibility to respect” the fiscal self‑determination of other states.

In other words: Safeguarding America’s national sovereignty and building effective institutions of global governance are not conflicting objectives; the second is a precondition for the first. In the absence of an international system for monitoring and policing cross-border capital flows, no nation can exercise genuine sovereignty over its own fiscal policy.

Fortunately, constructing such a system is well within our collective capacity. In fact, we’ve already broken ground on the project. As Cuenco notes:

One need look no further than the United States, which is already far ahead in getting other nations to respect its fiscal self-determination. In 2010, the United States unilaterally imposed the Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (fatca) that requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to submit the financial accounts information of American citizens and resident taxpayers to the Internal Revenue Service, with the threat of a 30 percent withholding tax on U.S. source income to be imposed on FFIs that fail to comply. This historic piece of legislation and its global consequences serve as a concrete example of a state demanding that other states recognize its sovereign right to collect revenue from its tax base, albeit in a rather heavy-handed way, by compelling foreign actors to provide assistance to its revenue agency. More could be done to improve fatca, but it’s a start … One can envision a near future where sovereign states are endowed with newfound fiscal capacities and powers of enforcement that would allow them to effectively track and tax the globally mobile segments of their tax base.

America’s power on the world stage may be in decline. But between our coveted consumer and financial markets, and military supremacy, we retain a lot of leverage over how global commerce is conducted. If a Sanders or Warren administration chose to make the restoration of fiscal sovereignty a top-tier priority of its foreign policy, the superrich’s taxable assets would have nowhere to hide (or, at least, fewer places to hide). Some of the logistical challenges of wealth taxation might persist. But the ceiling on how much revenue our government could realistically extract from the tiny fraction of its citizens who’ve been hoarding the gains of economic growth would rise meteorically.

To this point, progressives have largely framed their tax plans as measures for combating inequality and advancing economic justice. And these are surely potent themes. But truly comprehensive tax reform — and the revamped enforcement apparatus it would entail — would also represent a reassertion of the rule of law, and the sovereignty of our nation-state. Trump’s Republican Party, meanwhile, exists to subordinate such sovereignty to the whims of its globe-trotting benefactors. Sanders and Warren might be wise to point that out."

The 2020 Democratic presidential field, which added two candidates (Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg) last month, continued its natural “invisible primary” shrinkage as Montana governor Steve Bullock and former representative Joe Sestak withdrew from the race at the end of the Thanksgiving weekend.

Sestak left the contest as he entered it (very late, in June): as more or less an asterisk. He hoped his anti-Establishment persona and strong national-security record (he reached the rank of rear admiral in the Navy) would give him traction. But he raised very little money (under $400,000 in 2019, as of the third quarter), made no real mark in Iowa or other early states, and never threatened to make any debate stage. He came across as a figure from the past, less because of his two unsuccessful Senate campaigns in Pennsylvania than because of seeming like the relic of an era when Democrats pined incessantly for candidates with a military background.

Bullock, a sitting two-term governor from deep-red Montana with a reasonably progressive record, was a different matter. On paper, he had a strong electability argument in a cycle when Democratic voters were obsessed with electability, and as the presidential field first formed, he had some serious street cred. But he fatally alienated many insiders by refusing to enter the contest until his state’s legislative session ended in May. He missed the first debate in June, then had his one shot at a breakout moment in the July 30 debate in Detroit. As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti explained at the time, expectations for Bullock were high going into that event:

For months now — and, in some cases, years — a handful of senior Democrats have been whispering to donors, activists, strategists, and pundits that they should take a serious look at Montana governor Steve Bullock. Here’s a guy who’s actually won a statewide race deep in Trump Country, an anti-dark-money crusader with a solid liberal record, who could be the non–Joe Biden folksy sorta-centrist voters might be looking for, they said.

Unfortunately, the most memorable Bullock moment in that debate was his argument with Elizabeth Warren about her proposed no-first-use-of-nuclear-weapons position. Appearing determined to keep a preemptive U.S. nuclear strike on the table was not a great look for today’s Democratic Party:

[A]s the evening wound down, his exchange with Warren over nuclear policy highlighted the sheer scale of the task he still has ahead of him. And it reminded his advocates that this world probably isn’t the one of their wistful musings.

And it was John Delaney, not Bullock, who succeeded in hogging attention as the non-Biden-centrist in the race by going after Sanders and Warren repeatedly. That was the last time Bullock appeared in a candidate debate.

He managed to pull in $2.3 million in third-quarter fundraising, enough to run a couple of TV ads in Iowa, the main focus of his campaign. And for his fans there was one thrilling moment when an Emerson poll of that state in October showed him suddenly holding 4 percent of the vote (good for sixth place, ahead of such worthies as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker). But subsequent surveys were deeply discouraging, particularly the gold-standard Selzer poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom in November, which gave Bullock less than one-half of one percent alongside a pallid

24–26 favorability ratio. Whatever Bullock was selling, Iowa caucusgoers weren’t buying it.

One problem Bullock had among the party insiders who were his strongest constituency was the intense desire many harbored that in the end he would emulate John Hickenlooper by dropping out and instead running for the Senate (in his case, against Republican senator Steve Daines). Like Hickenlooper initially, Bullock has long maintained he’s not interested in becoming a senator, as Vox reported in August:

Bullock has repeatedly — and emphatically — said he doesn’t want the job.

Montana’s Senate seat “has never in his life, not once, been a consideration,” Bullock campaign senior adviser Matt McKenna told Vox. “There’s just no way.”

He repeated that demurral as he withdrew from the presidential contest. Buy cynics–or optimists, depending on how you look at it–will point out that Montana’s filing deadline for the Senate race isn’t until next March. Still, it’s more likely that Bullock will quietly end his term as governor next year and consider his options. He’s relatively young at 53. And if Democrats lose to Trump in 2020, Bullock will still be around, still possessing a sterling political record (if you overlook this misfired presidential bid) and his electability argument as his party sorts through the wreckage and looks for salvation."

Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist.

None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.

The emails show how, even at the state and local levels, lobbyists are trying to bend public opinion away from an idea that has seized much of the debate during the current Democratic presidential primary. Two candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), have proposed a massive redesign of the health-care system that would place all Americans on a single government health insurer.

AD

The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.

AD

The revelation comes amid a fierce debate among Democrats nationwide about the best way to address health-care concerns. Health care remains a top issue for many voters, and industry groups and moderate politicians have warned that the ideas pursued by Warren and Sanders could be viewed as too extreme and lead Democrats to lose in the 2020 election. But the ideas are also very popular among many Americans, and the health-care industry has taken notice.

The emails offer a glimpse into the industry mobilization against both single-payer and a “public option,"" a government-run insurer that would compete with private plans. A change could redirect trillions of dollars in spending, with insurers, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies all directly affected.

AD

The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future has spent more than $1 million on television advertisements since August warning against Medicare-for-all and other changes to the health-care system, according to Advertising Analytics, a firm that tracks TV spending. The Partnership has recently expanded its operations to the state level, and has heavily targeted voters in early primary states and battleground states, according to Politico.

AD

Neither of the consultants who helped write the op-eds would confirm or deny whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future.

MacDonald, asked whether he works for the organization, responded over the phone by saying: “Not directly. ... I probably need to talk to some other folks before I provide any details to you and see if I can have somebody call you back.” MacDonald said in a subsequent interview that he could not provide additional information about his clients.

AD

DeLand’s emails to the Ohio lawmaker’s staff include the acronym for the group in the subject line: “PAHCF op-ed - OH - Huffman[3]. docx.” DeLand did not return requests for comment about whether she had been hired by the group.

A spokesman for the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future declined to confirm or deny whether the group had hired MacDonald or DeLand. In emails to reporters, the partnership linked to op-eds written by these state lawmakers, at one point citing them as evidence that “voices throughout the nation” oppose Medicare-for-all.

AD

“It’s no surprise that elected officials on both sides of the aisle, and many other voices throughout the nation, are expressing serious concerns about these one-size-fits-all proposals” such as Medicare-for-all, Lauren Crawford Shaver, the Partnership’s executive director, said in a statement.

AD

Single-payer supporters say the lobbyists’ role in crafting the op-eds bolsters their argument that their opponents are parroting talking points from industry groups that profit off the current health-care system.

“These secret emails blow open what I saw firsthand and revealed as a health insurance whistleblower: These companies and their lobbyists will stoop to whatever it takes, no matter how grotesque, to deny people the lifesaving coverage they need,"" said Wendell Potter, a former health insurance executive who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. “This is just the latest reason we need to reform this broken system where greedy corporations determine who can get medical treatment in America.”

AD

The emails raise troubling ethical implications about the undisclosed involvement of private interests in lawmakers’ public statements, said Larry Noble, who served as general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center and the Federal Election Commission.

AD

“It’s disturbing,” Noble said. “I think there’s a certain ethical obligation to be upfront about who wrote the editorial.”

The emails appear to show extensive outside involvement in the Montana lawmakers’ op-eds. In a Microsoft Word document, MacDonald removed three paragraphs from a draft of Kelker’s op-ed that pointed out that the United States “clearly spends significantly more on health care per capita than other developed nations.” He also deleted a table from the lawmaker’s original draft showing that the United States has higher health-care spending per capita than France, Germany, Norway and Switzerland.

AD

The columns were published this summer in the Missoulian, a newspaper published in Missoula, and the Billings Gazette.

AD

“I know most newspapers are going to have trouble formatting the graphic you provided and will likely ask us to hold off on that,” MacDonald told Kelker in a June 12 email. “The client had trepidations that it might also come across to the ‘less-discerning’ reader that because foreign single-payer markets cost patients less, they are superior.”

Instead, MacDonald wrote in the draft he sent back to Kelker that “extreme ends of the political spectrum"" are offering health-care proposals while “what most Montanans and Americans would prefer lies somewhere in the middle.” In his revisions, MacDonald also added a sentence that said, “Calls for a more government-controlled healthcare system are misguided as well.”

AD

In an interview, Kelker said it is common for state legislators to publish under their name op-eds that they did not write. “That’s pretty normal,"" she said. ""Actually, most of the time, for legislators, at least in Montana, [they] are written by someone else. You know, a helper-person, not necessarily a lobbyist. I normally write all of the text for my op-eds.”

AD

She added: “I suppose I’m fairly naive. … As a legislator, you learn to sort out who is a good guy, and who is not, in terms of the lobbyists, and [MacDonald] has always been really straight. I don’t hang out or do anything with lobbyists much, but I really do trust him.""

Gross, who acknowledged writing less than half of her op-ed, said that when she worked at Planned Parenthood, she frequently provided “templates” for young people who needed help drafting statements, adding that this practice occurs elsewhere, as well. Gross also said she listened to MacDonald’s description of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future and supported the group’s message.

AD

“Formally and informally, I have held the role of community/grassroots organizer for more than a decade. Providing letter-to-the-editor op-ed drafts/templates is a common practice in organizing work,” Gross said in a text message.

Gross also pointed to low pay for Montana lawmakers and noted that they do not have staff members.

She added: ""If I could do it over again, I would have spent more time on it and put it in my own words. But I was up against time constraints. ... If the angle is that a consultant wrote half of the op-ed that I had published in the Billings Gazette in July, so be it. I’m not embarrassed by that at all.”

Andrew Person (D), who served in the Montana state legislature until 2017, said in an interview that MacDonald also sent him a draft of an op-ed in June. The draft, reviewed by the Post, drew on Person’s background as a former aide to former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mt.), who helped write the Affordable Care Act.

Person said he did not think it was unethical for lawmakers to sign their name to an op-ed they did not write, but said: “It’s an important story because the public should be aware ... It has a definite impact on the public perception of the stand elected officials are taking on certain issues, and on certain issues you’re not going to be able to get a paid lobbyist to organize an effort like that.”

Person declined to put his name to the op-ed.

An aide to Ohio state Sen. Huffman confirmed that their office worked with the consultant on Huffman’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all as “socialized medicine” and “not a workable solution.” Asked whether that consultant had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, the aide responded, “I believe so.” Huffman’s office declined additional requests for comment.

John Fortney, a spokesman for the Ohio Senate Majority Caucus, later said in a statement: “The legislative process is open to input from everyone, including experts from [the] medical community. Senator Huffman is an emergency room doctor and understands the serious problems and affordability of the left’s misguided single payer agenda.”

Both Kelker and Gross said they received criticism from constituents about the views expressed in their op-eds. The day after Kelker’s op-ed ran, however, she wrote MacDonald an email that said: “At church, I received many favorable comments — mostly from Republicans!”"

At first glance, Michael Bloomberg’s campaign for the Democratic nomination looked like the answer to a question no one asked.

Perhaps a few Democratic-primary voters were pining for a corporate-friendly centrist who lacked Joe Biden’s appeal to nonwhite people and one-upped his baggage on issues of racial justice, financial regulation, entitlement spending, and sexual harassment. But while this constituency may be large enough to fully staff a “Conscious Capitalism” panel at Davos, it seems far too small to supply the billionaire with a plurality of Democratic delegates.

It’s now clear, however, that Bloomberg is casting a wider net. In a recent interview with PBS — which recirculated on social media on Sunday — the former New York mayor signaled that he intends to run in the “unrepentant Stalinist” lane of the Democratic primary. Asked by Firing Line’s Margaret Hoover about how the U.S. can get China and India to be good partners in the fight against climate change, Bloomberg argued that the Chinese Communist Party was ecologically friendly, democratically accountable, and invulnerable to the threat of revolution.

Bloomberg: China is doing a lot. Yes, they’re still building a lot of coal-fired power plants.

Hoover: And they’re still burning coal.

Bloomberg: Yes, they are, but they’re now moving plants away from the cities. The Communisty Party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public. When the public says I can’t breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator; he has to satisfy his constituents or he’s not going to survive.

Hoover: He’s not a dictator?

Bloomberg: No, he has a constituency to answer to.

Hoover: He doesn’t have a vote. He doesn’t have a democracy. He’s not held accountable by voters.

Bloomberg: If his advisers gave him —

Hoover: Is the check on him just a revolution?

Bloomber﻿g: You’re not going to have a revolution. No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.

Bloomberg’s views here stand in stark contrast to those of Bernie Sanders. Although some centrist pundits have declared the Vermont senator a proto-authoritarian leftist, Sanders’s own rhetoric belies that title. The self-avowed “socialist” has cast Xi’s China as the leader of an “international authoritarian axis,” one that has been “clamping down on domestic political freedom while it aggressively promotes a version of authoritarian capitalism abroad.” Sanders’s broadsides against Chinese communism have led some on the left to decry him as a bourgeois deviationist and imperialist dog. Thus Bloomberg’s apparent aim is to assemble a motley coalition of penthouse-owning executives with a financial interest in appeasing Beijing and basement-dwelling “tankies” with an ideological investment in Xi Jinping Thought.

Okay: Michael Bloomberg is probably not making a conscious play for the “kratom-track” Maoist vote in South Carolina. But it is remarkable how much the patron saint of neoliberal paternalism’s views on China overlap with those of “tankie” Twitter. It’s hard to imagine that a figure like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could have argued that Xi is not a dictator — and that the Chinese Communist Party is accountable to majoritarian opinion — without suffering broad bipartisan condemnation. Yet Bloomberg’s remarks in September prompted few calumnious columns on the authoritarianism of the anti-populist center. Which is unfortunate, since the U.S. business community’s interests in Beijing make this political tendency a genuine threat.

As a substantive matter, Bloomberg does have a small kernel of a point: The Chinese government does not rule by brute force alone, enjoys significant popular support, and has demonstrated a concern with responding to certain forms of public disaffection — including complaints about air quality in the nation’s primary cities. But it is unclear why Bloomberg thinks “They’re now moving [coal] plants away from the cities” qualifies as evidence of China’s commitment to combating climate change. If a coal plant spews C02 in the middle of a forest and no one (with political power) is around to complain about it, it still makes Earth warmer. Even if we accept that Xi is accountable to public opinion, it does not follow that his government will pursue sustainable development. Nations with formal mechanisms of democratic accountability have been almost universally shirking their obligations under the Paris accords. Meanwhile, China’s supposed responsiveness to popular concerns about pollution has coincided with regressive changes in its overall energy policy. Since 2017, Beijing’s annual investment in clean energy has fallen from $76 billion to $29 billion. In the coming years, it plans to add about as much new coal-power capacity as currently exists in the entire European Union.

So Bloomberg’s initial answer is a non sequitur at best, and his subsequent ruminations on the character of Xi’s regime are something worse. In a nation where critical speech is censored (if not criminally punished) and the public is inundated with state propaganda, what does “the will of the majority” mean exactly? And if an authoritarian ruler enjoys the approval of 51 percent of the population, does that mean he cannot be a “dictator,” no matter what he does to disenfranchised minority groups? And if “no government survives without the will of the majority of its people,” does that mean most residents of apartheid South Africa approved the ruling regime right up until the early 1990s, when black opinion in the country suddenly changed?

It may be difficult to discern the logic of Bloomberg’s apologia for Xi. But it’s quite easy to posit a logical reason for Bloomberg to spew illogical apologies for the Communist Party: The billionaire has vast financial interests in China, and those interests have allegedly compromised his civic-minded endeavors in the past. In 2013, the New York Times reported that Bloomberg News had killed an investigation that had threatened to upset Chinese officials.

Donald Trump has tried to paint his Democratic opponents as cosseted coastal elites who are in bed with China, exert undue influence over the mainstream media, and want to tell working-class Americans how to live. If Democrats somehow nominate Bloomberg, Trump’s ideal foil will be made of money instead of straw."

There are simply not enough stuffing-centric holidays on the calendar, and this is The Trailer.

Joe Biden speaks at a send-off rally for his ""No Malarkey!"" campaign bus tour in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Saturday. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)

DENISON, Iowa — The first stops of Joe Biden's ""No Malarkey!"" bus tour were busy, lively and not too crowded. Around 150 people came to kick off the tour in Council Bluffs, where an early November visit from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) had drawn 2,400.

Around 80 Iowans came to see Biden in Denison, fewer than attended a town hall with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg last week. When Biden made a surprise stop at a firehouse — the International Association of Fire Fighters was the first union to support him — just three firefighters were there to accept his gift of doughnuts. (The others were on call.)

That was fine. Other candidates could draw flashy crowds. Biden, as his supporters liked to explain, could win.

""Think about more than whom you like, or who best aligns with your political thinking,"" said former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack, as she introduced the candidate in Denison. ""I hope you'll think about the people who won't or can't participate in the caucuses but who will vote in the general election. I hope you'll think about the people in the middle, because those are the people who will decide the 2020 election.""

After nearly a year of campaigning, two months of it counterprogrammed against House impeachment hearings, the race for Iowa has become less about Democrats' own preferences and more what they imagine voters in the upper Midwest like. Both Biden and Buttigieg describe an electorate that is clearly ready to reject President Trump, so long as Democrats don't threaten to change too much about the country.

For much of the year, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) channeled Democratic frustration about the 2016 campaign into similar arguments: Democrats would win with transformational ideas, exciting the voters who had stopped trusting politicians. Biden's theory, and Buttigieg's, is that voters simply want to stop having to think so much about the president.

""I think character is literally on the ballot,"" Biden said in Denison. ""For Democrats, Republicans, independents: It's character. Is this person decent? Do they share my basic fundamental values? Do they understand that everybody deserves an even chance? Are they going to be straight with me? Are they authentic?""

Biden's tour, which will stretch through next weekend — he is taking just two pauses for fundraisers — is as focused on the ""electability"" question as anything he's done. Over the first day, he spent most of his time on two topics, the unfitness of the president (""our children are listening"") and his plan for rural America. Every Democrat who's competitive in Iowa has a rural plan, and in some ways, Biden's is less expansive; he sets aside $20 billion for rural broadband, for example, to $80 billion from Buttigieg and $85 billion from Warren. But Biden, unlike them, had helped pass big spending bills, so Biden, unlike them, could sketch out a future that looked comfortably like the past.

""The chances aren't being equally accessible to people these days,"" Biden said in Denison. ""If I become your president, that's going to be my focus. My focus is on why America was built the nation it was the first place. If the middle class does well, people are going to stay where they were raised.""

This wasn't too different from the pitch Hillary Clinton made to Iowans in 2016; she had promised a ""broadband-for-all"" investment that would get rural America fully wired by 2021. Iowa Democrats often say they're for more ambitious plans, too. Medicare-for-all remains, marginally, the most popular health insurance plan among caucus-goers, ahead of a ""public option."" It's the same for free tuition at public colleges and universities, and the same for the ""Green New Deal.""

The problem for supporters of those policies is that many Iowa Democrats worry Republican or independent voters won't agree with them. In those some Iowa polls, roughly a third of Democrats who support more left-wing policies suggest that candidates who support them are less electable. Gordon Reed, 64, who had caucused for Sanders in 2016, said that he had gotten behind Biden while deciding that Sanders, or Warren, could not win key states in a general election.

""Their policies bankrupt our government,"" Reed said in Denison. ""We don't have the money for it. I love their passion. I love their willingness to say what they want. But pragmatism has to win out. If I want a rib-eye steak, but I only have money for a hamburger, do I starve to death? Or do I buy the hamburger?""

The left's growing clout inside the Democratic Party, which has dramatically changed the party's default positions on health care, labor and abortion rights, has given Biden and Buttigieg ways to pitch their appeal to independents and Republicans. Both use populist rhetoric to explain why voters aren't ready for too much populism — why, instead, they want less political strife. After months of TV ads, even voters listening to rival candidates sometimes praise Buttigieg's fight-free vision of ""Medicare-for-all-who-want-it,"" a swerve away from the complicated Medicare-for-all debate.

For Biden, it's his riff on how ""Wall Street didn't build this country,"" which is disconnected from any other criticism of the financial industry and avoids Warren's and Sanders's call-outs of individual chief executives. (He has talked about repealing the 2017 tax cuts, which benefited the industry.) For Buttigieg, it's a series of arguments about how well-meaning left-wing ideas could alienate voters, warning (not always subtly) that candidates focused on ""fighting"" will just leave the country divided and the next president's agenda unfinished.

""We can gather the majority to drive those big ideas through without turning off half the country before we even get into office,"" Buttigieg says in his most recent Iowa ad; it deploys a populist argument against benefits for ""millionaires and billionaires"" to argue against universal free public college.

Buttigieg's college plan is actually more conservative than one Clinton rolled out during the 2016 campaign. Hers made public college free for families earning under $125,000 per year; for Buttigieg, the cutoff is $100,000. And Buttigieg's plan infuriated left-wing Democrats, who saw him trying to turn their own voters against a concept, ""college for all,"" that had been gaining steam.

""This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems,"" tweeted Ocasio-Cortez, after Buttigieg's ad went viral.

Biden, whose own advertising has not slighted other Democrats, has a deeper reserve of Democratic goodwill. That was on display as his tour began. A brief moment in Council Bluffs, where Biden's wife Jill accidentally clipped him with her hand and he jokingly bit her finger, went nuclear on conservative media; it got a warm laugh from the Bidens' hot-chocolate-sipping crowd. At every stop, Biden carved out time for conversations with voters, signing autographs or calling family members. When the interactions were over, volunteers materialized with clipboards, asking for help on caucus day. There is no flash, which is the point: Biden is the candidate voters know, which is why they know he can win.

""If you look at the polls in the states that really will decide who the next president will be, whether it's Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin, here, Florida, Ohio, there's one constant,"" said former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack on Saturday night, closing out Biden's first day on the bus. ""Joe Biden is doing better against Donald Trump than any other Democratic candidate. In fact, in almost all of those states, Joe Biden is beating the president by a considerable margin. So, that tells me this is the only thing, probably, that Donald Trump and I agree on. Joe Biden is the one that he's most concerned about.""

DEMS IN DISARRAY

The Working Families Party is a strange political specimen: It runs its own candidates, it commands its own ballot line, but it does not ""spoil"" elections for Democrats. That's because the party grew out of New York politics, where ""fusion voting"" allows candidates to run with the backing of multiple parties. While it has elected a few people on its own ballot line, it has pointedly declined to challenge Democrats even after bitter fights. Last year, after Cynthia Nixon fell short in her Democratic challenge to New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the WFP voted to drop Nixon from its ballot line and support Cuomo.

The party's reward: potential oblivion. As part of negotiations over the state's new electoral rules, state Democrats proposed raising the requirement for ballot access in a way that would hurt the left-wing party in particular. Currently, any New York political party must petition to make the ballot or get at least 50,000 votes for a statewide candidate to stay on automatically. State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, a member of the electoral reform coalition, now favors raising the requirement to 2 percent of total votes cast every two years, or 130,000 total votes, whichever is higher in the given year. If implemented now, that would strike the WFP from the ballot, along with every New York third party save for the Conservative Party.

“Governor Cuomo and Jay Jacobs were hellbent on punishing the WFP for our independence,"" New York Working Families Party Director Bill Lipton said in a statement. ""This is a power grab by the Governor and his allies to consolidate power and weaken independent progressive political organizing. The result is that New York will be the most hostile state in America to minor parties — if the changes hold up to legal scrutiny.""

There is virtually no outside support for the rule change. Elizabeth Warren, who won the national WFP endorsement this summer, has condemned the proposal, as has one of the city's major newspapers. ""Make it 100,000 and make it fair,"" wrote the editorial board of the New York Daily News, endorsing a change that would keep the WFP's ballot status. Even Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a sometimes target (but occasional ally) of the party, urged the commission to leave fusion voting in place and protect the WFP. If the rule is approved, it could hobble one of the faster-growing forces in left-wing politics, with repercussions for 2020.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, ""Big Ideas."" The ad that launched a thousand tweets, only some of them in Iowa. Buttigieg's latest velvet-gloved spot, one in a series in which he's contrasted more expansive Democratic plans with his own. ""There are some voices that say, 'Well, that doesn't count unless you go even further, unless it's free even for the kids of billionaires,'"" Buttigieg tells his audience. ""But I only want to make promises we can keep.""

United We Win, ""The Other Rhodes Scholar."" The second super PAC created to boost Cory Booker's campaign (he's tried and failed to wave them off) captures the zeitgeist in Iowa, assuming that its audience is already in love with Pete Buttigieg. ""He's a Rhodes scholar, a successful mayor, a uniter,"" says a narrator, before a jagged jump cut to Booker, whose own achievements have been getting some free media lately. It's the most negative ad ever run against Buttigieg as a presidential candidate, and it's not even that negative; it just suggests that Booker is better. (The ad also describes Newark's schools as ""number one for beating the odds,"" a superlative unbound by data.)

Cory Booker, ""Love."" The senator’s first ad in Iowa, coming less than two weeks before the qualifying deadline for December’s debate, is a quick run through of his inspirational stump speech: “From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, the truth of America is that we win when we come together and show the best of who we are against the worst that we face.” It could not be less like the super PAC ad, which is usually how these things work; third-party groups go negative where campaigns go positive. But again, Booker's said he does not want that PAC helping him.

One of the big questions (if not quite mysteries) of the primary last month was ""What happened to Elizabeth Warren?"" CNN's polling complicates one theory, that the pressure put on Warren in October's debate began moving voters away from her. Voters thought that Warren came off best that night; after November's debate, in which Warren was never attacked effectively, voters were more impressed by Buttigieg. It's tempting to find single causes for campaign's triumphs or struggles, but the damage to Warren looks more iterative.

The Democratic primary field shrunk again Sunday, with former Navy admiral and congressman Joe Sestak quitting the race and citing a lack of media coverage.

“Without the benefit of national press,” Sestak said in a statement, “it is unfair to ask others to husband their resolve and to sacrifice resources.”

Joe Biden. He got another congressional endorsement on Saturday: Rep. John Garamendi, a fixture of California politics and former lieutenant governor. ""The support that Joe Biden has received from within the state is well-deserved and characteristic of the broad coalition he has built,"" Garamendi said in a statement.

Elizabeth Warren. Before her Saturday town hall in Chicago, she got the support of Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a former leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; that particular pool of Democrats has been splitting between Warren and Sanders.

Pete Buttigieg. He spent Sunday at the Rev. William Barber's church in North Carolina before heading to South Carolina.

Cory Booker. On CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, he made another plea for support to make the next debate. ""If you want me in this race, if you want my voice and message, which is resonating, then I need help,"" Booker said. ""I am running on individual contributions and that’s what we are going to need to keep going.” Booker has enough individual donations to qualify for the debate but needs four qualifying polls (or two from early states).

Bernie Sanders. He made a return appearance on NBC’s “The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon;” on Sunday he made a run through South Carolina, speaking at a church and hosting an afternoon “eat and greet” for voters. ""It is not justice when so few have so much, and so many have so little,"" Sanders said at the service. ""Justice says that black women should not die in childbirth at three times the rate as white women.""

Kamala D. Harris. She returned to Iowa over Thanksgiving week for house parties, the focus of her rebooted caucus-centric campaign; she also began running a new digital spot.

Julián Castro. He's returning to California this week for more of the movements-first campaigning he's focused on; a homelessness roundtable, a Los Angeles news conference ""calling for accountability for the officers involved in the shooting of Grechario Mack,"" and finally a foreign policy speech at Stanford, his alma mater.

Cory Booker. On CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" he made another plea for support before the cutoff for the next debate.""If you want me in this race if you want my voice and message, which is resonating then I need help,” Booker said, asking supporters to contribute to his campaign. “I am not taking corporate PAC money. … I am running on individual contributions and that’s what we are going to need to keep going.”

Tom Steyer. He's spent the weekend in the Las Vegas area, from an ""anti-corruption roundtable"" to a women's luncheon to a meet-and-greet in little-visited Pahrump.

Marianne Williamson. She spent the weekend in Iowa, culminating in a World AIDS Day Event in Iowa City on Sunday night.

Andrew Yang. He's returning to New Hampshire this week and heading back to Iowa for a bus tour at the middle of the month; his campaign announced that it had its biggest fundraising day on Saturday, pulling in almost $750,000.

Tulsi Gabbard. For at least the second time, she's accused the Democratic National Committee of unfairly slanting debate access against her by not counting as a qualifier the Boston Globe/Suffolk poll, which found her at 6 percent support in New Hampshire. ""The pollster the Globe uses is recognized by the DNC for other media outlets,"" Gabbard said in a statement while campaigning in the Granite State. ""There is no reason the DNC should not recognize this Boston Globe poll, other than adherence to a subjective, nontransparent process where party elites try to dictate to the primary voters."" Gabbard needs just one more qualifying poll to access the December debate, but from the moment the party set its rules, the Globe/Suffolk poll was excluded.

ON THE TRAIL

WATERLOO, Iowa — In the waning days before Thanksgiving, two of the top contenders in Iowa got into a long-distance argument about transparency and ethics. They broke for the holiday before a lot of people noticed.

It began, sort of, on the day of the fifth Democratic debate. Buttigieg released tax returns from his time at the McKinsey consulting firm in 2007 and 2008, records he’d held on to during his two campaigns for mayor. He’d fulfilled a campaign promise, having told The Washington Post to expect the records before the Iowa caucuses, and he issued a challenge: “Every candidate in this race should be transparent with voters by disclosing their income in the private and public sectors.""

Only one of Buttigieg’s close competitors did any private-sector work of consequence: Elizabeth Warren. She’d released her tax returns from 2008 onward, starting with her service in the congressional panel overseeing TARP. But that was as far back as she went. For years before that, Warren was paid for legal advice in 56 cases, as disclosed by her campaign this summer.

""You've got to be prepared to lead by example on transparency,"" Buttigieg told reporters in Denison, Iowa. ""And that does mean disclosing your tax returns from both public and private sector work experience.""

Warren blew it off. ""I think anyone who runs for president should have to meet the same rule [as Barack Obama], and that would be the eight-year rule,"" she told reporters in West Des Moines. ""I’m already well past that.” She then turned the topic back to Buttigieg: ""There are some candidates who want to distract from the fact that they have not released the names of their clients and have not released the names of their bundlers.""

That statement applied only to Buttigieg, who, pressed on it, said that Warren was ""changing the subject,"" then rebuffed a CNN reporter who asked if he'd open his fundraisers to the press.

Both topics were pretty far from the center of Democratic primary debates. Joe Biden is the only Democrat who's holding traditional fundraisers who has allowed reporters into them; Warren's tax returns would reveal whether she was paid for additional legal work, but that work hasn't become a primary flash point.

By Sunday, when Warren returned to this small Iowa city, the issue had already burned out. She took questions instead about Buttigieg's newest criticism: that if free public college was not means-tested, it would benefit the children of millionaires and billionaires. Without repeating back his name, she disagreed: ""I think it's the right thing to do.""

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), among others, to break through. Both the Booker and Harris campaigns now seem in jeopardy.

AD

And to have any chance, the latest entrants, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, need Biden’s candidacy to collapse. Given the remarkable stability of Biden’s support after an initial drop in the summer, this opening may never come.

AD

In the meantime, Sanders’s loyalists on the party’s left have prevented Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) from consolidating the party’s progressive wing.

As a result, the roughly 40 percent of the party that supports either Biden or Sanders is, for the moment, largely out of the reach of other contenders. The remaining 60 percent floats around in search of an alternative.

AD

This dynamic has led to the latest twists in the campaign: Warren, after soaring to the top of the pack, has fallen back, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has emerged as a major figure in the contest.

The findings of two Quinnipiac polls, one released last week, the other in late October, underscored the volatility of the contest among those voters not committed to either Biden or Sanders.

In the October poll, Warren led the field with 28 percent, with Biden at 21 percent, Sanders at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

AD

The latest survey showed Biden back on top with 24 percent, Buttigieg at 16 percent, Warren at 14 percent and Sanders at 13 percent.

AD

The relative stability of the Biden and Sanders numbers pointed to another key finding in the November survey: Overall, only 33 percent of the Democrats surveyed said they had made up their minds. But 43 percent of Biden supporters and 49 percent of Sanders supporters expressed this degree of certainty; by contrast, only 29 percent of Warren backers and 25 percent of Buttigieg’s said they had made up their minds.

The survey did contain two pieces of good news for Warren, signs of her residual strength. She still ranks first as the candidate with the best policy ideas. And she was by far the leading second choice, picked as the alternative by 35 percent of Sanders’s supporters, 43 percent of Buttigieg’s and 19 percent of Biden’s.

AD

This could provide the basis for a comeback. But the news for now is of how a candidate who seemed briefly on the verge of dominating the contest (with leads nationally and in both Iowa and New Hampshire, which vote first) was pulled down by the sustained attacks of her opponents, wonks and pundits.

AD

The proximate cause of her decline was her struggle over a single-payer health plan. She endorsed it after showing an initial reluctance. Then she detailed a plan for how she would pay for it, to mixed reviews. Then she pulled back by saying she wouldn’t introduce a Medicare-for-all plan until her third year in office.

The saga was a lesson in how complicated defending single-payer would be in a general-election campaign. But the fact that Warren appears, for now at least, to have shed so much support so quickly is a measure of the unstable terrain in which candidates other than Biden and Sanders are trying to root their candidacies.

AD

It will now be Buttigieg’s turn to try to transform a surge of positive feeling into enduring support. He has, polls suggest, begun to break through with one group that had eluded him: whites without college degrees. But he is still being virtually shut out among African Americans, the most loyal component of the Democratic coalition.

AD

It is a Buttigieg strength that he is a fresh and intelligent voice well removed from past Democratic fights. But this leaves him without a history that sustains old loyalties of the sort that have benefited Biden and Sanders, candidates more than twice his age.

Whatever they disagree on, Democratic primary voters are united by their passion to defeat President Trump. The indecision in their ranks reflects their difficulty in deciding who among their current choices can get that job done.

Nor did it help that, while in person Bullock was warm, funny and quick, on TV he seemed stiff and awkward.

Finally, to a large extent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stole Bullock’s thunder on his top issue: trying to “rid our system of the corrupting influence of Dark Money,” as his written statement put it. Warren has launched a full-scale assault on corruption and a political system rigged in favor the rich and powerful. Whether in reference to a secret dinner for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the attempt to award the Group of Seven meeting to Trump’s own Doral property or the coziness of the Pentagon and the defense industry, Warren’s go-to phrase — “this is corruption, plain and simple” — helped her co-opt the issue.

As for the Montana governor’s future, Bullock reiterated Monday through a spokesperson that he will not run for the Montana Senate seat held by Republican Steve Daines. He should seriously rethink that position. He should consider not what he wants to do as a second act after he leaves the term-limited governorship, but what his party and country need him to do: help win control of the Senate.

Every issue he cares about, be it money in politics or trade or rural broadband or gun violence, will be impossible to address as long as Republicans, led by the self-proclaimed “Grim Reaper,” Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), retain the Senate majority. We have seen that no matter how many effective and urgently needed pieces of legislation the House passes (e.g., voting reform, guns, drug prices, nondiscrimination in employment for LGBTQ Americans), a Republican Senate can and will bury them. And the Senate has shown time and again it will rubber-stamp any Republican president’s executive or judicial branch nominee no matter how extreme or unqualified, while (as with Judge Merrick Garland) blocking consideration of a Democratic president’s nominees no matter how distinguished. Without the Senate majority, a Democratic president would be hobbled, and a (God forbid) second-term Trump would be free to populate the executive and judicial branches with more hacks and extremists.

As he likes to remind us, Bullock is the rare Democrat who can win in a red state that Trump carried by more than 20 points in 2016. If Bullock doesn’t run for Senate, Daines’s reelection is all but assured, and a potential pickup for Democrats is lost. With Bullock, Democrats’ chances to win the Senate improve immensely. (If they lose Alabama, they can still win the majority outright with Montana, Arizona, Colorado and Maine.)

Granted, the Senate is not a pleasant place these days. Any job that requires one to listen to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) drone on for hours (or days) at a time is not going to win awards for the best place to work in America. Nevertheless, what’s even less pleasant, and indeed downright scary, is living in a country in which Mitch McConnell controls the Senate, preventing any meaningful legislation from passing and enabling a lawless president and an intellectually and morally corrupt party to dominate our politics.

In his statement, Bullock declared, “On the difficult days, I would joke, ‘it’s worth the sacrifice because it’s only a fair shot at the American Dream and our representative democracy at stake.’ That truth remains.” Now he should prove his sincerity by running for Senate.

He affirmed that position Monday.

“While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S. Senate,” said Bullock’s communications director, Galia Slayen.

Bullock’s path to the presidency was premised on electability and a bet that Democrats would be intrigued by a governor who had won Trump voters without governing as a conservative. He focused his early efforts on Iowa, where Attorney General Tom Miller immediately endorsed him, and he raised $2 million in his first six weeks while emphasizing how he had saved Montana’s transparent campaign finance laws from conservative pressure.

AD

But his campaign never caught fire. Bullock missed the cutoff for the first debates in June because he was working with his Republican legislature to continue Montana’s Medicaid expansion. He narrowly secured a place onstage in the July debates, using his first question to criticize Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and warn that the party should not pick what he views as an unelectable nominee.

AD

“Watching that last debate, folks seemed more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives,” Bullock said.

Democratic voters panned that debate over its negativity and hyper-focus on Medicare-for-all, and Bullock did not qualify for future debates held under stricter polling and donation standards.

AD

He began to struggle for airtime, and his fundraising went flat.

In September, when House Democrats began an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, it became even harder for Bullock to get attention. His speech to Iowa Democrats’ Liberty and Justice Celebration was delivered to a near-empty arena; his plans on corporate taxes, infrastructure and labor law, released at the end of November, were largely ignored by the news media and voters.

AD

Bullock’s departure from the race comes after two other highly touted Democratic governors pulled the plug. Colorado’s John Hickenlooper switched to run for Senate, while Washington’s Jay Inslee decided to seek a third term. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is now the only candidate with experience as a state executive running for the Democratic nomination, announcing a last-minute bid two weeks ago — and noting that other candidates with bipartisan governing experience had not broken through.

THE KEY

Massive voting machine failures in a Pennsylvania county in November are giving election security advocates fresh ammunition to call for nationwide paper ballots.

The problems, which may have been caused by a software glitch, resulted in some Northampton County residents who tried to vote straight-ticket Democrat initially registering as straight-ticket Republican. It also incorrectly showed a Republican judicial candidate winning by a nearly statistically impossible margin, the New York Times’ Nick Corasaniti reports.

In this case, voters got lucky. The county had paper backups for all the votes the machine counted incorrectly. They showed the Democrat judicial candidate Abe Kassis — who the computer tally said got just 164 votes out of 55,000 ballots — actually narrowly won the race.

But about 16 million Americans spread across eight states won’t have a paper backup for their votes in 2020. That means a similar software glitch or a malicious hack by Russia or another U.S. adversary could cause mass uncertainty about an election’s outcome or even result in the wrong candidate taking office.

Even in Pennsylvania, it could have been different. The machines that malfunctioned in November were just purchased this year in response to a statewide mandate to upgrade to new voting machines with paper records.

Election security hawks have been pushing the importance of paper backups since 2016, when Russia probed election systems across more than a dozen states and penetrated systems in Illinois and Florida, according to the Mueller report. But even in 2016 there's no evidence any votes were counted incorrectly.

That's why the Pennsylvania debacle offers stark new evidence for how badly things could go wrong with no paper backups in place, degrading public faith in elections.

“People were questioning, and even I questioned, that if some of the numbers are wrong, how do we know that there aren’t mistakes with anything else?” Matthew Munsey, the chairman of the Northampton County Democrats, told Nick.

Lee Snover, chairwoman of the county Republicans, was just as worried. “There are concerns for 2020. Nothing went right on Election Day. Everything went wrong. That’s a problem,” she said.

Officials haven’t determined what caused the failures, but a senior intelligence official who focuses on election security told Nick there were “no visible signs of outside meddling by any foreign actors.” The miscount shows, however, how voting machine vulnerabilities could be exploited by Russia, China or Iran — which U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies said last month are all eager to interfere in the 2020 contest.

Presidential candidates were quick to make that connection.

Here’s Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who sponsored the main Senate bill that would deliver more election security money to states in exchange for paper ballots and other fixes.

All you have to do is read this to see why I’m focused on election security & passing my bills for back-up paper ballots & systematic audits. As Fiona Hill said, Russia is “gearing up.” And that’s just one possibility. https://t.co/4r3uJibzTS via @NYTimes — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) November 30, 2019

Here’s Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who dropped out of the race this morning:

Elections are the foundation of our democracy. It's far past time for us to invest in new equipment, poll worker training, and protections for our election systems from both physical and cyber threats. https://t.co/muBHVtQMcp — Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) November 30, 2019

House Democrats have passed bills that would require paper backups for all votes and deliver $600 million for states to upgrade voting machines and add other cybersecurity protections. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has blocked any bills that mandate specific election security fixes.

Some House Democrats were quick to seize on the Pennsylvania debacle to push the Senate to act.

Here’s Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.):

The story also sparked concern in states that will lack paper records for some voters in 2020.

Here’s John Ray Clemmons, a Democratic state representative from Tennessee:

This should concern (and, frankly, scare the heck out of) every Tennessean.

In this case, they found the problem because 99% of the Democratic votes weren't counted. But what if it was only 5%?https://t.co/ycWQVOkUeU — Sri Preston Kulkarni (@SriPKulkarni) December 1, 2019

Other states where some voters will lack paper records in 2020 are Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey and Mississippi, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.

Northampton also demonstrates the importance of automatic “risk limiting” audits after elections to make sure that paper records back up machine results.

In this case, there was such a wide margin of victory for the Republican candidate that it was obvious something was fishy. But if hackers or a software glitch caused a much smaller shift in votes, election officials might not have caught it without an audit.

Here’s Matt Blaze, co-founder of an annual challenge to find hackable bugs in election machines at the Def Con cybersecurity conference and a cryptography professor at Georgetown University:

The tally software clearly failed, giving the (apparent) actual loser a huge margin of victory (so large it wouldn’t ordinarily trigger a re-count). But an RLA WOULD catch this. So score one for RLAs. But... — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

It’s HUGELY fortunate that this happened in an off year, relatively low stakes local election rather than, say, the 2020 presidential race. Assuming we actually learn from the experience. — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

PINGED: The Trump administration is considering tightening Commerce Department rules to restrict sales of U.S. technology to Huawei even if that technology is in products manufactured outside the United States, two sources told Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld at Reuters.

The move follows a massive crackdown on U.S. companies selling directly to Huawei, which officials say could abet Chinese spying.

It could appeal to congressional China hawks who have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to keep U.S. technology out of Huawei's hands as it tries to dominate the market for next-generation 5G wireless networks. But it ""would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,” Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson told Reuters.

The potential change follows the Trump administration's decision last week to delay a blanket ban on most U.S. companies selling parts to Huawei for another 90 days.

Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

PATCHED: India's lead cybersecurity agency wants to audit WhatsApp's security systems after the accounts of 121 Indian users were allegedly hacked using tools from the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, Sankalp Phartiyal and Nigam Prusty at Reuters report.

Officials at the agency also want to know why WhatsApp executives, including CEO Will Cathcart, failed to mention the spyware attack when they met with Indian leaders in July and September. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, is suing NSO for the alleged hacks which affected roughly 1,400 users globally, including many journalists and activists.

The Indian government is also seeking answers from NSO on the malware attacks, Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. NSO has denied any wrongdoing.

PWNED: Just one-third of 2020 presidential campaigns are automatically rejecting or quarantining emails that come from suspicious domains and could be part of a phishing attack, TechCrunch's Zack Whittaker reports.

Candidates whose campaigns aren’t automatically rejecting suspicious emails include President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). That could put the campaigns at a higher risk of opening malware-laden phishing emails like the one that Russia used to target Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account in 2016.

“When a campaign doesn’t have the basics in place, they are leaving their front door unlocked,” Armen Najarian, chief identity officer at Agari, an email security company told Zack.

Campaigns for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are among those automatically rejecting or quarantining suspicious emails using a tool called DMARC, which verifies a sender's email is legitimate and rejects emails that may be spoofing a real email in order to trick the recipient. That's an increase from May, when Agari researchers found that only Warren was using DMARC to block spoofed emails.

The Policies

IMPEACHMENT BUT FIRST, MADRID: Impeachment mania is about to hit the House. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is overseas touting another important Democratic priority: tackling climate change.

Timing is everything: The delegation of more than a dozen Democrats to the United Nations's Convention on Climate Change serves as evidence that Pelosi is serious about her promise to “walk and chew gum” on impeachment — and to not lose sight of issues that affect everyday Americans even as the House heads into one of the most intense weeks of the inquiry against Trump so far.

Key: “Members are here because climate change is a critical issue for the U.S. and their constituents,” a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world.""

a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world."" More: ""The House is continuing its work as the impeachment inquiry continues, including taking important opportunities like this one to attend the annual UN climate conference.”

Climate change has steadily climbed up U.S. voters' list of concerns: Some 72 percent of Democrats called climate change an issue that's “very important” to them personally — second only to health care — in a CBS News poll from September.

Eye on 2020: President Trump promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions — but the pullout cannot take effect until at least a day after the 2020 presidential election. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration submitted an official notice to leave the accord, making the U.S. the only nation to abandon the global effort to address climate change.

Democratic lawmakers say they want to be clear that U.S. leadership on this issue would return if one of their candidates is elected to the Oval Office.

The message at the COP25 conference: “The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid.

“The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid. Castor, whose panel will release a report advising congressional committees on potential climate action by March of next year, said it's possible that the delegation will meet with other world leaders on the sidelines of the conference.

Busy week ahead: Upon the Speaker's arrival back in Washington, she'll hit the ground running as the House moves at a breakneck pace to investigate the potential impeachment of Trump.

Monday night: The House Intelligence Committee plans to review a report on the panel's investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The House Intelligence Committee plans to review a report on the panel's investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Tuesday: The Committee is expected to approve the release of the report, which is then “expected to be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump,” per our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian.

The Committee is expected to approve the release of the report, which is then “expected to be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump,” per our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. Wednesday: The House Judiciary Committee will begin hearings to “consider the historical and constitutional standards for impeachment,” Mike and Karoun report.

The House Judiciary Committee will begin hearings to “consider the historical and constitutional standards for impeachment,” Mike and Karoun report. Big picture: While Democratic leaders ""have not committed to a firm timeline, Tuesday’s meeting keeps the House on a trajectory to possibly approve articles of impeachment on the House floor before Christmas, setting up a Senate trial on Trump’s removal early in the new year.""

The agenda in Madrid is packed, too: Countries will be under pressure to make additional commitments to reduce their carbon emissions in the wake of a string of grim reports that show that the world is not on track to reach the Paris agreement's ambitious target.

Just last week the U.N. released its annual “emissions gap” report which showed that the Earth's average temperatures is on pace to rise 3.9 degrees Celsius, as opposed to the Paris accord's agreement to keep temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.” It's a priority for Pelosi: “Taking action to protect our planet is a public health decision for clean air and clean water for our children, an economic decision for creating the green, good-paying jobs of the future, a national security decision to address resource competition and climate migration and also a moral decision to be good stewards of God’s creation and pass a sustainable, healthy planet to the next generation,” Pelosi said in a statement this weekend.

Castor told Power Up that some Republican lawmakers were invited to join the delegation but all declined. There will be a small, relatively low-profile team of diplomats who will also be attending the summit on behalf of the Trump administration. They will be focusing on what Pompeo has described as “a realistic and pragmatic model” on climate issues.

“The U.S. team is set to be led by two career officials from the State Department: climate negotiator Kim Carnahan and Marcia Bernicat, a principal deputy assistant secretary,” per Bloomberg's Jennifer Dlouhy.

“And, in another shift, political appointees from the Trump administration also won’t be attending, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement,” Dlouhy reports.

Not impeachment: Trump will head to London for a meeting to mark NATO's 70th anniversary. Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey.

Trump will head to London for a meeting to mark NATO's 70th anniversary. Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey. Trump also hit the road over the holiday, taking a page from former President Bill Clinton's playbook: to look hard at work especially on the economy even as impeachment loomed: ""Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware,"" per our colleague Phil Rucker. This comes after Clinton's former chief strategist Mark Penn visited the White House last month.

The Investigations

THE WEEK AHEAD IN IMPEACHMENT:

The White House stays away: “White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday,” our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report.

The full 5-page letter is largely an attack on the House's impeachment process, arguing that Dems failed to provide enough opportunities for Trump to participate.

The biggest question is how long this refusal lasts : “Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings,” our colleagues write. The counsel pressed Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to detail plans for future hearings and questioned whether the White House would be able to cross-examine witnesses, including those who have testified in the public hearings.

What’s next?: The White House faces a Friday night deadline to detail what, if any, role they will plan in future proceedings.

Members of the Intelligence Committee will have 24 hours to review the report: It will be available to them starting at 6 p.m. tonight, Mike and Karoun report. “Their exact findings are not publicly known, but the report is expected to lay out a case for Trump’s abuse of his presidential powers — that he used the promise of a White House meeting and the withholding of military aid approved by Congress to compel Ukraine’s government to launch politically motivated investigations into his political rivals,” our colleagues write.

The Judiciary Committee is back in the spotlight: Wednesday's hearing will be the first from the panel that historically writes articles of impeachment since the Intelligence committee began its process. Four constitutional scholars are expected to testify on the standards for impeachment — three chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans, our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report. The names of the witnesses have not yet been released, much to Republicans' frustration.

Meanwhile, Republicans continue to slam the speedy timeline: Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, ""attacked the timeline that Democratic leaders are pursuing, one that appears aimed at concluding an impeachment vote in the House before Christmas rather, he argued, than providing appropriate due process for the president,"" per our colleagues.

“They want to get this president right now before everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year,” Collins said. “So we’re rushing this.""

And one senator, John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), “said that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so,” our colleague Felicia Sonmez reports. NBC's “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd pressed the senator on the fact that this is an argument that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to see repeated by American politicians.

Lisa Page breaks her silence: The former FBI lawyer spoke to Molly Jong-Fast for a Daily Beast profile that details the personal toll Trump's taunts have taken on her, Page's concern over the future of the FBI and, most importantly, why she feels an upcoming report from the Justice Department's inspector general report will show she did not act unprofessionally or show bias against Trump.

Key quote: “But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States,"" Page says of Trump's constant attacks. ""And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that. To try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he’s not publicly attacking me.”

I decided to take my power back.” Per Molly, ""the president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally"" in October.

The top-tier spending club is growing: Trump as president has delighted in hammering fellow members for not spending enough on their militaries.

Do not endorse: Trump's appearance will occur just days before Britain holds its national election. ""If past is prologue, the odds of Trump intervening in Britain’s electoral politics again in the coming days are high,"" our colleagues William Booth and Karla Adam report. The president is deeply unpopular in the country and his words could roil a campaign that is supposed to render the path forward for Brexit.

Trump is not currently set to meet with Johnson: For his part, Johnson ""tried to diplomatically dissuade the American president from offering his opinions on domestic affairs,"" our colleagues write. ""What we don’t do traditionally as loving allies and friends, what we don’t do traditionally, is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,"" Johnson said.

The Campaign

UPDATE ON THE TRAIL:

Biden rides the bus: “Former vice president Joe Biden kicked off an eight-day, 18-county bus tour Saturday as he ramps up his campaigning in rural Iowa,” the Des Moines Register's Stephen Gruber-Miller reports. It's dubbed the “No Malarkey” bus tour after one of the most famous Bidenisms.

Warren's numbers tank after Medicare-for-all debacle: “Recent polling suggests Warren has sustained political damage from her health-care policy. After climbing to the top of the field by focusing on a message of overhauling Washington and Wall Street, Warren plateaued as her campaign became consumed with health care,” our colleagues Annie Linskey, Jeff Stein and Dan Balz report.

Key graf: “The irony is that a candidate whose political identity has been built in part on her reputation as a policy wonk — a potential president who boasts of having a plan for nearly every challenge facing everyday Americans — has been tripped up by a policy issue that has dominated politics and defined her party for years,' our colleagues write.

Buttigieg goes on the offensive over college costs and gets slammed: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg unveiled a new ad attacking unnamed candidates (*cough* Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders) for wanting the government to cover the cost of everyone, “including the kids of millionaires.” The message fits perfectly with the more moderate tone Buttigieg is striking, but not everyone welcomed it.

AOC blasts Buttigieg: “This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently endorsed Sanders, wrote on Twitter.

Harris's campaign gets torched in scathing report: “In one instance after another, [Harris] and her closest advisers made flawed decisions about which states to focus on, issues to emphasize and opponents to target, all the while refusing to make difficult personnel choices to impose order on an unwieldy campaign,” the Times's Jonathan Martin, Astead W. Herndon and Alexander Burns report.

Key observation: “The 2020 Democratic field has been defined by its turbulence, with some contenders rising, others dropping out and two more jumping in just this month,” the Times reports. “Yet there is only one candidate who rocketed to the top tier and then plummeted in early state polls to the low single digits: [Harris].”

The #YangGang breaks the bank: “Andrew Yang raised $750,000 on Nov. 30, his single best fundraising day to date of his campaign,” Politico's Zach Montellaro reports. The crazy part? The haul was not tied to a debate or one of those end-of-quarter pleas that flood inboxes."

Goldman Sachs is popping up in some unexpected places — namely, the 2020 presidential campaign trail.

The Wall Street giant is seeking a rebrand by hosting forums for the candidates focused on small-business issues, as I wrote over the weekend.

The bank, through its “10,000 Small Businesses” program, has underwritten six of the events so far in Iowa and New Hampshire — including with former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

But not everybody’s showing up: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) both are declining to participate. “This is exactly what Sen. Sanders means when he talks about a corrupt political system,” spokesman Mike Casca said via email.

Goldman execs say the initiative is aimed at elevating small business issues in a presidential contest that has so far given them short shrift.

From the story:

Goldman Sachs’s executive vice president, John F.W. Rogers, chair of the firm’s foundation, which underwrites both the 10,000 Small Businesses program and the forums, said the events are “about putting this on the agenda of the candidates. I haven’t seen anybody say, ‘Here’s my plan for small business in America. Here’s how I’m going to address the regulations they face, the need for capital.’” “There seems to be a frustration that nobody thinks about the issues that challenge them,” Rogers said. “I hope some of these businesses will grow one day to become big enterprises and do business with Goldman Sachs,” but the firm has no direct economic stake in the program.

But the firm is also using the events to deepen its ties to the candidates, sending lobbyists from its Washington office to greet them. For the Harris event — which I attended in Ankeny, Iowa outside Des Moines — it was Joyce Brayboy, onetime chief to staff to former congressman Mel Watt (D-N.C.) who has worked for Goldman for more than a decade.

“This is the tip of the spear of Goldman’s whole strategy to reintroduce itself to America as a retail bank that cares about Main Street, rather than a global bank that was engaged in decades of illegal conduct that had devastating consequences for families across the country,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which advocates tougher regulation of the financial services industry. “This is one of the biggest banks in the world staging candidate forums not just as brand enhancement but also to put on their best face with the next president, who will be picking their regulators.”

The firm launched the “10,000 Small Businesses” program nearly a decade ago with the goal of putting that many entrepreneurs through an accelerated training in how to improve and grow their businesses. Some 9,100 have graduated, as the program grew from a pilot project at LaGuardia Community College in Queens to 19 locations, including three state-wide programs, and a national cohort. The firm decided to stage the presidential forums after it held a summit in early 2018 for graduates of the program, and 2,000 of them showed up.

Veteran Iowa political journalist David Yepsen, who moderates the forums in the Hawkeye State, said Goldman has no input into his questions. And financial regulation hasn’t come up. But the firm’s involvement is impossible to miss. More from the story:

The event was introduced by Des Moines Area Community College president Ron Denson, who touted the small-business program’s record helping its graduates expand their operations. Then the crowd heard from Elizabeth Hoppe, a coffee shop owner from Emmetsburg, Iowa, who credited her participation with enabling her to open a second location. She also thanked the bank for its “investment in small business and for providing these opportunities to discuss issues that impact our community.” On the same stage, in July, Booker name-checked Goldman’s small-business effort as a model that should be expanded. “That shouldn’t be the exception; that should be the rule,” he said, “because we know the majority of our jobs that are being created in America are jobs being created by small businesses.”

— Black Friday spending sets record: “Black Friday shoppers spent $7.4 billion online, the second largest Internet shopping day ever, according to data compiled by Adobe Analytics,” CNBC’s Alex Sherman reports.

“The $7.4 billion marked the biggest sales day ever for Black Friday and trailed only last year’s Cyber Monday’s $7.9 billion for the number 1 spot of all-time in online revenue, according to Adobe’s data. The average order value per consumer, at $168, was up nearly 6% year-over-year and also set a new Black Friday record. Adobe Analytics measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers.”

— U.S. hold on services economy slips. WSJ's Paul Kiernan: ""Over the past half-century, the U.S. has evolved from an industrial superpower into the undisputed champion of the global services economy. From 2003 to 2015, the U.S. trade surplus in services such as medical care, higher education, royalties and payments processing nearly sextupled to $263.3 billion. Growth has since stalled, however. Exports of services barely rose in the first nine months of 2019, while imports increased 5.5%. The services surplus, at $178.5 billion through September, was down 10% from the same period last year, on pace for its steepest annual decline since 2003.

""Some of the softness in service exports likely reflects cyclical factors, such as a strong dollar or slowing foreign economies. But economists say the decline in the surplus is difficult to pin exclusively on such issues. They point to other forces—some political, others more tectonic—that are weighing on exports while prompting American consumers and firms to buy more foreign services.""

— JPMorgan: Global economic pickup, mediocre returns ahead. Bloomberg News's Joanna Ossinger: ""JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists see next year’s expected global economic pick-up generating sub-par returns across the fixed-income, currency and commodity complex. Developed-market bonds, as might be expected, will be laggards, with JPMorgan projecting losses in the single-digit percent range. More surprising might be the single-digit losses in commodities. Investors will get gains elsewhere, but not to the same extent typically registered in economic rebounds, the bank says.""

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— China wants tariff rollback: “Beijing’s top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s Global Times newspaper reported on Sunday, amid uncertainty on whether the two sides can end a 17-month trade war that has depressed global growth,” Reuters reports.

“Global Times, published by the official People’s Daily newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also cited another unidentified source close to the talks as saying U.S. officials had been resisting such a demand because the tariffs were their only weapon in the trade war and giving up that weapon meant ‘surrender.’”

Meanwhile, China's economy is showing new signs of strenghth . WSJ: ""After months of slowdown, China’s economy showed signs of stabilizing, while Beijing said it won’t compete with other nations in easing policy. Surveys of manufacturers point to improving confidence and demand last month. The private Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.8 in November from 51.7 in October, Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit said Monday. China’s official manufacturing PMI, released Saturday, rose to 50.2 from 49.3. A figure above 50 represents expansion; below 50, contraction.""

— Huawei is doing just fine without American-made parts: “American tech companies are getting the go-ahead to resume business with Chinese smartphone giant Huawei Technologies Co., but it may be too late: It is now building smartphones without U.S. chips,” WSJ’s Asa Fitch and Dan Strumpf report.

“Huawei’s latest phone, which it unveiled in September—the Mate 30 with a curved display and wide-angle cameras that competes with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 11—contained no U.S. parts, according to an analysis by UBS and Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese technology lab that took the device apart to inspect its insides. … Huawei has made significant strides in shedding its dependence on parts from U.S. companies. (At issue are chips from U.S.-based companies, not those necessarily made in America; many U.S. chip companies make their semiconductors abroad.)”

— Olive oil market struggling even before tariffs kick in: “A prolonged slump in olive-oil prices is whipping up discontent among farmers in southern Europe and North Africa,” WSJ’s Joe Wallace and Adria Calatayud report. “A prolonged slump in olive-oil prices is whipping up discontent among farmers in southern Europe and North Africa.”

“A rich olive harvest in Spain, the world’s dominant producer, has left the market flooded with olive oil. The glut comes just as demand is set to slow in the U.S., the biggest importer of the product, after President Trump in October imposed a 25% tariff on olive oil coming from Spain. The tariff was part of a package of levies designed to retaliate against the European Union for giving subsidies to plane-maker Airbus SE.”

— Cable execs not worried about 5G: “For about the last two decades, the cable industry has been fueled by three revenue streams: cable television, landline phones and high-speed broadband. … Recently, though, cable’s prized triple play has started to erode,” CNBC’s Alex Sherman reports.

“Investors don’t appear concerned. Cable internet has high profit margins and growth has been so strong that the two largest U.S. cable companies, Comcast and Charter, are both trading near record highs even as their business is fragmenting. Comcast added 379,000 residential high-speed broadband customers last quarter, its strongest third quarter in a decade. … While 5G is generating a ton of buzz for its ability to supposedly handle the massive amounts of data coming from artificial intelligence workloads and self-driving cars, the technology has limitations when it comes to replacing cable infrastructure.”

“Lynch, once hailed as Britain’s answer to Bill Gates, is currently battling the American IT giant in London’s High Court. HP is seeking damages of $5 billion from Lynch and his former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain, alleging that they inflated the value of their data firm before selling it.

A Senate committee has approved a bipartisan bill to do just that. And the plan is going nowhere fast. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the bill’s sponsor and chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, expressed pessimism in an interview that the measure would soon hit the floor, saying Trump would have to lean on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and more Republicans would need to get behind it. 'It would be dependent upon the White House asking him to do it at this point,' said the Iowa Republican.""

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: A decade that began with the Arab Spring is ending with street protests from Asia to South America and the Middle East.

Violent clashes between police and people across the planet foreshadow what will almost certainly be another volatile decade for geopolitics. The United States will need to contend in the 2020s with the growing risk of war with Iran, plus an expansionist China, a revanchist Russia and deepening cooperation between those strategic foes.

When you widen the aperture, recent demonstrations underscore not just a pervasive discontent with authoritarian regimes but also the simmering anti-elite sentiments that led to Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

The resignation on Sunday of embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi amid sustained protests for sweeping reform has set the stage for a new political crisis as the ruling class scrambles to address demonstrators’ grievances. A human rights official said more than 430 demonstrators have been killed during two months of unrest. Thousands of demonstrators are still camped out in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. This is the biggest challenge to Iraq’s political order since the U.S.-led coalition topped Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Across the border, the Iranian regime is using more violence than at any time since the Islamist revolution four decades ago to repress protests. Between 180 to 450 people, and possibly hundreds more, have reportedly been killed since the government, facing pressure from punishing U.S. sanctions, jacked up gas prices two weeks ago. Another 2,000 have been wounded and 7,000 more have been detained, according to some reports.

The last wave of major protests, which led to at least 72 people being killed, was in 2009 after a contested election. Mir Hossein Mousavi, the 77-year-old opposition leader who “lost” that election and has been under house arrest, released a rare statement on Saturday that compared this most recent crackdown to Black Friday in September 1978 when the Shah’s soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Jaleh Square, a spark that ignited the revolution.

Meanwhile, in Lebanon, members of the military formed a human chain on Sunday near the presidential palace outside Beirut to prevent violent clashes from breaking out between rival Lebanese protesters as a stalemate over forming a new government continues. Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned about a month ago in the face of protests accusing the elite of corruption and economic mismanagement, but President Michel Aoun has not formally begun the process of forming a new government.

Pro-democracy supporters rally on Monday in Hong Kong. (Vincent Thian/AP)

-- In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully in one of several authorized rallies on Sunday were dispersed with tear gas, ending a rare period of peace amid half a year of pro-democracy protests in the territory.

“The march in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side of the city had a clear message: The five demands of the protest movement, including universal suffrage and an investigation into the Hong Kong police, are not to be forgotten,” Shibani Mahtani reports from the ground. “Protesters including the elderly and children, some of whom were carrying banners calling for the end of the Chinese Communist Party, said their fight must go on despite several key successes. Residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates in local elections last week in what was widely interpreted as a resounding message of support for the cause. Those winners now control 17 out of Hong Kong’s 18 electoral districts.”

These protests began in June when the government took up a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, which would have undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy. The government withdrew that proposal, but that’s only one of the five demands. One of the other four is an independent investigation into police conduct. Authorities have resisted any accountability.

Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, endorsed an independent investigation into police brutality over the weekend. “I appeal to the government to take important confidence-building measures, including a proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police,” Bachelet wrote on Saturday in the South China Morning Post. The Chinese government criticized her comments as “inappropriate” and said her op-ed would “embolden the rioters.” (The communists derisively refer to the pro-democracy activists as rioters.)

-- South America is facing its most widespread outbreak of popular uprisings this autumn since the Cold War, from the Caribbean coast to Patagonia. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier recently explored the causes: “In Chile, fury over a pocketbook issue — a subway fare increase — has snowballed into a deeper movement against elites and a right-leaning, democratically elected government. In Peru, the street rose up to back President Martín Vizcarra in his crusade to close down a corrupt Congress. In Ecuador, indigenous groups and left-leaning students pressured their government into restoring gasoline subsidies. In Bolivia, pro-democracy and right-wing forces drove power-clinging president Evo Morales from office after his socialists stood accused of stealing an election. In Venezuela, an outlier in the current protests, a starving nation has risen up — unsuccessfully, so far — against a socialist dictatorship accused of destroying the economy.

“But all of these events are taking place against a shared backdrop: the painful aftermath of a commodities boom. Rising prices of the fuels, minerals and crops at the heart of the region’s resource-rich economies at the start of the 21st century helped lift millions out of poverty. The revenue also raised expectations — expectations now unmet in the half-dozen years since the boom went bust. A new middle class fears slipping back down the socioeconomic ladder. As nations tighten their belts in leaner times, the pressure is hitting the poor and middle classes disproportionately, while elites are largely shielded — fueling grass-roots rage. Add weak institutions, structural inequality, political polarization and a corrupt ruling class unwilling to cede power, and you have a recipe for regional unrest.”

-- There’s an inspiration factor at play, as the wind of freedom blows across borders. Though their grievances are quite different, for example, activists in the streets of Santiago have cited the struggle in Hong Kong and adopted many tactics of those protesters. Democracy has been in recession for years now, but the streets are speaking. What will come of the unrest? The truth is that we don’t know how these stories will end, which is always true but still always scary.

-- Recent scenes from Hong Kong to Iran are a testament to the power and possibility of American moral leadership when Washington gets engaged. Under bipartisan pressure, on Thanksgiving eve, Trump signed into law the resolution that passed Congress with only one holdout to offer support for the people of Hong Kong. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters celebrated by draping themselves in American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Many waved posters thanking Trump by name.

-- In protest, China announced today it will suspend U.S. Navy port visits to Hong Kong and sanction several pro-democracy organizations after Trump signed the bill. “While the nature of the sanctions remained unclear, the move appeared to back up Chinese threats that the U.S. would bear the costs of the decision,” per the AP. “The steps are ‘in response to the U.S.’s unreasonable behavior,’ foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, adding that the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act ‘seriously interfered’ in China’s internal affairs. … Along with suspending visits by official U.S. military ships and aircraft, Hua said China would sanction organizations including the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, Human Rights Watch, the International Republican Institute, Freedom House, and others that she said had ‘performed badly’ in the Hong Kong unrest.”

-- Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign is achieving its desired impact of punishing Iran, but it remains to be seen whether this will bring Tehran to the table or prompt the theocrats who are calling the shots to lash out militarily. The White House announced late last night that Trump “discussed the threat from Iran” in a Sunday phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, who is fighting for his political life and facing a possible third national election in a year, accused six European countries on Sunday of trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. “While the Iranian regime is killing its own people, European countries rush to support that very murderous regime,” Netanyahu said in a televised address on Sunday. Israel’s Foreign Ministry singled out Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Trump is meeting with the leaders of these and other European counties at the NATO summit in London on Tuesday and Wednesday.

-- A front-page story in today’s New York Times has details on how the Iranian government has massacred civilians: “It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50 percent in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders. In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators — mostly unarmed young men — in a marsh where they had sought refuge. …

“Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran’s post-revolutionary hierarchy. The authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country. On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked, which if true suggested a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. … The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said.” (The Guardian also has excellent fresh reporting on the regime’s brutal crackdown in Shiraz.)

-- Ultimately, the repression doesn’t solve the underlying frustrations that prompted protesters to so boldly risk arrest across Iran. It seems a safe bet that there will be more violence in the streets going forward. “These riots are not the last ones and it definitely will happen in the future,” said Revolutionary Guard acting commander Gen. Ali Fadavi, according to the AP.

-- Looking ahead in Iraq, a showdown looms in parliament over who will now lead the fragile democracy. Erin Cunningham and Mustafa Salim report from Baghdad: “Abdul Mahdi was appointed after months of political wrangling in parliament. His departure, approved by lawmakers on Sunday, offers authorities a chance to begin enacting real change, lawmakers and analysts said. Iraqis are fed up with high unemployment rates, widespread graft and a lack of government services. … But parliament — which is made up of rival political blocs, none of which hold a commanding majority — is unlikely to agree on a replacement, some lawmakers said. Parliament has just 15 days to choose a prime minister, who will then be granted 30 days to form a government.

“The leaders of the two largest coalitions — Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand Shiite cleric, and Hadi al-Amiri, who is backed by Iran — have publicly split over the prime minister’s resignation. In a statement last month, Sadr vowed never to work toward a political consensus with Amiri again after the latter apparently backtracked on an agreement to subject Abdul Mahdi to a no-confidence vote in parliament. Amiri was a key leader of the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of Shiite militias that was formed to battle Islamic State militants and that has enjoyed considerable support from Iran. Iran has played a significant role in Iraqi politics since Tehran threw its weight behind the militias. But that support might have backfired. Demonstrators in majority-Shiite cities such as Najaf and Karbala have stormed or burned Iranian consulates and defaced posters of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. …

“Even as lawmakers paid lip service to the need for change, they conceded that a new leader would inherit a restive and fractured nation reeling from a security crackdown that appears to have only hardened protesters’ resolve. On Sunday, a demonstrator was killed by security forces in Baghdad as the sides clashed on Rasheed Street, officials said. Demonstrators have sought to protect the vast protest site they have set up in Tahrir Square and surrounding streets, which they have transformed into a mini-republic with art installations, medical facilities, restaurants and free libraries. Police have tried to prevent demonstrators from crossing bridges that lead to government buildings and embassies in the heavily secured Green Zone.”

-- The struggle between lower-case-D democrats and autocrats will persist in the 2020s. It’s a brave new world out there. Effective Sunday, for example, the Chinese government began requiring facial scans for anyone to be able to get a cellphone or SIM card. “The policy is part of a broader push by the Chinese government to limit people’s ability to stay anonymous online,” Quartz reports.

Starting today, an 1,800-mile pipeline is set to begin delivering Russian natural gas to China. The $55 billion project is Moscow’s most significant energy play since the collapse of the Soviet Union. “The Power of Siberia pipeline is a physical bond strengthening a new era of cooperation between two world powers that have separately challenged the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reports.

As much as Trump may enjoy the company of strongmen, and politicians in both parties preach isolationism and protectionism to soothe constituents who have grown weary of war and nation-building, the United States remains locked in an existential struggle with the dark forces of autocracy that dates to our founding.

-- Closing the book on the 2010s: It didn’t really sink in for me until Thanksgiving that this tumultuous decade is ending. It’s not that I can’t read a calendar. It’s just that there are so many unfinished storylines. Years from now, however, there will be television documentaries and books that isolate the 2010s as a distinct chapter in our nation’s history. If you could sum up the teens in one word or phrase, what would it be? Besides Trump, what do you think was the single most important story of the decade? Email me at James.Hohmann@washpost.com. I’d love to highlight the most thoughtful answers here this week.

IMPEACHMENT LATEST:

-- White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter last night that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report: “The invitation from Chairman Jerrold Nadler ‘does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process,’ Cipollone wrote. … Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings but asked Nadler to detail his plans for the upcoming proceedings, including whether he would allow further testimony and cross-examination of fact witnesses, among them those who already testified before the House Intelligence Committee. He also said Republicans should be able to call additional witnesses. … On Sunday, Democrats called on the White House to cooperate, suggesting an innocent person would have no problem testifying. ‘We’re certainly hoping that the president, his counsel, will take advantage of that opportunity if he has not done anything wrong,’ Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said on ABC News’s ‘This Week.’ ‘We’re certainly anxious to hear his explanation of that.’

“But there is a conflict inside the GOP over the extent to which Trump and his congressional defenders ought to engage, even as Republicans signaled they will continue their aggressive campaign to delegitimize the process as corrupt and unfair. Speaking on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he understood why the White House might want to skip the Wednesday hearing, calling it ‘just another rerun’ covering ground already surveyed in previous Judiciary Committee hearings. ‘This is a complete American waste of time right here,’ he said. But he added that Republicans would be more keen to participate in future hearings — particularly one examining the findings of the House Intelligence Committee as prepared by its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).” Members of the Intelligence Committee are expected to review the draft of the Schiff report today and vote tomorrow (presumably on party lines) to formally transmit it to the Judiciary Committee.

-- Volodymyr Zelensky is stepping up his fight against corruption in Ukraine, despite the risk that he will anger Trump by doing so. Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern report: “By the end of this month, more than 500 Ukrainian prosecutors will be out of their jobs as part of sweeping professional reviews under [Zelensky]. Among the prosecutors heading for the exit: a key Kyiv contact for Rudolph W. Giuliani. The prosecutor purge is just one of several corruption-busting efforts set in motion by Zelensky. But it puts into sharp relief Zelensky’s twin challenges — trying to balance his clean-government promises at home with his needs to keep President Trump from turning against him. Zelensky’s bind is not hard to spot. … Now that Zelensky’s reform push is underway, some of those Giuliani-linked officials are in the crosshairs. A prosecutor named Kostiantyn H. Kulyk is one of the first. Zelensky’s new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka — ‘100 percent my person,’ Zelensky told Trump in July — last week gave a dismissal notice to Kulyk, a key player in the effort to provide Giuliani with political ammunition of dubious accuracy.”

-- Zelenksy pushed back on Trump’s claims about corruption in Ukraine: “If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us,” he told Time Magazine and three European news outlets in a sit-down on Saturday. “I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo.” He said that Ukraine still needs U.S. support to have a chance to get back the territory Russia seized in 2014, starting with the Crimean Peninsula. He said Trump calling Ukraine corrupt makes it hard to attract foreign investment. “When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals,” he said.

“Zelensky has already learned to temper his expectations,” Time notes. “He does not expect his first round of peace talks with Russia, which are scheduled to take place in Paris on Dec. 9, to end the war that has been raging along their border for the past five years. Nor does he expect too much from his Western allies going into these negotiations.”

-- Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers who has kept a lower profile than Giuliani, says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a New York Times profile. Unlike Giuliani, Sekulow does get compensated for representing Trump. His son Jordan and his law partner Stuart Roth are also on the Trump payroll.

-- Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page spoke to the Daily Beast after two years of silence: “Page, of course, is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news. They were hijacked by Trump to fuel his 'deep-state' conspiracy. For the nearly two years since her name first made the papers, she’s been publicly silent (she did have a closed-door interview with House members in July 2018). I asked her why she was willing to talk now. ‘Honestly, his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel’s back,’ she says. The president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally on Oct. 11, 2019. That was the moment Page decided she had to speak up. ‘I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,’ she says. ‘It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.’ ...

""On Dec. 9, the Justice Department Inspector General report into Trump’s charges that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign will come out. Leaked press accounts indicate that the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump. How does it feel after all this time to finally have the IG apparently affirm what she’s been saying all along? She said she wouldn’t discuss the findings until they were officially public, but she did note: ‘While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don’t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people. The president has a very loud megaphone.’”

-- Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) claimed that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so. Felicia Sonmez reports: “‘I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,’ Kennedy told host Chuck Todd on NBC News’s ‘Meet the Press’ on Sunday. Todd pressed Kennedy on whether he was concerned that he had been ‘duped’ by Russian propaganda, noting reports that U.S. intelligence officials recently briefed senators that ‘this is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine.’ Kennedy responded that he had received no such warning. … Kennedy argued Sunday that Ukraine’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign have been ‘very well-documented,’ citing reporting by the Economist, the Financial Times, the Washington Examiner and others. … Despite Kennedy’s claim, there is no evidence that the Ukrainian government engaged in a large-scale effort to aid Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.”

-- The only lawmaker involved in three impeachment probes said Trump’s Ukraine conduct is “more serious” than Richard Nixon’s during Watergate. From CNN: “Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who helped draft an article of impeachment against Nixon as a congressional staffer and served on the House Judiciary Committee during President Bill Clinton's impeachment, [said] that she agrees with [Schiff] that Trump's actions involving Ukraine are ‘far more serious’ than Watergate. Congressional Democrats -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and, on Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- have compared Trump's involvement with Ukraine to the scandal that prompted Nixon to resign in 1974 rather than be impeached. ... ‘President Nixon's misconduct related to trying to use the levers of government to hide the Watergate burglary ... His misconduct had to do with trying to throw the election but at least it didn't involve involving other foreign nations,’ said Lofgren ... ‘If you take a look at the -- what the founding fathers were concerned about, it was the interference by foreign governments in our political system that was one of the gravest concerns. Nixon's behavior didn't fall into that range. So in that way, this conduct is more serious.’”

2020 WATCH:

-- Montana Gov. Steve Bullock dropped out of the presidential race this morning. He was the only Democratic candidate who had won statewide in a state Trump carried in 2016, and he was the only sitting governor in the race. Bullock said he does not plan to run for Senate. Dave Weigel reports: ""Bullock, 53, entered the race in May, arguing that a group heavy on Washington experience needed an outsider from a 'Trump state.' He rejected entreaties from national Democrats to run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Steve Daines, telling reporters that he had no interest in the job. He affirmed that position Monday. 'While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S. Senate,' said Bullock’s communications director, Galia Slayen.""

-- Former congressman Joe Sestak is also out of the race. Sestak (D-Pa.) launched his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination about five months ago, Felicia Sonmez reports.

-- Pete Buttigieg is still struggling to win over black voters. This weekend, he used a North Carolina church visit to issue a “moral call to unity.” Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The Greenleaf Christian Church is pastored by the Rev. William J. Barber II. Barber’s effort to revive Martin Luther King Jr.’s last major project — the Poor People’s Campaign of 1968 — has inspired a multiracial movement to oppose [Trump], with plans for an assembly and ‘Moral March on Washington’ in June 2020. Buttigieg’s decision to worship with the Disciples of Christ congregation underscored the task that awaits him as he seeks to convince voters that he can credibly lead a diverse coalition to capture the White House. … The 56-year-old pastor pointedly declined to ask Buttigieg about his sexuality, saying he would no more put the question to an airline pilot. ‘But I did ask him, ‘Could he fly the plane?’ Barber remarked, as applause rang out in the pews. Barber was hardly silent on the theme, however. He opened the service by denying that anti-gay hostility was pervasive in the black community.""

-- ICYMI: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is expected to nominate financial executive Kelly Loeffler to the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). The Atlantia Journal-Constitution broke the story Friday, and other outlets have confirmed it. This defies a pressure campaign from Trump to get Kemp to put up Doug Collins, who has been an outspoken Trump defender on cable television.

-- Google and YouTube took down more than 300 video ads for Trump that violated the company's policy. From CBS News: “Lesley Stahl asked [YouTube CEO Susan] Wojcicki, ‘Have you taken down any of President Trump's ads at all?’ YouTube's CEO responded, ‘There are ads of President Trump that were not approved to run on Google or YouTube.’ When pressed for an example, Wojcicki added, ‘Well, they're available in our transparency report.’ In response to concerns raised after the 2016 election cycle, Google and YouTube, like Facebook, keep a searchable archive of political ads that have run on the site. 60 Minutes reviewed the archive to learn more about President Trump's problematic political ads. We found that over 300 video ads were taken down by Google and YouTube, mostly over the summer, for violating company policy. But the archive doesn't detail what policy was violated. Was it copyright violation? A lie or extreme inaccuracy? Faulty grammar? Bad punctuation? It's unclear. The ads determined to be offending are not available to be screened. We found very little transparency in the transparency report.”

-- Another reminder that elections have consequences: The Supreme Court will today wade into the gun control debate for the first time in a decade, making advocates for gun control nervous. From NBC News: “The court has steadfastly declined to take up any gun rights cases since ruling in 2008's Washington, D.C. v. Heller that the Second Amendment provides a right to keep a handgun at home for self-defense, and later clarifying in 2010's McDonald v. Chicago that the right applies nationwide. Now the court's willingness to take the New York case — even though the law at issue was recently repealed — has gun rights supporters feeling optimistic that it could lead to a ruling about the right to bear arms outside the home. Gun control advocates, in contrast, fear the court's new conservative majority may produce a decision that the National Rifle Association could use to fight against many of the 300 local gun restrictions enacted since the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. ‘What's really on the line is our progress against gun violence and the future of life-saving gun safety laws,’ said Hannah Shearer of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.”

-- America’s divided left is losing the battle on abortion. From the Times: “Interviews with more than 50 reproductive rights leaders, clinic directors, political strategists and activists over the past three months reveal a fragmented movement facing longstanding divisions — cultural, financial and political. Many said that abortion rights advocates and leading reproductive rights groups had made several crucial miscalculations that have put them on the defensive. ‘It’s really, really complicated and somewhat controversial where the pro-choice movement lost,’ said Johanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University who has studied the history of abortion. National leaders became overly reliant on the protections granted by a Democratic presidency under Mr. Obama and a relatively balanced Supreme Court, critics say, leading to overconfidence that their goals were not seriously threatened. Their expectation that Mr. Trump would lose led them to forgo battles they now wish they had fought harder, like Judge Merrick B. Garland’s failed nomination to the bench. Local activists in states like Alabama, Georgia, North Dakota and Missouri where abortion was under siege say national leaders lost touch with the ways that access to abortion was eroding in Republican strongholds.”

The City Hall of Villa Union is riddled with bullet holes after a gun battle between Mexican security forces and suspected cartel gunmen on Saturday. At least 19 people were killed, four of them police officers when an armed group in a convoy of trucks stormed the town 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex. (Gerardo Sanchez/AP)

MORE ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- At least 19 were killed in northern Mexico after members of a cartel battled with police and the army at a city hall. Mary Beth Sheridan reports: “The assault started at around noon on Saturday, the eve of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s first anniversary in office. Polls show Mexicans regard the failure to curb violence as the greatest weakness of the generally popular leftist leader. … The attack in the town of Villa Union, around 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex., highlighted how the splintering of Mexico’s top cartels has sparked more violence. It was believed to be carried out by the Cartel of the Northeast, an offshoot of the once-powerful Zetas, which is based in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Several groups that spun off from the Gulf and Zetas cartels are fighting with each other in Tamaulipas and nearby states. The attackers swept into Villa Union in at least 14 trucks, some of them armored and bearing the cartel’s logo ... The gunmen unleashed a furious battle at the town hall, peppering the facade with bullets. Terrified residents shut themselves in their homes as the pop-pop-pop of gunfire filled the air ... The attackers fled after about 90 minutes ... Mexican police and soldiers, backed by army helicopters, chased them in an operation that stretched into Sunday morning ... The dead included four state police officers, 13 alleged cartel members and two civilians kidnapped and killed by the attackers, according to Coahuila Gov. Miguel Riquelme.”

The shootout comes days after Trump said he was planning on designating Mexico’s cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, a move Mexico’s government rejected. Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to visit Mexico City this week to discuss Trump’s plan.

-- Authorities in Mexico arrested several people suspected of involvement in the killings of nine members of the LeBaron family, an extended clan of American Mormons living in Sonora. Sheridan reports: “Officials didn’t provide details, and the attorney general’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The newspaper El Universal cited sources as saying three people were arrested in Bavispe, not far from La Mora. … Julian LeBaron, a family spokesman and longtime anti-violence activist, said the three suspects detained Sunday were low-level ‘thugs.’ He and about 50 other members of his extended family are scheduled to meet with López Obrador on Monday morning. ‘We think that’s the reason why they went and picked up these local thugs — so these people can say, ‘Yeah, we did something about this,’’ he said. He said the family wasn’t satisfied with the arrests of the triggermen, but wanted the detention of ‘the people who were responsible for giving the order’ to carry out the attack.”

-- Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. Rachel Siegel reports: “‘Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers,’ Trump said in Monday morning tweet. He then directed his attention to the Federal Reserve, saying that the body should ‘act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies. This makes it very hard for our manufactures & farmers to fairly export their goods. Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!’ … The surprise announcement came after it appeared that the White House was preparing to dial back its adversarial trade approach in the months leading up to next year’s elections. … Earlier in Trump’s presidency, in March 2018, top steel suppliers including Brazil, South Korea and Japan complained that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect. At the time, Brazil was the No. 2 steel supplier to the United States.”

-- The victims in the London Bridge fatal stabbing attack were recent Cambridge University graduates dedicated to prison reform. Kim Bellware reports: “Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was identified Sunday by London’s Metropolitan Police as the second fatality in the attack. Jack Merritt, a 25-year-old from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, was identified Saturday. Both were involved with Learning Together, a prison-based education program of Cambridge. Merritt was a coordinator and Jones was a volunteer, university officials said. Jones’s family described her as ‘a funny, kind, positive influence’ whose death leaves ‘a huge void.’ … Jones’s family also highlighted her dedication to criminal justice. That passion, they said, had prompted her to apply to a police graduate recruitment program in which she hoped to specialize in victim support. … Merritt, the program coordinator at Cambridge’s Learning Together program, was remembered by his family as a ‘beautiful, talented boy’ who ‘always took the side of the underdog.’ … Merritt’s family urged the public not to use his death as a justification for the kinds of punitive sentencing he fought against.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his rival Jeremy Corbyn traded blame over the early release of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, a convicted Islamist terrorist who was let go from prison halfway through his 16-year sentence for plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange. William Booth reports: “Khan, who was freed on parole 11 months ago with an electronic tracking device on his ankle, began his attack Friday afternoon as he was entering a conference intended to rehabilitate violent offenders and terrorists. … Johnson, appearing on a BBC political affairs show, said ‘the reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release, which was brought in by a lefty government.’ He was referring to the government of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, which ended in 2010. … Johnson refused to concede any responsibility. Whatever the Tories failed to do in the past, his government will fix it if he wins a majority in the Dec. 12 elections, he said. … Corbyn, Johnson’s principal opponent in the elections, called the government’s early release of Khan ‘a complete disaster’ and called for a ‘very full investigation.’ In a speech in York on Sunday, Corbyn took aim at the cuts to police forces since the Conservatives came into power — a deficit of some 20,000 officers compared to years before.”

-- Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said he will step down next month, after an investigation into the 2017 killing of a journalist raised questions about the role of his former chief of staff and ensnared other members of his inner circle. Chico Harlan reports: “‘This is what the country needs at the moment,’ Muscat said in a nationally televised address. He said he would resign as leader of his own party on Jan. 12 and step down as prime minister of the Mediterranean island nation of half a million people in ‘the days after.’ The decision was the largest political convulsion yet in the investigation into the car bomb death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a widely read investigative journalist who focused on the corruption of Maltese politicians and other power brokers.”

-- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the U.S. must avoid a “hot war.” From CNN: “Back in 1989, the United States and the Soviets were on opposite sides of the conflict, with Washington supporting mujahideen fighters trying to topple the government of Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime. But just over two years later, the USSR collapsed, assistance to the Kabul government dried up and Najibullah's government fell. Asked what lessons could be drawn from the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Gorbachev said: ‘They must be withdrawn. That is the main lesson. You know, it's like a match. The match is lit, a fire spreads. And these clashes, when the leading, largest countries in this conflict become ever more involved, they are dangerous for all nations.’

""The fall of the Berlin Wall was preceded by another pivotal moment: The signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987. That pillar of arms control effectively fell apart this year, after the United States formally withdrew and the Russian government said it had been consigned to the trash can. Asked about the demise of the treaty that he signed alongside Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev expressed a hope that such arms control agreements could be revived. … The ultimate goal of arms control, he added, must be to get rid of nuclear weapons completely. That, however, seems a more remote possibility, given the enduring mistrust between Moscow and Washington. US-Russian relations are now at their worst since the Cold War, but Gorbachev expressed hope that it would be possible for Washington and Moscow to find a way to prevent a ‘hot war’ in the future.”

-- A U.S. drone strike killed civilians, Afghan officials claimed. From the Times: “An American drone strike on a car carrying a woman who had just given birth in southeastern Afghanistan left five people dead, including the mother, three of her relatives and the driver, Afghan officials and family members said on Sunday. The strike in the Alisher District of Khost Province occurred either late Friday night or early Saturday, they said. The woman, Malana, 25, had given birth to a son, her second child, at home. But her health had deteriorated soon after and relatives had been taking her to a clinic. On their way home, their vehicle was hit. After the strike, there was confusion about whether the newborn was among the victims. Later, it became clear that the baby had not been in the car. Turab Khan, a relative, said the boy was safe at home.”

-- Gunmen in Burkina Faso massacred 14 Christians during a church service. Danielle Paquette reports: “Sunday’s massacre follows a string of attacks by radical Islamist insurgents on military posts, a mining convoy and places of worship in the restive countryside that the cash-strapped military has struggled to contain. The assailants fled on motorbikes after spraying bullets into the Protestant congregation, authorities said. … No group has asserted responsibility for the attack yet, but fighters linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda routinely ambush soldiers and civilians in a campaign to sow division, gain recruits and seize territory. … The church ambush in Hantoukoura follows attacks on places of worship that have killed dozens this year in the country’s borderlands. … The gunfire is often indiscriminate, analysts say, but extremists have targeted men for wearing crosses and Muslim leaders who do not follow their rules.”

-- Political leaders and diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks, starting today, for talks on climate change. From the BBC: The meeting “was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. … This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but [Trump] will not be among them. However, [Nancy Pelosi] will attend the conference with a congressional delegation.""

Kamala Harris should have been a contender. In the summer of 2017, the California senator was the toast of the Hamptons and new queen of the Clintonites. From the earliest days of her candidacy, Harris boasted the enthusiastic support of Hillary’s donor network and supporters, warm relations with Obamaworld, and the sympathies of a broad range of Democratic lawmakers in the nation’s largest state and beyond. When Harris withdrew from the race Tuesday, she was second only to Joe Biden in FiveThirtyEight’s “endorsement primary.”

If America’s political parties were still strong enough to anoint their own standard-bearers in smoke-filled rooms (and/or wine-soaked patios), Harris would be on her way to a presidential nomination. Instead, she’s cutting her losses and fortifying her defenses against a hypothetical primary challenge in 2022.

The Democratic Establishment may finally be reconciling itself to Joe Biden. But the former vice-president had to maintain a large lead over the field for months before his party’s donors began moving sharply his way. And even now, significant factions refuse to accept that a 77-year-old white guy who’s rambly beyond his years is their best bet for fending off the Democratic left (thus, we all now know the name of the mayor of South Bend). One reason why Barack Obama tapped Biden as his running mate in the first place was that he was looking for a wingman, not an heir apparent — and the idea of Uncle Joe running for the presidency at age 74 appeared self-evidently absurd. The party’s Pooh-Bahs may settle for an even older Biden, but only if the rank and file leaves them no other choice.

Harris was the one they wanted. She offered oratorical talent, a national political identity still inchoate enough to be remodeled to the demands of the moment, and an opportunity to make history. She appeared progressive enough to appease the left, and pragmatic enough to ease the corporate wing’s economic anxieties. But none of that mattered much, in the end.

Multiple suspects are implicated in Kamala 2020’s premature death. The autopsies began while its heart was still beating: Over the weekend, the New York Times curated the mutual recriminations of her campaign’s warring factions. Whoever was truly at fault, there appears to be little disagreement that her operation was poorly managed. But the Harris team’s idiosyncratic failings can’t explain why Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and other conventionally qualified Democratic candidates have been polling behind her. A separate explanation for Harris’s woes is that, in the Trump era, Democratic voters have developed a more conservative conception of electability than the party’s elites. After the trauma of 2016, perhaps many primary goers feel that nominating an African-American or a woman — let alone an African-American woman — would be tempting fate. But while there is almost certainly some truth to this assessment, it also cannot explain why the two candidates who most violently defy the conventional wisdom about “electability” — the Jewish socialist Bernie Sanders, and female anti-corporate crusader Elizabeth Warren — remain poised to compete in Iowa and beyond.

Thus, Harris’s improbable collapse, along with the failure of Booker or Klobuchar to ever launch, seems indicative of something larger than their individual liabilities — namely, the weakness of modern American political parties as institutions. Booker has won more coveted endorsements than Bernie Sanders, and Klobuchar has claimed more than Pete Buttigieg. But each has mustered only a small fraction of the socialist senator’s or South Bend mayor’s support. Harris’s fundamental problem was that her campaign was rich in a depreciating currency. What looked like the potency of Establishment signaling in 2016 may have actually been the power of mere familiarity: Democratic base voters tend to admire the party’s most prominent leaders, and many are happy to default to a familiar face. For this reason, Biden has managed to coast on name recognition and goodwill. But Establishment support without national renown doesn’t seem to count for much.

In the land of weak parties, mass media is king. Politics Twitter may be wildly unrepresentative of the Democratic electorate. And Harris’s campaign may have erred by failing to appreciate that fact. But her candidacy’s demise reveals that catering to the tastes of the Twitter left is nevertheless perfectly rational. Those bundlers in the Hamptons failed to provide Harris with a steady supply of campaign cash. Sanders’s and Warren’s ideologically motivated, extremely online small-dollar armies by contrast have kept their coffers full. Meanwhile, Buttigieg got off the ground by accepting — and “acing” — absolutely every earned media opportunity that came his way. And in the past week, Michael Bloomberg managed to buy himself the same level of national support as Harris by dropping a recording-breaking $30 million on television ads. In many respects, Donald Trump’s 2016 triumph may prove sui generis. But in demonstrating that media dominance can compensate for a total dearth of intraparty support, the mogul’s first campaign gave us a preview of the new normal.

All of which is to say, the main lesson of Harris’s failure may be this: If you enter a presidential race without celebrity status, unique credibility among your party’s most engaged and ideological activists, billions of dollars in personal wealth, or a preternatural gift for charming white journalists and Iowa grandparents, you are going to have a hard time keeping your campaign funded — no matter how warmly you’re celebrated on Capitol Hill or Martha’s Vineyard."

When Joe Biden turned up in Iowa over the weekend on a tour bus with the words “No Malarkey” splashed across the side, he was sending a message to caucusgoers and his Democratic rivals: No more Mr. Nice Joe.

On Monday the gloves came off, with Biden taking swipes at Pete Buttigieg, his main competition for the moderate vote in Iowa and the beneficiary of a recent surge in support, and Elizabeth Warren, who has dropped in polling but remains strong in the state.

According to Bloomberg News, the former VP invited reporters into the no malarkey zone for an unfiltered question-and-answer session that included Biden accusing Buttigieg of copying his health-care plan, which is centered on creating a public option for anyone who wants it. “He stole it,” Biden said. He also accused reporters of going easy on the South Bend mayor. Biden said that if he had put out a health-care plan that so closely resembled an opponent’s, the press would have “torn my ears off.” He added: “I’d be a plagiarizing no good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.” Biden, of course, has been accused of plagiarism before.

Biden also said Buttigieg “doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderates.” But if Biden’s right about that, it’s hard to imagine why the front-runner would be publicly bashing the 37-year-old Hoosier. Buttigieg has positioned himself as an alternative to Biden for voters who see Warren and Bernie Sanders as too far left, and despite Biden’s protests, moderates in Iowa seem to be buying it.

Biden also hit Warren for a lack of “enthusiasm” in Iowa, Bloomberg News reports:

“You don’t see that with Warren. Stop kidding a kidder. OK, come on, man, give me a break,” Biden said of the Massachusetts senator, who’s drawing large crowds, though she’s fallen from her highs in state and national polls. “Look at the polling everywhere. OK. Tell me. Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself.”

Clearly Biden’s not just done with malarkey. He’s got no time for flimflam, poppycock, or balderdash either."

A cosmopolitan elite is eroding the integrity of America’s borders and the sovereignty of its citizens. This numerically small but economically powerful band of globe-trotters use their outsize political influence to preempt popular policies that they don’t like — or else, sabotage the enforcement of those they can’t block. The resulting lawlessness and illicit cross-border flows beggar middle-class taxpayers and strain the finances of our welfare state. And everyone who dares to object to this state of affairs — or to demand a crackdown on those who flout our nation’s laws and make a mockery of its claims to self-governance — are derided as naïve, know-nothing demagogues or worse.

You’ve heard this story before. Donald Trump and his allies have deployed variations on it to demonize undocumented immigrants, and cast their xenophobic movement as a populist, majoritarian cause whose only real opposition is a cabal of unpatriotic elites. And yet, virtually all of the right’s (non-explicitly white nationalist) complaints about our government’s failure to enact and enforce restrictions on internationally mobile labor ring far truer when applied to internationally mobile capital.

This reality is reflected in the current debate over wealth taxes. Critics of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders’s schemes for soaking the superrich have martialed a variety of arguments against them. But the most prominent is an appeal to fatalism: Even if annual levies on great fortunes or confiscatory top income-tax rates were desirable, the U.S. government would remain incapable of effectively enforcing them. A wide variety of economists and billionaires have offered versions of this warning. “You finally have some politicians who are so extreme that I’d say, ‘No, that’s even beyond,’” Bill Gates recently said, qualifying his support for stiffer taxes on his class. “You do start to create tax-dodging and disincentives, and an incentive to have the income show up in other countries and things.”

This argument asks Americans to accept a stark limitation on their nation’s sovereignty. It stipulates that in a world of globally mobile capital, the effective limit on top tax rates is set by our superrich, not our democratic polity. Why this diminution of the nation-state’s authority should be acceptable — even as a minuscule amount of undocumented immigration is regarded as a crisis of the rule of law — is difficult to explain.

There have been times in American history when immigration restriction was a popular cause. But we’re not living in one. According to Gallup’s most recent polling, only 27 percent of Americans believe that immigration levels should be reduced. By contrast, Elizabeth Warren’s plan to levy a 2 percent wealth tax on households worth over $50 million commands 61 percent approval in Politico-Morning Consult’s polling, with a large plurality of Republicans endorsing the idea. Public support for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 70-percent top marginal tax rate is similarly robust. And yet, such steeply progressive tax policies are widely considered politically untenable and logistically unenforceable — largely because of the outsize political influence (and innovative unlawfulness) of the cosmopolitan elites who bankroll the Republican Party.

The costs of our government’s inability to police every inch of our 1,933-mile border with Mexico — and thus, perfectly enforce our legal restrictions on labor mobility — are miniscule if not nonexistent. Far from burdening middle-class taxpayers and straining the welfare state’s capacity, undocumented immigrants contribute an estimated $13 billion to Social Security and $3 billion to Medicare each year, despite their ineligibility for those programs’ benefits. Meanwhile, America’s undocumented population also increases our nation’s productive capacity, and thus, the size of the economic pie that can be diverted to publicly beneficial ends. These facts, combined with the undocumenteds’ greater propensity for abiding by our nation’s laws, means that the imperfections in our immigration enforcement system have gifted our country a lower crime rate, higher economic growth, and a smaller federal deficit.

By contrast, the costs of Uncle Sam’s failure to enforce existing taxes on the rich (let alone, to enact rates commensurate with popular preferences) have been exorbitant. By the IRS’s estimates, tax evasion costs the federal government roughly $450 billion in lost revenue every year. Much of this is achieved through underreporting, but a good chunk is attributable to the illicit movement of wealth across borders. Globally, upwards of $6 trillion in untaxed earnings are stowed away in tax havens, according to the estimates of economist Gabriel Zucman, a leading authority on the subject.

The one percent’s refusal to abide by our nation’s tax laws is all the more remarkable given how much influence they’ve exercised over their content. For decades, a large majority of the American public has said that taxes on the rich are too low. And yet, policymakers have bucked that consensus, with Republican administrations reducing the tax burdens of the rich by far more than their Democratic successors have increased them. In 1980, America’s wealthiest 400 families paid an average effective tax rate of 47 percent; today, that figure is 23 percent, which is slightly lower than the average rate paid by those in the bottom half of America’s income ladder.

The dollar’s privileged status as the global reserve currency, combined with persistently low interest rates, has mitigated the consequences of our inability to subject the superrich to progressive taxation: Instead of fully offsetting the costs of tax breaks for billionaires with cuts to social spending, Uncle Sam has been free to run higher and higher deficits. But demagogy about the national debt has still forced bouts of austerity and persistent underinvestment in social programs and infrastructure that would benefit ordinary Americans. Meanwhile, in the absence of robust federal funding for various state-level programs, many states have steadily increased taxes on their poor.

In sum: Just about everything conservatives say about immigration policy and enforcement in the U.S. applies with much greater force to tax policy and enforcement. Our inability to hold internationally mobile capitalists accountable to our lenient tax laws undermines one of the most basic aspects of national sovereignty — the freedom to democratically determine our polity’s distribution of economic rights and responsibilities — and does so in a manner that materially harms ordinary Americans.

Happily, a few on the right are beginning to understand this. The latest issue of American Affairs — a policy journal founded by a Trump supporter who wished to add some intellectual sinew to the skeletal frame of the mogul’s nationalist ideology — features an excellent meditation on “Tax Sovereignty in the Age of Global Capital.” In the essay, Michael Cuenco, a graduate student at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, articulates some of the arguments I’ve outlined above, while endorsing a far more sophisticated conception of national sovereignty than one is used to encountering in a conservative publication. Drawing on the work of the political philosopher and economist Peter Dietsch, Cuenco argues that the “Westphalian concept of national sovereignty” — defined by the illegitimacy of one state interfering in another’s internal affairs — has become outmoded in an age of footloose capital:

In an economically interdependent world, the extremes of tax competition and the absence or relative weakness of tax cooperation mean that, as countries “struggle to preserve their Westphalian sovereignty” through strategic attempts at attracting and retaining globally mobile capital, “arbitrage becomes possible and the erosion of [fiscal self-determination through low fiscal flexibility and regressive pressures on public finance] results.” Dietsch proposes that, as things are, “Westphalian sovereignty is no longer adequate, or even logically possible. If the policies of [one state] affect other states in ways that, although not directly exercising authority over their policies, nevertheless indirectly undermine the effectiveness of these policies, then Westphalian sovereignty is compromised.” Furthermore, the continuing rise in capital mobility might necessitate new forms of institutional cooperation between states that could further conflict with the ideal of Westphalian sovereignty.

Dietsch makes a comparison with individual liberty and appeals to “the idea that sovereignty, just as much as liberty, entails not only rights but obligations” … Dietsch is thus able to formulate “tax sovereignty” as having a “twofold conditional nature,” consisting of a state’s right to fiscal self-determination bundled with a “responsibility to respect” the fiscal self‑determination of other states.

In other words: Safeguarding America’s national sovereignty and building effective institutions of global governance are not conflicting objectives; the second is a precondition for the first. In the absence of an international system for monitoring and policing cross-border capital flows, no nation can exercise genuine sovereignty over its own fiscal policy.

Fortunately, constructing such a system is well within our collective capacity. In fact, we’ve already broken ground on the project. As Cuenco notes:

One need look no further than the United States, which is already far ahead in getting other nations to respect its fiscal self-determination. In 2010, the United States unilaterally imposed the Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (fatca) that requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to submit the financial accounts information of American citizens and resident taxpayers to the Internal Revenue Service, with the threat of a 30 percent withholding tax on U.S. source income to be imposed on FFIs that fail to comply. This historic piece of legislation and its global consequences serve as a concrete example of a state demanding that other states recognize its sovereign right to collect revenue from its tax base, albeit in a rather heavy-handed way, by compelling foreign actors to provide assistance to its revenue agency. More could be done to improve fatca, but it’s a start … One can envision a near future where sovereign states are endowed with newfound fiscal capacities and powers of enforcement that would allow them to effectively track and tax the globally mobile segments of their tax base.

America’s power on the world stage may be in decline. But between our coveted consumer and financial markets, and military supremacy, we retain a lot of leverage over how global commerce is conducted. If a Sanders or Warren administration chose to make the restoration of fiscal sovereignty a top-tier priority of its foreign policy, the superrich’s taxable assets would have nowhere to hide (or, at least, fewer places to hide). Some of the logistical challenges of wealth taxation might persist. But the ceiling on how much revenue our government could realistically extract from the tiny fraction of its citizens who’ve been hoarding the gains of economic growth would rise meteorically.

To this point, progressives have largely framed their tax plans as measures for combating inequality and advancing economic justice. And these are surely potent themes. But truly comprehensive tax reform — and the revamped enforcement apparatus it would entail — would also represent a reassertion of the rule of law, and the sovereignty of our nation-state. Trump’s Republican Party, meanwhile, exists to subordinate such sovereignty to the whims of its globe-trotting benefactors. Sanders and Warren might be wise to point that out."

Tom Steyer’s presidential campaign wasn’t born on third base. Unlike some other Democratic candidates, the humble hedge-fund manager didn’t enter the 2020 race with national name recognition, his own journalistic empire, or a multibillion-dollar personal fortune. In fact, Steyer’s wealthiest intraparty rival could afford to buy up every last thing he owns more than 30 times over.

And yet, through hard work, determination, and $63 million in television ad buys, this salt-of-the-earth, single-digit billionaire has earned his place on the Democratic debate stage in December, while Michael “Moneybags” Bloomberg has not.

To qualify for Blue America’s next oratorical smackdown in Los Angeles, candidates had to either hit 4 percent in four national polls approved by the DNC, or 6 percent in two early primary-state polls, while also securing campaign contributions from at least 200,000 donors. Steyer had already assembled the necessary polls before this week. And on Tuesday morning, his campaign announced that it had cleared the donor threshold.

Steyer is the seventh candidate to qualify for the December debate stage, where he will join Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. Other candidates have until December 12 to hit their marks.

Bloomberg, for his part, appears poised to outshine Steyer in their vote-buying contest. Last week, the megabillionaire (whose net worth is estimated at $54.6 billion, dwarfing Steyer’s piddling $1.6 billion) launched a $30 million ad blitz, the most expensive single week of campaign advertising in the history of presidential primaries.

Ads work, at least to a point.

In return, Bloomberg saw his support in national polls more than double to over 5 percent. Morning Consult’s tracking poll currently puts Bloomberg in a tie for fifth place with Kamala Harris; Steyer, meanwhile, is in a four-way tie for eighth with 2 percent support. But the former New York mayor has sworn off all campaign contributions, and is thus incapable of qualifying for any of the remaining Democratic debates, barring a change in the rules. And although Steyer is not registering much in national polls, in the early primary states — which he has inundated with paid messaging — Morning Consult has him at 9 percent, just three points behind Elizabeth Warren."

The 2020 Democratic presidential field, which added two candidates (Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg) last month, continued its natural “invisible primary” shrinkage as Montana governor Steve Bullock and former representative Joe Sestak withdrew from the race at the end of the Thanksgiving weekend.

Sestak left the contest as he entered it (very late, in June): as more or less an asterisk. He hoped his anti-Establishment persona and strong national-security record (he reached the rank of rear admiral in the Navy) would give him traction. But he raised very little money (under $400,000 in 2019, as of the third quarter), made no real mark in Iowa or other early states, and never threatened to make any debate stage. He came across as a figure from the past, less because of his two unsuccessful Senate campaigns in Pennsylvania than because of seeming like the relic of an era when Democrats pined incessantly for candidates with a military background.

Bullock, a sitting two-term governor from deep-red Montana with a reasonably progressive record, was a different matter. On paper, he had a strong electability argument in a cycle when Democratic voters were obsessed with electability, and as the presidential field first formed, he had some serious street cred. But he fatally alienated many insiders by refusing to enter the contest until his state’s legislative session ended in May. He missed the first debate in June, then had his one shot at a breakout moment in the July 30 debate in Detroit. As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti explained at the time, expectations for Bullock were high going into that event:

For months now — and, in some cases, years — a handful of senior Democrats have been whispering to donors, activists, strategists, and pundits that they should take a serious look at Montana governor Steve Bullock. Here’s a guy who’s actually won a statewide race deep in Trump Country, an anti-dark-money crusader with a solid liberal record, who could be the non–Joe Biden folksy sorta-centrist voters might be looking for, they said.

Unfortunately, the most memorable Bullock moment in that debate was his argument with Elizabeth Warren about her proposed no-first-use-of-nuclear-weapons position. Appearing determined to keep a preemptive U.S. nuclear strike on the table was not a great look for today’s Democratic Party:

[A]s the evening wound down, his exchange with Warren over nuclear policy highlighted the sheer scale of the task he still has ahead of him. And it reminded his advocates that this world probably isn’t the one of their wistful musings.

And it was John Delaney, not Bullock, who succeeded in hogging attention as the non-Biden-centrist in the race by going after Sanders and Warren repeatedly. That was the last time Bullock appeared in a candidate debate.

He managed to pull in $2.3 million in third-quarter fundraising, enough to run a couple of TV ads in Iowa, the main focus of his campaign. And for his fans there was one thrilling moment when an Emerson poll of that state in October showed him suddenly holding 4 percent of the vote (good for sixth place, ahead of such worthies as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker). But subsequent surveys were deeply discouraging, particularly the gold-standard Selzer poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom in November, which gave Bullock less than one-half of one percent alongside a pallid

24–26 favorability ratio. Whatever Bullock was selling, Iowa caucusgoers weren’t buying it.

One problem Bullock had among the party insiders who were his strongest constituency was the intense desire many harbored that in the end he would emulate John Hickenlooper by dropping out and instead running for the Senate (in his case, against Republican senator Steve Daines). Like Hickenlooper initially, Bullock has long maintained he’s not interested in becoming a senator, as Vox reported in August:

Bullock has repeatedly — and emphatically — said he doesn’t want the job.

Montana’s Senate seat “has never in his life, not once, been a consideration,” Bullock campaign senior adviser Matt McKenna told Vox. “There’s just no way.”

He repeated that demurral as he withdrew from the presidential contest. Buy cynics–or optimists, depending on how you look at it–will point out that Montana’s filing deadline for the Senate race isn’t until next March. Still, it’s more likely that Bullock will quietly end his term as governor next year and consider his options. He’s relatively young at 53. And if Democrats lose to Trump in 2020, Bullock will still be around, still possessing a sterling political record (if you overlook this misfired presidential bid) and his electability argument as his party sorts through the wreckage and looks for salvation."

Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist.

None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.

The emails show how, even at the state and local levels, lobbyists are trying to bend public opinion away from an idea that has seized much of the debate during the current Democratic presidential primary. Two candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), have proposed a massive redesign of the health-care system that would place all Americans on a single government health insurer.

AD

The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.

AD

The revelation comes amid a fierce debate among Democrats nationwide about the best way to address health-care concerns. Health care remains a top issue for many voters, and industry groups and moderate politicians have warned that the ideas pursued by Warren and Sanders could be viewed as too extreme and lead Democrats to lose in the 2020 election. But the ideas are also very popular among many Americans, and the health-care industry has taken notice.

The emails offer a glimpse into the industry mobilization against both single-payer and a “public option,"" a government-run insurer that would compete with private plans. A change could redirect trillions of dollars in spending, with insurers, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies all directly affected.

AD

The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future has spent more than $1 million on television advertisements since August warning against Medicare-for-all and other changes to the health-care system, according to Advertising Analytics, a firm that tracks TV spending. The Partnership has recently expanded its operations to the state level, and has heavily targeted voters in early primary states and battleground states, according to Politico.

AD

Neither of the consultants who helped write the op-eds would confirm or deny whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future.

MacDonald, asked whether he works for the organization, responded over the phone by saying: “Not directly. ... I probably need to talk to some other folks before I provide any details to you and see if I can have somebody call you back.” MacDonald said in a subsequent interview that he could not provide additional information about his clients.

AD

DeLand’s emails to the Ohio lawmaker’s staff include the acronym for the group in the subject line: “PAHCF op-ed - OH - Huffman[3]. docx.” DeLand did not return requests for comment about whether she had been hired by the group.

A spokesman for the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future declined to confirm or deny whether the group had hired MacDonald or DeLand. In emails to reporters, the partnership linked to op-eds written by these state lawmakers, at one point citing them as evidence that “voices throughout the nation” oppose Medicare-for-all.

AD

“It’s no surprise that elected officials on both sides of the aisle, and many other voices throughout the nation, are expressing serious concerns about these one-size-fits-all proposals” such as Medicare-for-all, Lauren Crawford Shaver, the Partnership’s executive director, said in a statement.

AD

Single-payer supporters say the lobbyists’ role in crafting the op-eds bolsters their argument that their opponents are parroting talking points from industry groups that profit off the current health-care system.

“These secret emails blow open what I saw firsthand and revealed as a health insurance whistleblower: These companies and their lobbyists will stoop to whatever it takes, no matter how grotesque, to deny people the lifesaving coverage they need,"" said Wendell Potter, a former health insurance executive who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. “This is just the latest reason we need to reform this broken system where greedy corporations determine who can get medical treatment in America.”

AD

The emails raise troubling ethical implications about the undisclosed involvement of private interests in lawmakers’ public statements, said Larry Noble, who served as general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center and the Federal Election Commission.

AD

“It’s disturbing,” Noble said. “I think there’s a certain ethical obligation to be upfront about who wrote the editorial.”

The emails appear to show extensive outside involvement in the Montana lawmakers’ op-eds. In a Microsoft Word document, MacDonald removed three paragraphs from a draft of Kelker’s op-ed that pointed out that the United States “clearly spends significantly more on health care per capita than other developed nations.” He also deleted a table from the lawmaker’s original draft showing that the United States has higher health-care spending per capita than France, Germany, Norway and Switzerland.

The columns were published this summer in the Missoulian, a newspaper published in Missoula, and the Billings Gazette.

AD

“I know most newspapers are going to have trouble formatting the graphic you provided and will likely ask us to hold off on that,” MacDonald told Kelker in a June 12 email. “The client had trepidations that it might also come across to the ‘less-discerning’ reader that because foreign single-payer markets cost patients less, they are superior.”

Instead, MacDonald wrote in the draft he sent back to Kelker that “extreme ends of the political spectrum"" are offering health-care proposals while “what most Montanans and Americans would prefer lies somewhere in the middle.” In his revisions, MacDonald also added a sentence that said, “Calls for a more government-controlled healthcare system are misguided as well.”

AD

In an interview, Kelker said it is common for state legislators to publish under their name op-eds that they did not write. “That’s pretty normal,"" she said. ""Actually, most of the time, for legislators, at least in Montana, [they] are written by someone else. You know, a helper-person, not necessarily a lobbyist. I normally write all of the text for my op-eds.”

AD

She added: “I suppose I’m fairly naive. … As a legislator, you learn to sort out who is a good guy, and who is not, in terms of the lobbyists, and [MacDonald] has always been really straight. I don’t hang out or do anything with lobbyists much, but I really do trust him.""

Gross, who acknowledged writing less than half of her op-ed, said that when she worked at Planned Parenthood, she frequently provided “templates” for young people who needed help drafting statements, adding that this practice occurs elsewhere, as well. Gross also said she listened to MacDonald’s description of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future and supported the group’s message.

AD

“Formally and informally, I have held the role of community/grassroots organizer for more than a decade. Providing letter-to-the-editor op-ed drafts/templates is a common practice in organizing work,” Gross said in a text message.

Gross also pointed to low pay for Montana lawmakers and noted that they do not have staff members.

She added: ""If I could do it over again, I would have spent more time on it and put it in my own words. But I was up against time constraints. ... If the angle is that a consultant wrote half of the op-ed that I had published in the Billings Gazette in July, so be it. I’m not embarrassed by that at all.”

Andrew Person (D), who served in the Montana state legislature until 2017, said in an interview that MacDonald also sent him a draft of an op-ed in June. The draft, reviewed by the Post, drew on Person’s background as a former aide to former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mt.), who helped write the Affordable Care Act.

Person said he did not think it was unethical for lawmakers to sign their name to an op-ed they did not write, but said: “It’s an important story because the public should be aware ... It has a definite impact on the public perception of the stand elected officials are taking on certain issues, and on certain issues you’re not going to be able to get a paid lobbyist to organize an effort like that.”

Person declined to put his name to the op-ed.

An aide to Ohio state Sen. Huffman confirmed that their office worked with the consultant on Huffman’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all as “socialized medicine” and “not a workable solution.” Asked whether that consultant had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, the aide responded, “I believe so.” Huffman’s office declined additional requests for comment.

John Fortney, a spokesman for the Ohio Senate Majority Caucus, later said in a statement: “The legislative process is open to input from everyone, including experts from [the] medical community. Senator Huffman is an emergency room doctor and understands the serious problems and affordability of the left’s misguided single payer agenda.”

Both Kelker and Gross said they received criticism from constituents about the views expressed in their op-eds. The day after Kelker’s op-ed ran, however, she wrote MacDonald an email that said: “At church, I received many favorable comments — mostly from Republicans!”"

The Republican Party lives off the largess of the welfare state’s worst enemies — and the votes of its primary beneficiaries. In 2016, Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump by more than 20 points with voters under 45. Absent the resilient Republicanism and superlative turnout rate of America’s seniors, the mogul would have lost the Electoral College in a landslide.

The president and his party become grown no less dependent on the outsize support of “gray America” in the years since. Trump’s disapproval rating among Americans under 35 hovers around 70 percent. Less than a third of millennials wanted Republicans to retain control of Congress last year. Meanwhile, in broader measures of generational opinion, both millennials and Gen-Zers evince higher levels of support for liberal ideological premises and policy proposals than any older cohorts. And these aberrantly socialist generations will represent a larger share of the electorate with each passing cycle; in 2018, millennial, Gen-Z, and Gen-X voters collectively cast more ballots than their elders for the first time ever in a midterm election.

Thus the GOP appears poised to grow increasingly reliant on the support of older voters, even as those voters grow evermore dependent on on social-welfare programs: In the coming decades, millions of younger boomers will age into eligibility for Medicare and Social Security, while millions of older ones will develop a need for long-term care. Whether the GOP can keep these graying boomers satisfied — while meeting its obligations to the anarcho-capitalist billionaires who are the party’s top shareholders (and the movement conservative ideologues who are its top functionaries) — may determine its electoral viability in 2020 and beyond.

To this point, the GOP has managed to finesse its internal contradictions by slow-walking its ambitions for Medicare and Social Security, portraying all other transfer programs as a threat to older Americans’ hard-earned benefits, and/or baldly lying about where the two parties actually stood on entitlements. In 2012, Paul Ryan excoriated the Obama administration for its (nonexistent) cuts to Medicare benefits. Four years later, Trump campaigned on a promise to oppose all cuts to entitlement spending. This mendacious messaging, combined with the Democratic Party’s own flirtations with “entitlement reform,” helped to decrease the salience of seniors’ favorite socialist programs in national elections.

Fortunately, the Democratic Party is no longer locked in a (figurative) ménage à trois with “Simpson and Bowles.” Now, instead of promising Grand Bargains on the deficit, or the mere maintenance of existing entitlements, Democrats are pushing to expand benefits for America’s seniors (which is the one proposal for welfare-state expansion that Republicans can’t paint as a threat to seniors’ benefits). All of the leading contenders for the party’s 2020 nomination have endorsed increasing Social Security benefits. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, have endorsed “universal long-term care” as part of their proposals for health-care reform. And last week, Pete Buttigieg unveiled his “Gray New Deal” — a package of new benefits for seniors that includes an expansion of Social Security, a “Public Option 401(k),” and a means-tested entitlement to long-term care.

The Democrats’ leftward lurch on socialism for seniors is right on the merits: Owing in part to gains in life expectancy among the elderly, an American turning 65 today has somewhere between a 50 and 70 percent chance of eventually requiring long-term support by the end of his or her life. And yet, the U.S. is nearly alone among wealthy nations in lacking a universal long-term-care benefit. What’s more, as James Medlock and Colin McAuliffe of Data for Progress note, the U.S. spends far less on long-term care (as a percentage of its GDP) than the vast majority of OECD countries.

If the federal government does not step in and provide more funding for home health-care workers and quality live-in facilities, then millions of older Americans will be at risk of spending their “golden years” in conditions of harrowing deprivation, while millions of younger Americans will see their own ambitions compromised by the burdens of caring for their elders.

But even if expanding social support for the elderly weren’t good policy, it would remain indispensably good politics. Increasing Social Security benefits and creating a new entitlement to long-term care are both overwhelmingly popular. In a recent survey, Tufts University and Data for Progress (DFP) told respondents, “Some Democrats have proposed spending $120 billion per year to provide seniors with comprehensive long-term-care benefits through Medicare” and that this policy would require raising payroll taxes by 1.5 percent and that Republicans say “American workers are already taxed too much and that increasing government spending is irresponsible.” The pollsters then asked respondents whether they supported the proposal. Remarkably, despite the explicit partisan framing and Republican counterargument, 60 percent of registered voters endorsed the proposal, while only 27 opposed it. What’s more, support for the plan was higher among boomers than among younger generations.

Support for expanding Social Security is even broader. A separate DFP poll of Warren’s plan for increasing Social Security benefits (by raising taxes on the rich) found 76 percent of respondents endorsing the idea, including 67 percent of Republican voters. Finally, a variety of proposals for aggressive government intervention to bring down pharmaceutical prices command supermajority support.

Conservatives have no politically viable rationale for rejecting these ideas. But they also have no ideological room to maneuver. Trump has tried his best to triangulate on prescription drugs. But Senate Republicans won’t let him. As Politico reported Sunday, most of McConnell’s caucus is refusing to embrace Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley’s milquetoast prescription-drug bill, on the grounds that some of its provisions amount to “government price controls.” In the estimation of the median Republican senator, conservatives are duty-bound to oppose “federal intervention when it comes to the cost of prescription drugs.” Such objections might have resonance at a meeting of the Federalist Society. But there simply is no mass constituency that takes more offense at the abstract concept of “price controls” than they do at price-gouging drug companies. (And, of course, Republicans do not actually oppose “federal intervention” in the prescription drug market; the high prices of prescription drugs in the U.S. derive from the unusual generosity of our nation’s government-granted patent monopolies, which GOP lawmakers are fighting tooth and nail to protect.)

The GOP’s helplessness in the face of a “Gray New Deal” is further confirmed by the Wall Street Journal editorial board’s takedown of Pete Buttigieg’s version of that agenda. The paper lambastes Mayor Pete for trying to buy seniors’ votes and warns its readers that his plan would require raising taxes on “all high-income” Americans “from $250,000 to infinity.” This attack line may play well with the 2 percent of the voting-eligible public that earns more than a quarter-million dollars a year. But it’s unlikely to strike a chord with the median elderly voter.

America is in dire need of a wide variety of progressive reforms. And there are strong arguments against prioritizing new benefits for seniors over action on climate change or health care or voting rights, when and if Democrats retake the White House and Senate. But before worrying about exactly how they should wield power, progressives will first need to win it. And in both the primary and general elections, left-wing candidates have both an urgent need to increase their support among seniors and more to offer those voters than any of their rivals. Americans who cannot support themselves on market income — and are in acute need for affordable drugs and medical service — have no better friend than the progressive movement and no worse enemy than the Republican Party. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren should do everything they can to make older Democratic primary voters see that. And next fall, the Democratic Party should do everything in its power to make the 2020 election into a referendum on a “Gray New Deal.”"

At first glance, Michael Bloomberg’s campaign for the Democratic nomination looked like the answer to a question no one asked.

Perhaps a few Democratic-primary voters were pining for a corporate-friendly centrist who lacked Joe Biden’s appeal to nonwhite people and one-upped his baggage on issues of racial justice, financial regulation, entitlement spending, and sexual harassment. But while this constituency may be large enough to fully staff a “Conscious Capitalism” panel at Davos, it seems far too small to supply the billionaire with a plurality of Democratic delegates.

It’s now clear, however, that Bloomberg is casting a wider net. In a recent interview with PBS — which recirculated on social media on Sunday — the former New York mayor signaled that he intends to run in the “unrepentant Stalinist” lane of the Democratic primary. Asked by Firing Line’s Margaret Hoover about how the U.S. can get China and India to be good partners in the fight against climate change, Bloomberg argued that the Chinese Communist Party was ecologically friendly, democratically accountable, and invulnerable to the threat of revolution.

Bloomberg: China is doing a lot. Yes, they’re still building a lot of coal-fired power plants.

Hoover: And they’re still burning coal.

Bloomberg: Yes, they are, but they’re now moving plants away from the cities. The Communisty Party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public. When the public says I can’t breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator; he has to satisfy his constituents or he’s not going to survive.

Hoover: He’s not a dictator?

Bloomberg: No, he has a constituency to answer to.

Hoover: He doesn’t have a vote. He doesn’t have a democracy. He’s not held accountable by voters.

Bloomberg: If his advisers gave him —

Hoover: Is the check on him just a revolution?

Bloomber﻿g: You’re not going to have a revolution. No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.

Bloomberg’s views here stand in stark contrast to those of Bernie Sanders. Although some centrist pundits have declared the Vermont senator a proto-authoritarian leftist, Sanders’s own rhetoric belies that title. The self-avowed “socialist” has cast Xi’s China as the leader of an “international authoritarian axis,” one that has been “clamping down on domestic political freedom while it aggressively promotes a version of authoritarian capitalism abroad.” Sanders’s broadsides against Chinese communism have led some on the left to decry him as a bourgeois deviationist and imperialist dog. Thus Bloomberg’s apparent aim is to assemble a motley coalition of penthouse-owning executives with a financial interest in appeasing Beijing and basement-dwelling “tankies” with an ideological investment in Xi Jinping Thought.

Okay: Michael Bloomberg is probably not making a conscious play for the “kratom-track” Maoist vote in South Carolina. But it is remarkable how much the patron saint of neoliberal paternalism’s views on China overlap with those of “tankie” Twitter. It’s hard to imagine that a figure like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could have argued that Xi is not a dictator — and that the Chinese Communist Party is accountable to majoritarian opinion — without suffering broad bipartisan condemnation. Yet Bloomberg’s remarks in September prompted few calumnious columns on the authoritarianism of the anti-populist center. Which is unfortunate, since the U.S. business community’s interests in Beijing make this political tendency a genuine threat.

As a substantive matter, Bloomberg does have a small kernel of a point: The Chinese government does not rule by brute force alone, enjoys significant popular support, and has demonstrated a concern with responding to certain forms of public disaffection — including complaints about air quality in the nation’s primary cities. But it is unclear why Bloomberg thinks “They’re now moving [coal] plants away from the cities” qualifies as evidence of China’s commitment to combating climate change. If a coal plant spews C02 in the middle of a forest and no one (with political power) is around to complain about it, it still makes Earth warmer. Even if we accept that Xi is accountable to public opinion, it does not follow that his government will pursue sustainable development. Nations with formal mechanisms of democratic accountability have been almost universally shirking their obligations under the Paris accords. Meanwhile, China’s supposed responsiveness to popular concerns about pollution has coincided with regressive changes in its overall energy policy. Since 2017, Beijing’s annual investment in clean energy has fallen from $76 billion to $29 billion. In the coming years, it plans to add about as much new coal-power capacity as currently exists in the entire European Union.

So Bloomberg’s initial answer is a non sequitur at best, and his subsequent ruminations on the character of Xi’s regime are something worse. In a nation where critical speech is censored (if not criminally punished) and the public is inundated with state propaganda, what does “the will of the majority” mean exactly? And if an authoritarian ruler enjoys the approval of 51 percent of the population, does that mean he cannot be a “dictator,” no matter what he does to disenfranchised minority groups? And if “no government survives without the will of the majority of its people,” does that mean most residents of apartheid South Africa approved the ruling regime right up until the early 1990s, when black opinion in the country suddenly changed?

It may be difficult to discern the logic of Bloomberg’s apologia for Xi. But it’s quite easy to posit a logical reason for Bloomberg to spew illogical apologies for the Communist Party: The billionaire has vast financial interests in China, and those interests have allegedly compromised his civic-minded endeavors in the past. In 2013, the New York Times reported that Bloomberg News had killed an investigation that had threatened to upset Chinese officials.

Donald Trump has tried to paint his Democratic opponents as cosseted coastal elites who are in bed with China, exert undue influence over the mainstream media, and want to tell working-class Americans how to live. If Democrats somehow nominate Bloomberg, Trump’s ideal foil will be made of money instead of straw."

MARION, Iowa — “We're going to try something different,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Sunday night. “You all are my experimental group.”

That got some laughter from the crowd, 350 or so Iowans out to see a candidate whose “front-runner” status had evaporated sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving. Warren was serious. Out was the finely crafted stump speech, with reminiscences of her mother putting on her Sunday best (“you all know the dress”) and working to save her family. Out were the applause lines about how “unions will rebuild the middle class” and how the Supreme Court should follow “basic standards of ethics.”

Instead, Warren talked for a fast eight minutes, then took questions for an hour — impeachment, Medicare-for-all, impeachment again, and whether there was a moment in her life “where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn't accept you as much.” After steadily losing support to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren was working to remind Iowans why they'd liked her in the first place: She was the candidate with plans. Remember that?

The Marion town hall, followed by an event in Iowa City where she continued the ask-anything format, was Warren's way of acknowledging that something had gone wrong. She would never say so outright. Warren's campaign has avoided talk about the horse race or its plan of attack, even in better days.

Over the summer, when an Iowa poll found Warren leading for the first time, her campaign told staff not to talk about it, and they obliged, a dogma that continued through the year. Reporters who get time with Warren, usually in short gaggles after her town halls, have learned that any horse race question will get a happy non-answer about why the senator is “in this fight” or why she isn't paying attention to polls.

“No,” Warren told reporters in Iowa City, when asked whether she was adjusting her campaign after a downswing. “This is a chance to just talk to more people, and hear their questions, and field more questions. I've been fielding questions since the very first event I did right at the beginning in Iowa.”

It's true that Warren has done this before; it's also true that she's shaking things up. As it rose, Warren's campaign refused to engage with most negative attacks, not even dispatching surrogates for cable TV segments. Warren herself avoided TV interviews, ignored Sunday talk shows and seldom responded to the (often-Trump-centric) news of the day.

There are signs of change, with Warren expected to sit for several cable interviews this week and top surrogates such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts expected to do more TV work as the impeachment drama continues. The Marion town hall produced one of Warren's first viral moments in weeks, when she comforted a member of the LGBTQ community with an emotional story about her divorce.

That was new. Warren's media strategy until Marion had come with disadvantages, exacerbated by her support for Medicare-for-all, which she opted to defend conceptually and funded with a complicated mix of tax increases on the wealthy and employers. Four years earlier, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) challenged Hillary Clinton from the left, not a single negative ad ran in Iowa about his health-care plan, and Sanders did not release an outline for Medicare-for-all until two weeks before the caucuses. This year, attacks on the least popular aspect of Medicare-for-all began six months before anyone would vote.

Over the summer, the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of insurers, bought half of all political advertising in Iowa. As the leaves changed, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado both began running ads that emphasized how they would expand government insurance coverage without touching private insurance — unlike Warren, or Sanders. The ads did not mention specific candidates, but the splashback hit Warren, who did not counterpunch unless directly attacked.

In mid-November, Warren partially broke with Sanders with her own transition plan, which would delay the end of private insurance. The attacks didn't stop, and the battle did damage that the campaign knew it needed to reverse. In Marion, she packed her plan for Medicare into three tight minutes: using executive powers to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, using budget reconciliation to lower the enrollment age and pull millions of people into the system, then teeing up a battle with weakened insurance companies.

“I think America is going to say: I'm on board, I get it, I like how this works,” Warren said. “I think that is how we're going to get the most help early in the process, and we're going to be able to open it up. So, it's not about fighting among Americans; it's about how to get health care to every single American at the lowest possible cost.”

One word in that answer — “fighting” — got to Warren's problem. Until her opponents zeroed in on Medicare-for-all, Warren was most strongly identified with her plan for an incremental wealth tax (“two cents, two cents”) that paid for an expansive liberal agenda without asking the vast majority of Americans to pay more. Instead of arguing with any primary opponents, Warren was arguing with billionaires, which she relished. In October and November, she was arguing with fellow Democrats, which she didn't, and Buttigieg flourished by both criticizing Warren's tone and by promising not to get wrapped up in “fighting.”

That has pulled voters away from Warren, sometimes visibly; there were empty seats in a Sunday afternoon event in Waterloo, which drew 175 people in a reliably Democratic town. (Terrance Hollingsworth, who'd organized a summer house party for Warren, said she shouldn't have come to the black part of Waterloo while many voters were at church.) Warren had kicked off the weekend with a rally of around 3,000 supporters in Chicago, which quieted the talk of a fade-out.

Warren's voters were paying attention to the setbacks. At Sunday's events, some used words such as “uncomfortable” to describe how Warren had handled attacks on her policies, though some added that they wanted to see a woman in the White House. (The surprise exit from the race by Sen. Kamala D. Harris has increased the chance that Warren would be the last woman standing in Iowa.) In Waterloo, Ken and Mary Huffman, both 69, were divided — Ken was all in on Warren, while Mary had been dismayed by the Medicare conversation.

“I like what Buttigieg is saying, especially his Medicare for those who want it,” said Mary Huffman. “I've read that there are concerns about whether her plan is enough to pay for that.” Warren's eventual payment and transition plans, she said, had “swayed” her, but not enough to pick a side of the fence.

It's Buttigieg, not Sanders, who Warren-world sees as her biggest problem in Iowa. The Sanders campaign shares that theory, seeing no threat to itself from Buttigieg's more comfortable, college-educated and white coalition, in Iowa or elsewhere. Warren's campaign, with eight weeks to turn things around, is watching to see whether Buttigieg can hold up to scrutiny; while that happens, it's working to restore the image Warren had over the summer as the candidate who could plan for anything and answer any question. It wouldn't abandon the “fight” framing, even as Buttigieg seemed to gain by attacking it.

“It is easy to give up on big ideas,” Warren said. “It makes you sound smart and sophisticated: Just give up on the big ideas! But when we give up on the big ideas, we give up on the people who would be touched by those ideas. Most people are already in a fight.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who ended her campaign for the presidency Tuesday, was not like other Democrats who'd dropped out. She had 15 endorsements from members of Congress — 16, before the resignation of California's Katie Hill. She'd made inroads with local leaders and elected Democrats across early states. In two weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the loudest liberal voices in the party, was set to campaign for her in Iowa.

That seemed natural, more natural than the slow, brutal collapse of her campaign. At the start of this decade, when Elizabeth Warren was teaching at Harvard and Pete Buttigieg had just left McKinsey & Co., Harris was seen as a potential president, a “female Obama” whose Jamaican and Indian heritage made her intriguing to an increasingly diverse party.

What happened next was a classic political tragedy, a rise and rise and rise followed by a steep fall. Even Democrats who wanted to beat Harris had mixed feelings about what was happening. Harris was labeled a “cop” for a criminal justice record that was dissected for steps that angered activists (an anti-truancy policy that arrested parents, more than 1,000 marijuana convictions) while other moves (opposition to the death penalty that nearly cost her an election) were forgotten. Harris was the first of many Democrats to get whipsawed by the details of Medicare-for-all, and propose some changes to it, which hurt her in ways it never hurt Pete Buttigieg or Elizabeth Warren.

Even some of Harris's setbacks sat uneasily with some Democrats. Her problems began early, with an in-public struggle to define why she was running, and some high-profile events, such as She the People's summit in Houston and the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco, where she gave unmemorable answers or speeches.

But Harris had surged in the polls after criticizing Joe Biden's previous opposition to busing, which ended up showing how resilient Biden's black support really was — a problem for every one of his rivals. Her worst onstage moment came when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii unloaded on her California record, which turned Gabbard into a favorite of Republicans, encouraging her to go on the attack in later debates. (The Trump campaign quickly congratulated Gabbard after Harris's announcement; Gabbard herself tweeted that “while we disagree on some issues, we agree on others and I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people.”)

By November, Harris was not seen as a threat to the highest-polling Democrats, but her departure mattered in two big ways.

Harris had more legislative endorsements than any Democrat except Joe Biden, and more of them from nonwhite legislators. Those supporters, and some who were staying neutral to see whether Harris could recover, are now free agents, getting fresh overtures from rival campaigns. (One congressional endorser texted The Post about his plans with an emoji of a confused person shrugging.) Endorsements have not driven many votes in this primary, but Harris's included Rep. Barbara Lee, a leader of the party's left who once urged Bernie Sanders to run for president, and an army of local elected officials in California, where no Democrat has a clear advantage.

Harris was also the only nonwhite candidate who had qualified for December's debate in her home state, something that quickly dawned on activists and elected officials. The most diverse contest in presidential history, a race that once featured more women than men, had gotten very white. Two nonwhite Democrats are close to making the stage (Andrew Yang and, in a small irony, Tulsi Gabbard), but Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is not. Neither is former HUD secretary Julián Castro, who was cut from November's debate and was one of the first Democrats to defend Harris.

“The way that the media treated Senator Harris in this campaign has been something else,” Castro told CBS News reporter Tim Perry on Tuesday. “In the last few days, to see articles out of Politico, the New York Times, Washington Post, that have basically trashed her campaign and focused on just one small part of it, and I think held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate.”

Those articles had accurately conveyed the problems that ended Harris's campaign: muddled messaging, uncertain leadership and some scheduling errors that got noticed by activists and donors. But in the final weeks of her candidacy, Harris's stump speech had asked why nonwhite or female candidates were seen as less “electable” by voters still stunned by Donald Trump's 2016 win. Harris would tell voters that she was called unelectable in “every race that I have — here is the operative word — won.” On Tuesday afternoon, Democrats angry that the debate rules, demanding increasingly high poll numbers and donations for entry, had let the wealthy Tom Steyer onstage while excluding talented nonwhite candidates.

“That debate stage currently will not look like America,” said former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan.

“No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic,” said Leah Greenberg, the co-founder of the left-wing organizing group Indivisible. “We need leaders who represent the diversity of our party. The myth of 'electability' and the bias associated with it has done huge damage this cycle.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Amy Klobuchar, “Questions.” The senator from Minnesota's first spots in Iowa and New Hampshire portrayed her as a moderate who could unite the country and calm things down. Her new ad gets into one of the Democrats' most popular policies, using government power to flatten the costs of prescription drugs, without getting into the details. The message is more like the one typically deployed by populists: Drug companies get away with murder, sometimes literally, because no one stands up to them. “Why do drug companies make billions of dollars getting people hooked on opioids?” she asks. “The big pharmaceutical companies, they think they own Washington. Well, they don’t own me.”

Pete Buttigieg, “Welcomed Me.” The mayor's first South Carolina ad is the latest in a series that uses footage from his speech to the Liberty and Justice Celebration in Iowa. It recycles a Bible quote that other Democrats have used, but Buttigieg has really grabbed onto: “In our White House, you won’t have to shake your head and ask yourself, “Whatever happened to ‘I was hungry and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me?' ” There are more black voters pictured on-screen than in previous Buttigieg spots, but as part of a diverse mix.

2020

Kamala Harris wasn't the only Democrat to bow out of the Democratic race this week. On Monday, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced the end of his own campaign, saying in a statement that he “won’t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field.” To the consternation of Washington Democrats, who had urged him to forgo this race and run for Senate, he said he was seeking no other office.

Bullock had spent more than a year setting up a run, making stops in Iowa for local Democrats and fixating on a simple, consistent message: He’d won three elections in a red state, unlike literally everyone else running for president.

His biggest problem was that they actually started running for president, months before he did. Bullock, a Democrat presiding over a Republican legislature that meets for only a few months, spent the winter and spring of 2019 pushing through an extension of the state’s Medicaid expansion. When he declared his candidacy in May, he’d already missed out on months of organizing and fundraising.

Iowans did not seem care about that, and Bullock attracted sizable crowds in his first visits to the state. But he never broke through in a race in which Joe Biden, despite some stumbles, held onto a pile of moderate votes, and in which Pete Buttigieg had a head start, a compelling pitch — lighter on accomplishments, heavier on inspiration. Bullock’s one moment in the national spotlight, the second Democratic debate, was a missed opportunity, where he became part of a blur of low-polling candidates warning the party not to go far to the left.

Michael F. Bennet. He declared a sort of solidarity with Bullock after the governor ended his campaign, condemning DNC debate rules for leaving candidates like them (who have not reached the donor or polling thresholds) outside. “The fight to win back voters who abandoned our party for Donald Trump isn’t hopeless,” Bennet said. “It runs through battle-tested candidates from swing states, who know how to meet Americans where they are — not where the loudest voices on social media think they ought to be. It’s unfortunate that the DNC couldn’t make room for a perspective like that.”

Amy Klobuchar. She won over Iowa state Rep. Bruce Bearinger, who had previously endorsed Bullock.

Elizabeth Warren. She released a “fair workweek” plan, spelling out new labor rights for workers with variable schedules. Among the rules: requiring employers to give at least two weeks of notice on scheduling, family leave benefits for some part-time workers, and regulations that would prevent employers from taking advantage of those same part-time workers.

Joe Biden. He picked up the support of California Rep. Ami Bera, shortly before Harris left the race. (As noted above, that will free up a large number of California endorsers.)

Mike Bloomberg. He traveled to Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday for a criminal justice reform meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who has worked with Bernie Sanders but is neutral in the primary.

Cory Booker. He's returning to Iowa around this weekend's multiple cattle calls for an expansive “lead with love” tour.

Tom Steyer. He qualified for the December debate in Los Angeles by reaching more than 200,000 unique donations.

ON THE TRAIL

OKATIE, S.C. — On Sunday, in Iowa, Joe Biden told NBC News that he would not get into an argument with Pete Buttigieg. “Anything I say about Pete will be taken as maybe criticism or a negative about Pete,” Biden said. “I don’t have any negative feelings about Pete at all. I think he’s a talented guy.”

Twenty-four hours later, something changed. In an interview with the reporters following his ""No Malarkey"" tour, Biden scoffed at the idea that Buttigieg's ""Medicare for all who want it"" had caught on, saying he ""stole"" the plan from Biden's similar public option and Medicare buy-in.

“What would you have done to me? You would have torn my ears off,” Biden said. “I would be a plagiarizing, no-good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.”

Buttigieg, who has grappled with other Democrats, declined to spar with Biden. Speaking with reporters after a forum with Latino voters, Buttigieg said only that the former vice president was mistaken.

“I've been talking about Medicare for all who wanted since at least February,” Buttigieg said, “and also, the plans are not exactly the same. You know, we've got to focus on capping out-of-pocket costs and focus on a glide path that I think very well could lead to a Medicare-for-all environment. Of course, I believe that our approach on health care is the best one. And I'm willing to bring that plan out and compete with any of my competitors on having the best plan.”

Pressed again on what it meant that Biden went negative, Buttigieg said that it meant “that we've got an excellent plan.”

Biden's criticism stood out largely because it was new. The four highest-polling Democrats are now split, two and two, on whether America's mixed health-insurance system should be replaced by universal Medicare. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren favor replacement (one over four years, one only after Medicare is expanded to a near-universal program), and had scrapped with both Biden and Buttigieg. And Buttigieg still has more of an argument with the liberal senators; asked whether his plan would cover noncitizens, as Medicare-for-all does, he said it was more complicated.

“I do think that everybody should be eligible to buy in to Medicare for all who wanted the public plan,” Buttigieg said. “But I would expect that you'd have to be a citizen to qualify for subsidies.”

But she was never able to persuade significant numbers of voters to support her.

There are a number of reasons to which you could point to explain her difficulties. According to reports, her campaign was hampered by disorganization and mismanagement. Her fundraising couldn’t keep pace with that of other candidates such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She struggled with questions about her record as a prosecutor and her health-care plan (which was perfectly reasonable but didn’t slot neatly into the public option vs. Medicare-for-all conflict to which the debate is often reduced). It’s also hard to say whether her race and gender hurt her ability to amass support, and if so, how much.

One problem, though, stands out: As appealing as she may have been in many ways, Harris was never able to explain why she was running for president. It’s an answer you’d expect every candidate to know long before they make their announcement speech, but a surprising number of them don’t. The winner, though, almost always does.

Of course, we know that the real answer for every candidate, at least in part, is “I’m running for president because I want to be president.” If you think even highly ideological candidates such as Sanders aren’t fiercely ambitious, you’re fooling yourself.

But to stand the best chance at success, a presidential campaign has to be about something. Joe Biden is running to reset the clock to four years ago and restore civility and reason to our politics, his own version of “Make America Great Again.” Warren is running to end corruption and take power away from the plutocrats warping the system for their own ends. But why was Harris running? She never told us, at least not in a way that was clear and concise enough for voters to grasp.

To be clear, there are candidates still in the race who still haven’t told us. And as much as I hesitate to say they should pander to our ""10-second sound bite” culture, it’s not an unreasonable thing to demand that candidates should be able to communicate in a sentence or two what their candidacy represents. It’s particularly important during a primary when the policy distinctions between the candidates are relatively small compared with what they will be in the general election. Voters have to know who the candidates are, but they also have to know what voting for you says about them.

Like many, I’m sorry to see Harris leave the race (though she’ll be around for some time; she’s only 55). It’s particularly disconcerting that she was the only nonwhite candidate to have qualified for the next debate; an all-white debate is not exactly a good look for the party where most nonwhite voters reside.

Nor did it help that, while in person Bullock was warm, funny and quick, on TV he seemed stiff and awkward.

Finally, to a large extent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stole Bullock’s thunder on his top issue: trying to “rid our system of the corrupting influence of Dark Money,” as his written statement put it. Warren has launched a full-scale assault on corruption and a political system rigged in favor the rich and powerful. Whether in reference to a secret dinner for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the attempt to award the Group of Seven meeting to Trump’s own Doral property or the coziness of the Pentagon and the defense industry, Warren’s go-to phrase — “this is corruption, plain and simple” — helped her co-opt the issue.

As for the Montana governor’s future, Bullock reiterated Monday through a spokesperson that he will not run for the Montana Senate seat held by Republican Steve Daines. He should seriously rethink that position. He should consider not what he wants to do as a second act after he leaves the term-limited governorship, but what his party and country need him to do: help win control of the Senate.

Every issue he cares about, be it money in politics or trade or rural broadband or gun violence, will be impossible to address as long as Republicans, led by the self-proclaimed “Grim Reaper,” Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), retain the Senate majority. We have seen that no matter how many effective and urgently needed pieces of legislation the House passes (e.g., voting reform, guns, drug prices, nondiscrimination in employment for LGBTQ Americans), a Republican Senate can and will bury them. And the Senate has shown time and again it will rubber-stamp any Republican president’s executive or judicial branch nominee no matter how extreme or unqualified, while (as with Judge Merrick Garland) blocking consideration of a Democratic president’s nominees no matter how distinguished. Without the Senate majority, a Democratic president would be hobbled, and a (God forbid) second-term Trump would be free to populate the executive and judicial branches with more hacks and extremists.

As he likes to remind us, Bullock is the rare Democrat who can win in a red state that Trump carried by more than 20 points in 2016. If Bullock doesn’t run for Senate, Daines’s reelection is all but assured, and a potential pickup for Democrats is lost. With Bullock, Democrats’ chances to win the Senate improve immensely. (If they lose Alabama, they can still win the majority outright with Montana, Arizona, Colorado and Maine.)

Granted, the Senate is not a pleasant place these days. Any job that requires one to listen to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) drone on for hours (or days) at a time is not going to win awards for the best place to work in America. Nevertheless, what’s even less pleasant, and indeed downright scary, is living in a country in which Mitch McConnell controls the Senate, preventing any meaningful legislation from passing and enabling a lawless president and an intellectually and morally corrupt party to dominate our politics.

In his statement, Bullock declared, “On the difficult days, I would joke, ‘it’s worth the sacrifice because it’s only a fair shot at the American Dream and our representative democracy at stake.’ That truth remains.” Now he should prove his sincerity by running for Senate.

But while most of those who’ve dropped out over the course of the year were white men (including two already this week), Harris was both the best-polling nonwhite candidate and, for a brief moment this summer, someone who looked as if she might ascend to the top tier of the crowded field. That surge, following the first debate, soon faded, and Harris never regained her momentum.

There have been 27 major or major-adjacent candidates who’ve declared at some point. Fifteen of them remain, including the recent additions of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.

The debate criteria introduced by the Democratic Party have been effective at winnowing the field. While many of those still in the race haven’t been making the cut for recent debates, many of those who dropped out did so after failing to earn a debate slot.

But compare where we are now with what the field looked like on Valentine’s Day. At that point, most of those who had declared were women, black or Hispanic. Most of them are still in the race, even with Harris’s departure.

Now compare that with what the field looks like after Harris left.

Pay particular attention to that December debate column. It shows the six candidates who’ve earned a slot, all of whom are white. Harris had earned a slot but obviously won’t be participating following her departure from the race.

AD

AD

Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. Its strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.

It’s important to recognize, though, that this assessment of the collapse of diversity in the field overlooks two important factors.

The first is that we’re really only talking about racial and ethnic diversity. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will appear in December, as will candidates who would become the first Jewish (Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) or openly gay (South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg) presidents in U.S. history.

AD

AD

The second is that one reason that the field is narrowing to mostly white candidates is Democratic voters overwhelmingly support white candidates. The Post’s most recent primary poll, conducted with ABC News, showed that white candidates earned more than 80 percent of all support from Democratic primary voters, driven by the two-thirds eaten up by former vice president Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders. White men got just under 60 percent of all support.

Among nonwhite voters, white men got more support than among Democratic voters overall, albeit so slightly that the difference isn’t statistically significant. Even that is noteworthy, though: White and nonwhite voters support white and nonwhite candidates about equally.

At least when considered in demographic groups. Biden fares much better with black primary voters than do other candidates, one central reason he continues to lead the field.

AD

AD

As CNN’s Ronald Brownstein has noted, no candidate has been able to cobble together a coalition like the one enjoyed by Barack Obama in 2008. Biden’s doing well with black voters, Warren and Buttigieg are jostling for college-educated whites, and Sanders is performing well with younger voters. A broad split — but, again, all white.

As is often the case in American politics in 2019, President Trump plays a role here. Defeating Trump continues to be a primary motivation for Democratic primary voters, and white Democratic candidates continue to be seen — however justifiably — as the candidates with the best chance of winning in 2020. In our November poll, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the candidates most capable of beating Trump.

Perceptions of electability can change quickly. It did for Harris after her first debate performance, and it has for other candidates in the past. So far this year, though, Biden’s edge on electability has been consistent, even as electability has become a central concern of voters. That has been an ongoing problem for his opponents.

The other problem, of course, is that you have to be a candidate to benefit from a sudden surge in views of your electability. With a field winnowing down to largely white candidates, the odds that the Democratic nominee isn’t white necessarily drop significantly.

He affirmed that position Monday.

“While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S. Senate,” said Bullock’s communications director, Galia Slayen.

Bullock’s path to the presidency was premised on electability and a bet that Democrats would be intrigued by a governor who had won Trump voters without governing as a conservative. He focused his early efforts on Iowa, where Attorney General Tom Miller immediately endorsed him, and he raised $2 million in his first six weeks while emphasizing how he had saved Montana’s transparent campaign finance laws from conservative pressure.

AD

But his campaign never caught fire. Bullock missed the cutoff for the first debates in June because he was working with his Republican legislature to continue Montana’s Medicaid expansion. He narrowly secured a place onstage in the July debates, using his first question to criticize Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and warn that the party should not pick what he views as an unelectable nominee.

AD

“Watching that last debate, folks seemed more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives,” Bullock said.

Democratic voters panned that debate over its negativity and hyper-focus on Medicare-for-all, and Bullock did not qualify for future debates held under stricter polling and donation standards.

AD

He began to struggle for airtime, and his fundraising went flat.

In September, when House Democrats began an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, it became even harder for Bullock to get attention. His speech to Iowa Democrats’ Liberty and Justice Celebration was delivered to a near-empty arena; his plans on corporate taxes, infrastructure and labor law, released at the end of November, were largely ignored by the news media and voters.

AD

Bullock’s departure from the race comes after two other highly touted Democratic governors pulled the plug. Colorado’s John Hickenlooper switched to run for Senate, while Washington’s Jay Inslee decided to seek a third term. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is now the only candidate with experience as a state executive running for the Democratic nomination, announcing a last-minute bid two weeks ago — and noting that other candidates with bipartisan governing experience had not broken through.

THE KEY

Massive voting machine failures in a Pennsylvania county in November are giving election security advocates fresh ammunition to call for nationwide paper ballots.

The problems, which may have been caused by a software glitch, resulted in some Northampton County residents who tried to vote straight-ticket Democrat initially registering as straight-ticket Republican. It also incorrectly showed a Republican judicial candidate winning by a nearly statistically impossible margin, the New York Times’ Nick Corasaniti reports.

In this case, voters got lucky. The county had paper backups for all the votes the machine counted incorrectly. They showed the Democrat judicial candidate Abe Kassis — who the computer tally said got just 164 votes out of 55,000 ballots — actually narrowly won the race.

But about 16 million Americans spread across eight states won’t have a paper backup for their votes in 2020. That means a similar software glitch or a malicious hack by Russia or another U.S. adversary could cause mass uncertainty about an election’s outcome or even result in the wrong candidate taking office.

Even in Pennsylvania, it could have been different. The machines that malfunctioned in November were just purchased this year in response to a statewide mandate to upgrade to new voting machines with paper records.

Election security hawks have been pushing the importance of paper backups since 2016, when Russia probed election systems across more than a dozen states and penetrated systems in Illinois and Florida, according to the Mueller report. But even in 2016 there's no evidence any votes were counted incorrectly.

That's why the Pennsylvania debacle offers stark new evidence for how badly things could go wrong with no paper backups in place, degrading public faith in elections.

“People were questioning, and even I questioned, that if some of the numbers are wrong, how do we know that there aren’t mistakes with anything else?” Matthew Munsey, the chairman of the Northampton County Democrats, told Nick.

Lee Snover, chairwoman of the county Republicans, was just as worried. “There are concerns for 2020. Nothing went right on Election Day. Everything went wrong. That’s a problem,” she said.

Officials haven’t determined what caused the failures, but a senior intelligence official who focuses on election security told Nick there were “no visible signs of outside meddling by any foreign actors.” The miscount shows, however, how voting machine vulnerabilities could be exploited by Russia, China or Iran — which U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies said last month are all eager to interfere in the 2020 contest.

Presidential candidates were quick to make that connection.

Here’s Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who sponsored the main Senate bill that would deliver more election security money to states in exchange for paper ballots and other fixes.

All you have to do is read this to see why I’m focused on election security & passing my bills for back-up paper ballots & systematic audits. As Fiona Hill said, Russia is “gearing up.” And that’s just one possibility. https://t.co/4r3uJibzTS via @NYTimes — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) November 30, 2019

Here’s Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who dropped out of the race this morning:

House Democrats have passed bills that would require paper backups for all votes and deliver $600 million for states to upgrade voting machines and add other cybersecurity protections. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has blocked any bills that mandate specific election security fixes.

Some House Democrats were quick to seize on the Pennsylvania debacle to push the Senate to act.

Here’s Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.):

The story also sparked concern in states that will lack paper records for some voters in 2020.

Here’s John Ray Clemmons, a Democratic state representative from Tennessee:

This should concern (and, frankly, scare the heck out of) every Tennessean. Demand that your county’s #voting machines are up to date, produce a paper trail, & protected from hacking with modern, readily available and affordable tech (ie Albert sensors). https://t.co/wFpEb3Srwj — John Ray Clemmons (@JRClemmons) December 1, 2019

And Sri Preston Kulkarni, a former diplomat who’s running as a Democrat for a House seat in Texas:

We must have integrity of our elections, including paper records of every ballot and machines tested to ensure they don't switch votes.



In this case, they found the problem because 99% of the Democratic votes weren't counted. But what if it was only 5%?https://t.co/ycWQVOkUeU — Sri Preston Kulkarni (@SriPKulkarni) December 1, 2019

Other states where some voters will lack paper records in 2020 are Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey and Mississippi, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.

Northampton also demonstrates the importance of automatic “risk limiting” audits after elections to make sure that paper records back up machine results.

In this case, there was such a wide margin of victory for the Republican candidate that it was obvious something was fishy. But if hackers or a software glitch caused a much smaller shift in votes, election officials might not have caught it without an audit.

Here’s Matt Blaze, co-founder of an annual challenge to find hackable bugs in election machines at the Def Con cybersecurity conference and a cryptography professor at Georgetown University:

The tally software clearly failed, giving the (apparent) actual loser a huge margin of victory (so large it wouldn’t ordinarily trigger a re-count). But an RLA WOULD catch this. So score one for RLAs. But... — matt blaze (@mattblaze) December 1, 2019

PINGED: The Trump administration is considering tightening Commerce Department rules to restrict sales of U.S. technology to Huawei even if that technology is in products manufactured outside the United States, two sources told Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld at Reuters.

The move follows a massive crackdown on U.S. companies selling directly to Huawei, which officials say could abet Chinese spying.

It could appeal to congressional China hawks who have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to keep U.S. technology out of Huawei's hands as it tries to dominate the market for next-generation 5G wireless networks. But it ""would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,” Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson told Reuters.

The potential change follows the Trump administration's decision last week to delay a blanket ban on most U.S. companies selling parts to Huawei for another 90 days.

Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Officials at the agency also want to know why WhatsApp executives, including CEO Will Cathcart, failed to mention the spyware attack when they met with Indian leaders in July and September. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, is suing NSO for the alleged hacks which affected roughly 1,400 users globally, including many journalists and activists.

The Indian government is also seeking answers from NSO on the malware attacks, Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. NSO has denied any wrongdoing.

PWNED: Just one-third of 2020 presidential campaigns are automatically rejecting or quarantining emails that come from suspicious domains and could be part of a phishing attack, TechCrunch's Zack Whittaker reports.

Candidates whose campaigns aren’t automatically rejecting suspicious emails include President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). That could put the campaigns at a higher risk of opening malware-laden phishing emails like the one that Russia used to target Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account in 2016.

“When a campaign doesn’t have the basics in place, they are leaving their front door unlocked,” Armen Najarian, chief identity officer at Agari, an email security company told Zack.

Campaigns for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are among those automatically rejecting or quarantining suspicious emails using a tool called DMARC, which verifies a sender's email is legitimate and rejects emails that may be spoofing a real email in order to trick the recipient. That's an increase from May, when Agari researchers found that only Warren was using DMARC to block spoofed emails.

IMPEACHMENT BUT FIRST, MADRID: Impeachment mania is about to hit the House. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is overseas touting another important Democratic priority: tackling climate change.

Timing is everything: The delegation of more than a dozen Democrats to the United Nations's Convention on Climate Change serves as evidence that Pelosi is serious about her promise to “walk and chew gum” on impeachment — and to not lose sight of issues that affect everyday Americans even as the House heads into one of the most intense weeks of the inquiry against Trump so far.

Key: “Members are here because climate change is a critical issue for the U.S. and their constituents,” a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world.""

a House Democratic aide told Power Up. “It’s important for the rest of the world to hear from congressional climate leaders and for them to hear from the rest of the world."" More: ""The House is continuing its work as the impeachment inquiry continues, including taking important opportunities like this one to attend the annual UN climate conference.”

Climate change has steadily climbed up U.S. voters' list of concerns: Some 72 percent of Democrats called climate change an issue that's “very important” to them personally — second only to health care — in a CBS News poll from September.

Eye on 2020: President Trump promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions — but the pullout cannot take effect until at least a day after the 2020 presidential election. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration submitted an official notice to leave the accord, making the U.S. the only nation to abandon the global effort to address climate change.

Democratic lawmakers say they want to be clear that U.S. leadership on this issue would return if one of their candidates is elected to the Oval Office.

The message at the COP25 conference: “The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid.

“The U.S. is still committed to climate action, notwithstanding Trump,” Chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), told Power Up on Sunday evening from Madrid. Castor, whose panel will release a report advising congressional committees on potential climate action by March of next year, said it's possible that the delegation will meet with other world leaders on the sidelines of the conference.

Busy week ahead: Upon the Speaker's arrival back in Washington, she'll hit the ground running as the House moves at a breakneck pace to investigate the potential impeachment of Trump.

Monday night: The House Intelligence Committee plans to review a report on the panel's investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The House Intelligence Committee plans to review a report on the panel's investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Tuesday: The Committee is expected to approve the release of the report, which is then “expected to be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump,” per our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian.

The Committee is expected to approve the release of the report, which is then “expected to be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump,” per our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. Wednesday: The House Judiciary Committee will begin hearings to “consider the historical and constitutional standards for impeachment,” Mike and Karoun report.

The House Judiciary Committee will begin hearings to “consider the historical and constitutional standards for impeachment,” Mike and Karoun report. Big picture: While Democratic leaders ""have not committed to a firm timeline, Tuesday’s meeting keeps the House on a trajectory to possibly approve articles of impeachment on the House floor before Christmas, setting up a Senate trial on Trump’s removal early in the new year.""

The agenda in Madrid is packed, too: Countries will be under pressure to make additional commitments to reduce their carbon emissions in the wake of a string of grim reports that show that the world is not on track to reach the Paris agreement's ambitious target.

Just last week the U.N. released its annual “emissions gap” report which showed that the Earth's average temperatures is on pace to rise 3.9 degrees Celsius, as opposed to the Paris accord's agreement to keep temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday in Madrid before the conference. “What is still lacking is political will... Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.” It's a priority for Pelosi: “Taking action to protect our planet is a public health decision for clean air and clean water for our children, an economic decision for creating the green, good-paying jobs of the future, a national security decision to address resource competition and climate migration and also a moral decision to be good stewards of God’s creation and pass a sustainable, healthy planet to the next generation,” Pelosi said in a statement this weekend.

Castor told Power Up that some Republican lawmakers were invited to join the delegation but all declined. There will be a small, relatively low-profile team of diplomats who will also be attending the summit on behalf of the Trump administration. They will be focusing on what Pompeo has described as “a realistic and pragmatic model” on climate issues.

“The U.S. team is set to be led by two career officials from the State Department: climate negotiator Kim Carnahan and Marcia Bernicat, a principal deputy assistant secretary,” per Bloomberg's Jennifer Dlouhy.

“And, in another shift, political appointees from the Trump administration also won’t be attending, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement,” Dlouhy reports.

Pelosi, who has made diplomacy a hallmark of her speakership in the Trump era, is not the only one who will be traveling abroad this week to keep a focus on policy.

Not impeachment: Trump will head to London for a meeting to mark NATO's 70th anniversary. Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey.

Trump will head to London for a meeting to mark NATO's 70th anniversary. Advisers ""see the meeting as an opportunity to show him as a leader delivering on the foreign-policy pledges he made during his campaign and in office,"" per the Wall Street Journal's Catherine Lucey. Trump also hit the road over the holiday, taking a page from former President Bill Clinton's playbook: to look hard at work especially on the economy even as impeachment loomed: ""Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware,"" per our colleague Phil Rucker. This comes after Clinton's former chief strategist Mark Penn visited the White House last month.

The Investigations

THE WEEK AHEAD IN IMPEACHMENT:

The White House stays away: “White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday,” our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report.

The full 5-page letter is largely an attack on the House's impeachment process, arguing that Dems failed to provide enough opportunities for Trump to participate.

The biggest question is how long this refusal lasts : “Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings,” our colleagues write. The counsel pressed Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to detail plans for future hearings and questioned whether the White House would be able to cross-examine witnesses, including those who have testified in the public hearings.

“The decision indicates that [Trump] has listened to his allies and some congressional Republicans who argued that a White House presence at the hearing would validate a process they have harangued as illegitimate and partisan,” Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney report. What’s next?: The White House faces a Friday night deadline to detail what, if any, role they will plan in future proceedings.

Members of the Intelligence Committee will have 24 hours to review the report: It will be available to them starting at 6 p.m. tonight, Mike and Karoun report. “Their exact findings are not publicly known, but the report is expected to lay out a case for Trump’s abuse of his presidential powers — that he used the promise of a White House meeting and the withholding of military aid approved by Congress to compel Ukraine’s government to launch politically motivated investigations into his political rivals,” our colleagues write.

The Judiciary Committee is back in the spotlight: Wednesday's hearing will be the first from the panel that historically writes articles of impeachment since the Intelligence committee began its process. Four constitutional scholars are expected to testify on the standards for impeachment — three chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans, our colleagues Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report. The names of the witnesses have not yet been released, much to Republicans' frustration.

Meanwhile, Republicans continue to slam the speedy timeline: Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, ""attacked the timeline that Democratic leaders are pursuing, one that appears aimed at concluding an impeachment vote in the House before Christmas rather, he argued, than providing appropriate due process for the president,"" per our colleagues.

“They want to get this president right now before everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year,” Collins said. “So we’re rushing this.""

And one senator, John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), “said that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so,” our colleague Felicia Sonmez reports. NBC's “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd pressed the senator on the fact that this is an argument that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to see repeated by American politicians.

Key exchange: ""Are you at all concerned that you’ve been duped?” Todd asked. “No, because you — just read the articles,” Kennedy replied.

Lisa Page breaks her silence: The former FBI lawyer spoke to Molly Jong-Fast for a Daily Beast profile that details the personal toll Trump's taunts have taken on her, Page's concern over the future of the FBI and, most importantly, why she feels an upcoming report from the Justice Department's inspector general report will show she did not act unprofessionally or show bias against Trump.

Key quote: “But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States,"" Page says of Trump's constant attacks. ""And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that. To try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he’s not publicly attacking me.”

I decided to take my power back.” Per Molly, ""the president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally"" in October.

TRUMP TAKES ON NATO, AGAIN: Trump is currently set to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte at the NATO meeting, according to a senior administration official. Queen Elizabeth II is also hosting a reception to honor the occasion.

The top-tier spending club is growing: Trump as president has delighted in hammering fellow members for not spending enough on their militaries.

Carrots ahead of the visit: “The top-tier spending club — with at least 2 percent of annual gross domestic product allocated for defense — expanded by one country and now includes Bulgaria, according to figures released by the military alliance,"" Our colleague Michael Birnbaum reports. ""...NATO nations are increasing spending on defense, with nine of the alliance’s 29 members now meeting guidelines.""

The alliance also announced that it will spend less U.S. money: Leaders agreed to ""reduce the United States’ contribution to the alliance’s relatively small central budget, a move aimed at ensuring a calm leaders’ meeting,” the New York Times's Steven Erlanger reports.

Do not endorse: Trump's appearance will occur just days before Britain holds its national election. ""If past is prologue, the odds of Trump intervening in Britain’s electoral politics again in the coming days are high,"" our colleagues William Booth and Karla Adam report. The president is deeply unpopular in the country and his words could roil a campaign that is supposed to render the path forward for Brexit.

Trump is not currently set to meet with Johnson: For his part, Johnson ""tried to diplomatically dissuade the American president from offering his opinions on domestic affairs,"" our colleagues write. ""What we don’t do traditionally as loving allies and friends, what we don’t do traditionally, is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,"" Johnson said.

The Campaign

UPDATE ON THE TRAIL:

Biden rides the bus: “Former vice president Joe Biden kicked off an eight-day, 18-county bus tour Saturday as he ramps up his campaigning in rural Iowa,” the Des Moines Register's Stephen Gruber-Miller reports. It's dubbed the “No Malarkey” bus tour after one of the most famous Bidenisms.

Warren's numbers tank after Medicare-for-all debacle: “Recent polling suggests Warren has sustained political damage from her health-care policy. After climbing to the top of the field by focusing on a message of overhauling Washington and Wall Street, Warren plateaued as her campaign became consumed with health care,” our colleagues Annie Linskey, Jeff Stein and Dan Balz report.

Key graf: “The irony is that a candidate whose political identity has been built in part on her reputation as a policy wonk — a potential president who boasts of having a plan for nearly every challenge facing everyday Americans — has been tripped up by a policy issue that has dominated politics and defined her party for years,' our colleagues write.

Buttigieg goes on the offensive over college costs and gets slammed: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg unveiled a new ad attacking unnamed candidates (*cough* Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders) for wanting the government to cover the cost of everyone, “including the kids of millionaires.” The message fits perfectly with the more moderate tone Buttigieg is striking, but not everyone welcomed it.

AOC blasts Buttigieg: “This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently endorsed Sanders, wrote on Twitter.

Harris's campaign gets torched in scathing report: “In one instance after another, [Harris] and her closest advisers made flawed decisions about which states to focus on, issues to emphasize and opponents to target, all the while refusing to make difficult personnel choices to impose order on an unwieldy campaign,” the Times's Jonathan Martin, Astead W. Herndon and Alexander Burns report.

Key observation: “The 2020 Democratic field has been defined by its turbulence, with some contenders rising, others dropping out and two more jumping in just this month,” the Times reports. “Yet there is only one candidate who rocketed to the top tier and then plummeted in early state polls to the low single digits: [Harris].”

The #YangGang breaks the bank: “Andrew Yang raised $750,000 on Nov. 30, his single best fundraising day to date of his campaign,” Politico's Zach Montellaro reports. The crazy part? The haul was not tied to a debate or one of those end-of-quarter pleas that flood inboxes."

Pete Buttigieg unveiled a proposal this morning to correct troubling health disparities among African Americans and Hispanics — a crucial constituency to win over to have any hope of securing the Democratic presidential nomination.

The South Bend, Ind., mayor's eight-page proposal pledged to even the playing field for minorities who typically have worse access to medical providers and much higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic health conditions compared with white Americans.

Buttigieg has surged in the polls to lead the Democratic primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he’s in trouble in subsequent primaries in Nevada and South Carolina, where strong support from African American voters has given former vice president Joe Biden a strong lead.

Buttigieg has been criticized for his handling of racially-charged incidents within his city’s police department and has only a smattering of endorsements from black or Hispanic elected officials. That could be a huge stumbling block for his campaign, considering no Democrat in the last three decades has secured the party's nomination without a majority of black support.

Even the Onion has mocked Buttigieg’s struggles:

Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote https://t.co/f0DQKE6XhZ pic.twitter.com/Q117k4MfZb — The Onion (@TheOnion) December 2, 2019

Buttigieg is hoping to help correct this problem with promises to make the health of minorities — both through direct medical care and indirect aspects such as housing, food, education and access to clean water — a top priority.

He promises that in his first 100 days as president his administration would develop a “National Health Equity Strategy.” He also vows to help particular geographic areas combat the worst disparities and to support programs to train the health-care workforce to overcome racial bias when treating patients.

The disparities are particularly stark when it comes to life expectancy. A black man living in a rural community is likely to live seven years less than a white man living in a city. Black life expectancy at birth is about three and a half years lower than that of whites. The mortality gap between black and white Americans been cut in half since 1999, but the United States still has a long way to go before it’s eliminated.

“Millions of Americans today still find their health determined by who they are or where they live,” the paper says. “Systemic discrimination takes the form of a doctor who takes a Black person’s pain symptoms less seriously … it manifests in a hospital system that breaks ground only in a predominantly white neighborhood.”

The paper also calls for improvements in black maternal health, an area that has recently undergone increased scrutiny as celebrities including Beyoncé and Serena Williams have spoken out about their own struggles with pregnancy and childbirth. Black women are three to four times as likely to be at risk of pregnancy-related deaths as white women, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

It’s hard to overstate Buttigieg’s need to inspire confidence among black voters in particular. They’re only a tiny sliver of the electorate in the earliest primary states, but they’re much larger voting blocs in nearly every primary that comes after. Minorities comprise more than one-third of Democratic voters in the 16 states with primaries on March 3, known as “Super Tuesday.”

For now, Buttigieg is focusing on South Carolina. He’ll meet with Latino community leaders and locals in Okatie, S.C., at noon today to discuss health equity, a spokeswoman said. On Sunday, the mayor attended services at a church led by the Rev. William J. Barber II, who revived a campaign originally started by Martin Luther King Jr. to combat economic inequality.

Afterward, Buttigieg told reporters that he believes he is making progress with black voters, including those “who may yet not feel that they know me,” per the Associated Press.

“Part of what I’m trying to do is talk about these issues, including specific racial issues around voter suppression and systemic racism, in a way that helps everyone in the country understand why we all have a stake in dealing with it,” Buttigieg said.

The campaign is opening four offices and hiring 40 staffers in the state. The campaign launched its first ad there yesterday, spending $2 million on a spot that features the mayor listening to a racially diverse group of voters.

The ad:

By releasing yet another health-care proposal among the many coming out of his campaign over the last few months, he seems to be adopting the sort of “plan for everything” style his opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was first known for.

One of his other proposals is “Medicare for all who want it,” which would retain employer-sponsored coverage while allowing anyone to buy a public plan if they preferred. The approach, which the mayor rolled out over the summer, is strikingly similar to the public option plan championed by Biden — so much so, that Biden accused Buttigieg yesterday of stealing his idea.

“[Buttigieg] doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderate — moderate plan,” Biden said in an interview with Politico. “It’s the Biden plan.”

My colleague Matt Viser:

Biden says Buttigieg stole his heath care plan — and the media isn’t tough enough on him for it.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

(Susan Walsh/AP)

AHH: Three state lawmakers published op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all that were written with the help of lobbyists that either wrote drafts or made extensive edits, our Washington Post colleague Jeff Stein reports, citing emailed obtained by The Post.

Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) said op-eds they wrote about single-payer health proposals included language from lobbyist and consultant John MacDonald. Meanwhile, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) told The Post the lawmaker published an op-ed with assistance from lobbyist Kathleen Deland.

“None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist,” Jeff writes. “The emails show how, even at the state and local levels, lobbyists are trying to bend public opinion away from an idea that has seized much of the debate during the current Democratic presidential primary. … The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.”

Jeff adds that neither of the consultants would say whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a group that’s spent more than $1 million on ads warning against Medicare-for-all and other overhauls to the nation’s health-care system. A spokesman for the group also wouldn’t confirm or deny having hired MacDonald or Deland.

OOF: The stigma of addiction and criminal activity related to opioid abuse remains a barrier for victims seeking damages, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports, citing alleged victims, plaintiff lawyers and legal specialists.

“Prescription opioid abusers often are perceived to share the blame for the serious harm they experienced through addiction to prescription pills, recovering users contend,” he writes. “Unlike those injured by asbestos, medical implants or faulty automobile bags, courts have been reluctant to accept their claim that their addiction was the result of a dangerous, improperly marketed product.”

Christopher writes the settlement reached between OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and Oklahoma directed $200 million to the University of Oklahoma for a research and addiction treatment program, with another $12 million to local governments and $60 million for legal expenses.

“None of the settlement money was earmarked directly for victim compensation,” he writes. “Victim-compensation funds also have not yet been floated as part of the national-level settlements being negotiated by governments and manufacturers. The most tangible benefit for victims so far has been proposals for free anti-addiction and overdose-rescue drugs to individual communities.”

OUCH: About a fifth of adolescents ages 12 to 18 in the United States are now prediabetic, as are nearly a quarter of young adults ages 19 to 34, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The data found the rising rate of young people who are prediabetic, meaning their blood sugar levels are elevated but not quite high enough to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, means the age groups are at risk for developing the condition, CNN’s Michael Nedelman writes.

“Until recently, young children and teens almost never got type 2 diabetes, which is why it used to be called adult-onset diabetes,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Now, about one-third of American youth are overweight, a problem closely related to the increase in kids with type 2 diabetes, some as young as 10 years old.”

“Prediabetes was also more common among young people with obesity, which is also closely linked to Type 2 diabetes in adults. More than a quarter of obese adolescents and more than a third of obese young adults were found to have prediabetes — versus less than 17% of individuals with normal weight in both age groups,” Michael writes.

HEALTH ON THE HILL

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). (Susan Walsh/AP)

— A bicameral group of Democrats have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that would require doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced the brief that includes 161 House Democrats and 36 Senate Democrats.

“Lawmakers said the case still represents a direct challenge to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, even though Louisiana and its supporters have not asked the Court to formally overturn Roe,” the Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel reports. “The Democrats said upholding Louisiana’s law would allow states to effectively eliminate abortion.”

“While Act 620 purports to improve women’s health and safety, the law will actually make it more difficult for women in Louisiana to obtain safe medical care,” the lawmakers wrote. “As with other statutes targeting abortion providers and facilities, the actual legislative intent here is to mandate requirements so difficult to fulfill that the inevitable outcome is the shuttering of abortion clinics and elimination of safe and legal abortions. Indeed, if Act 620 goes into effect, Louisiana will have only a single clinic providing abortion services in the entire state.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments for the case in March.

— Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) wants state lawmakers to work with her to halt the implementation of the state’s Medicaid work requirements amid concerns that people will lose health coverage, MLive.com’s Malachi Barrett reports.

“Starting next year, most able-bodied adults between the ages of 19-61 who are enrolled in Michigan’s Medicaid expansion will have to work an average of 20 hours per week or 80 hours per month,” Malachi writes. “Whitmer said pausing the ‘punitive’ requirements is the ‘most reasonable thing’ to prevent people from losing health care coverage.”

A coalition of state and national health groups last month filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop Michigan from implementing its work rules. Other legal challenges have been filed against work requirements in Kentucky, Arkansas and New Hampshire, as well as in Indiana, which said it would pause its requirements until the case is resolved.

Goldman Sachs is popping up in some unexpected places — namely, the 2020 presidential campaign trail.

The Wall Street giant is seeking a rebrand by hosting forums for the candidates focused on small-business issues, as I wrote over the weekend.

The bank, through its “10,000 Small Businesses” program, has underwritten six of the events so far in Iowa and New Hampshire — including with former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

But not everybody’s showing up: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) both are declining to participate. “This is exactly what Sen. Sanders means when he talks about a corrupt political system,” spokesman Mike Casca said via email.

Goldman execs say the initiative is aimed at elevating small business issues in a presidential contest that has so far given them short shrift.

From the story:

Goldman Sachs’s executive vice president, John F.W. Rogers, chair of the firm’s foundation, which underwrites both the 10,000 Small Businesses program and the forums, said the events are “about putting this on the agenda of the candidates. I haven’t seen anybody say, ‘Here’s my plan for small business in America. Here’s how I’m going to address the regulations they face, the need for capital.’” “There seems to be a frustration that nobody thinks about the issues that challenge them,” Rogers said. “I hope some of these businesses will grow one day to become big enterprises and do business with Goldman Sachs,” but the firm has no direct economic stake in the program.

But the firm is also using the events to deepen its ties to the candidates, sending lobbyists from its Washington office to greet them. For the Harris event — which I attended in Ankeny, Iowa outside Des Moines — it was Joyce Brayboy, onetime chief to staff to former congressman Mel Watt (D-N.C.) who has worked for Goldman for more than a decade.

“This is the tip of the spear of Goldman’s whole strategy to reintroduce itself to America as a retail bank that cares about Main Street, rather than a global bank that was engaged in decades of illegal conduct that had devastating consequences for families across the country,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which advocates tougher regulation of the financial services industry. “This is one of the biggest banks in the world staging candidate forums not just as brand enhancement but also to put on their best face with the next president, who will be picking their regulators.”

The firm launched the “10,000 Small Businesses” program nearly a decade ago with the goal of putting that many entrepreneurs through an accelerated training in how to improve and grow their businesses. Some 9,100 have graduated, as the program grew from a pilot project at LaGuardia Community College in Queens to 19 locations, including three state-wide programs, and a national cohort. The firm decided to stage the presidential forums after it held a summit in early 2018 for graduates of the program, and 2,000 of them showed up.

Veteran Iowa political journalist David Yepsen, who moderates the forums in the Hawkeye State, said Goldman has no input into his questions. And financial regulation hasn’t come up. But the firm’s involvement is impossible to miss. More from the story:

The event was introduced by Des Moines Area Community College president Ron Denson, who touted the small-business program’s record helping its graduates expand their operations. Then the crowd heard from Elizabeth Hoppe, a coffee shop owner from Emmetsburg, Iowa, who credited her participation with enabling her to open a second location. She also thanked the bank for its “investment in small business and for providing these opportunities to discuss issues that impact our community.” On the same stage, in July, Booker name-checked Goldman’s small-business effort as a model that should be expanded. “That shouldn’t be the exception; that should be the rule,” he said, “because we know the majority of our jobs that are being created in America are jobs being created by small businesses.”

— Black Friday spending sets record: “Black Friday shoppers spent $7.4 billion online, the second largest Internet shopping day ever, according to data compiled by Adobe Analytics,” CNBC’s Alex Sherman reports.

“The $7.4 billion marked the biggest sales day ever for Black Friday and trailed only last year’s Cyber Monday’s $7.9 billion for the number 1 spot of all-time in online revenue, according to Adobe’s data. The average order value per consumer, at $168, was up nearly 6% year-over-year and also set a new Black Friday record. Adobe Analytics measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers.”

— U.S. hold on services economy slips. WSJ's Paul Kiernan: ""Over the past half-century, the U.S. has evolved from an industrial superpower into the undisputed champion of the global services economy. From 2003 to 2015, the U.S. trade surplus in services such as medical care, higher education, royalties and payments processing nearly sextupled to $263.3 billion. Growth has since stalled, however. Exports of services barely rose in the first nine months of 2019, while imports increased 5.5%. The services surplus, at $178.5 billion through September, was down 10% from the same period last year, on pace for its steepest annual decline since 2003.

""Some of the softness in service exports likely reflects cyclical factors, such as a strong dollar or slowing foreign economies. But economists say the decline in the surplus is difficult to pin exclusively on such issues. They point to other forces—some political, others more tectonic—that are weighing on exports while prompting American consumers and firms to buy more foreign services.""

— China wants tariff rollback: “Beijing’s top priority in any phase one trade deal with the United States is the removal of existing tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s Global Times newspaper reported on Sunday, amid uncertainty on whether the two sides can end a 17-month trade war that has depressed global growth,” Reuters reports.

“Global Times, published by the official People’s Daily newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also cited another unidentified source close to the talks as saying U.S. officials had been resisting such a demand because the tariffs were their only weapon in the trade war and giving up that weapon meant ‘surrender.’”

“Huawei’s latest phone, which it unveiled in September—the Mate 30 with a curved display and wide-angle cameras that competes with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 11—contained no U.S. parts, according to an analysis by UBS and Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese technology lab that took the device apart to inspect its insides. … Huawei has made significant strides in shedding its dependence on parts from U.S. companies.

— Cable execs not worried about 5G: “For about the last two decades, the cable industry has been fueled by three revenue streams: cable television, landline phones and high-speed broadband. … Recently, though, cable’s prized triple play has started to erode,” CNBC’s Alex Sherman reports.

“Investors don’t appear concerned. Cable internet has high profit margins and growth has been so strong that the two largest U.S. cable companies, Comcast and Charter, are both trading near record highs even as their business is fragmenting. Comcast added 379,000 residential high-speed broadband customers last quarter, its strongest third quarter in a decade. … While 5G is generating a ton of buzz for its ability to supposedly handle the massive amounts of data coming from artificial intelligence workloads and self-driving cars, the technology has limitations when it comes to replacing cable infrastructure.”

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: A decade that began with the Arab Spring is ending with street protests from Asia to South America and the Middle East.

Violent clashes between police and people across the planet foreshadow what will almost certainly be another volatile decade for geopolitics. The United States will need to contend in the 2020s with the growing risk of war with Iran, plus an expansionist China, a revanchist Russia and deepening cooperation between those strategic foes.

When you widen the aperture, recent demonstrations underscore not just a pervasive discontent with authoritarian regimes but also the simmering anti-elite sentiments that led to Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

The resignation on Sunday of embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi amid sustained protests for sweeping reform has set the stage for a new political crisis as the ruling class scrambles to address demonstrators’ grievances. A human rights official said more than 430 demonstrators have been killed during two months of unrest. Thousands of demonstrators are still camped out in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. This is the biggest challenge to Iraq’s political order since the U.S.-led coalition topped Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Across the border, the Iranian regime is using more violence than at any time since the Islamist revolution four decades ago to repress protests. Between 180 to 450 people, and possibly hundreds more, have reportedly been killed since the government, facing pressure from punishing U.S. sanctions, jacked up gas prices two weeks ago. Another 2,000 have been wounded and 7,000 more have been detained, according to some reports.

The last wave of major protests, which led to at least 72 people being killed, was in 2009 after a contested election. Mir Hossein Mousavi, the 77-year-old opposition leader who “lost” that election and has been under house arrest, released a rare statement on Saturday that compared this most recent crackdown to Black Friday in September 1978 when the Shah’s soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Jaleh Square, a spark that ignited the revolution.

Meanwhile, in Lebanon, members of the military formed a human chain on Sunday near the presidential palace outside Beirut to prevent violent clashes from breaking out between rival Lebanese protesters as a stalemate over forming a new government continues. Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned about a month ago in the face of protests accusing the elite of corruption and economic mismanagement, but President Michel Aoun has not formally begun the process of forming a new government.

Pro-democracy supporters rally on Monday in Hong Kong. (Vincent Thian/AP)

-- In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully in one of several authorized rallies on Sunday were dispersed with tear gas, ending a rare period of peace amid half a year of pro-democracy protests in the territory.

“The march in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side of the city had a clear message: The five demands of the protest movement, including universal suffrage and an investigation into the Hong Kong police, are not to be forgotten,” Shibani Mahtani reports from the ground. “Protesters including the elderly and children, some of whom were carrying banners calling for the end of the Chinese Communist Party, said their fight must go on despite several key successes. Residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates in local elections last week in what was widely interpreted as a resounding message of support for the cause. Those winners now control 17 out of Hong Kong’s 18 electoral districts.”

These protests began in June when the government took up a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, which would have undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy. The government withdrew that proposal, but that’s only one of the five demands. One of the other four is an independent investigation into police conduct. Authorities have resisted any accountability.

Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, endorsed an independent investigation into police brutality over the weekend. “I appeal to the government to take important confidence-building measures, including a proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police,” Bachelet wrote on Saturday in the South China Morning Post. The Chinese government criticized her comments as “inappropriate” and said her op-ed would “embolden the rioters.” (The communists derisively refer to the pro-democracy activists as rioters.)

-- South America is facing its most widespread outbreak of popular uprisings this autumn since the Cold War, from the Caribbean coast to Patagonia. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier recently explored the causes: “In Chile, fury over a pocketbook issue — a subway fare increase — has snowballed into a deeper movement against elites and a right-leaning, democratically elected government. In Peru, the street rose up to back President Martín Vizcarra in his crusade to close down a corrupt Congress. In Ecuador, indigenous groups and left-leaning students pressured their government into restoring gasoline subsidies. In Bolivia, pro-democracy and right-wing forces drove power-clinging president Evo Morales from office after his socialists stood accused of stealing an election. In Venezuela, an outlier in the current protests, a starving nation has risen up — unsuccessfully, so far — against a socialist dictatorship accused of destroying the economy.

“But all of these events are taking place against a shared backdrop: the painful aftermath of a commodities boom. Rising prices of the fuels, minerals and crops at the heart of the region’s resource-rich economies at the start of the 21st century helped lift millions out of poverty. The revenue also raised expectations — expectations now unmet in the half-dozen years since the boom went bust. A new middle class fears slipping back down the socioeconomic ladder. As nations tighten their belts in leaner times, the pressure is hitting the poor and middle classes disproportionately, while elites are largely shielded — fueling grass-roots rage. Add weak institutions, structural inequality, political polarization and a corrupt ruling class unwilling to cede power, and you have a recipe for regional unrest.”

-- There’s an inspiration factor at play, as the wind of freedom blows across borders. Though their grievances are quite different, for example, activists in the streets of Santiago have cited the struggle in Hong Kong and adopted many tactics of those protesters. Democracy has been in recession for years now, but the streets are speaking. What will come of the unrest? The truth is that we don’t know how these stories will end, which is always true but still always scary.

-- Recent scenes from Hong Kong to Iran are a testament to the power and possibility of American moral leadership when Washington gets engaged. Under bipartisan pressure, on Thanksgiving eve, Trump signed into law the resolution that passed Congress with only one holdout to offer support for the people of Hong Kong. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters celebrated by draping themselves in American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Many waved posters thanking Trump by name.

-- In protest, China announced today it will suspend U.S. Navy port visits to Hong Kong and sanction several pro-democracy organizations after Trump signed the bill. “While the nature of the sanctions remained unclear, the move appeared to back up Chinese threats that the U.S. would bear the costs of the decision,” per the AP. “The steps are ‘in response to the U.S.’s unreasonable behavior,’ foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, adding that the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act ‘seriously interfered’ in China’s internal affairs. … Along with suspending visits by official U.S. military ships and aircraft, Hua said China would sanction organizations including the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, Human Rights Watch, the International Republican Institute, Freedom House, and others that she said had ‘performed badly’ in the Hong Kong unrest.”

-- Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign is achieving its desired impact of punishing Iran, but it remains to be seen whether this will bring Tehran to the table or prompt the theocrats who are calling the shots to lash out militarily. The White House announced late last night that Trump “discussed the threat from Iran” in a Sunday phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, who is fighting for his political life and facing a possible third national election in a year, accused six European countries on Sunday of trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. “While the Iranian regime is killing its own people, European countries rush to support that very murderous regime,” Netanyahu said in a televised address on Sunday. Israel’s Foreign Ministry singled out Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Trump is meeting with the leaders of these and other European counties at the NATO summit in London on Tuesday and Wednesday.

-- A front-page story in today’s New York Times has details on how the Iranian government has massacred civilians: “It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50 percent in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders. In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators — mostly unarmed young men — in a marsh where they had sought refuge. …

“Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran’s post-revolutionary hierarchy. The authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country. On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked, which if true suggested a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. … The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said.” (The Guardian also has excellent fresh reporting on the regime’s brutal crackdown in Shiraz.)

-- Ultimately, the repression doesn’t solve the underlying frustrations that prompted protesters to so boldly risk arrest across Iran. It seems a safe bet that there will be more violence in the streets going forward. “These riots are not the last ones and it definitely will happen in the future,” said Revolutionary Guard acting commander Gen. Ali Fadavi, according to the AP.

-- Looking ahead in Iraq, a showdown looms in parliament over who will now lead the fragile democracy. Erin Cunningham and Mustafa Salim report from Baghdad: “Abdul Mahdi was appointed after months of political wrangling in parliament. His departure, approved by lawmakers on Sunday, offers authorities a chance to begin enacting real change, lawmakers and analysts said. Iraqis are fed up with high unemployment rates, widespread graft and a lack of government services. … But parliament — which is made up of rival political blocs, none of which hold a commanding majority — is unlikely to agree on a replacement, some lawmakers said. Parliament has just 15 days to choose a prime minister, who will then be granted 30 days to form a government.

“The leaders of the two largest coalitions — Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand Shiite cleric, and Hadi al-Amiri, who is backed by Iran — have publicly split over the prime minister’s resignation. In a statement last month, Sadr vowed never to work toward a political consensus with Amiri again after the latter apparently backtracked on an agreement to subject Abdul Mahdi to a no-confidence vote in parliament. Amiri was a key leader of the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of Shiite militias that was formed to battle Islamic State militants and that has enjoyed considerable support from Iran. Iran has played a significant role in Iraqi politics since Tehran threw its weight behind the militias. But that support might have backfired. Demonstrators in majority-Shiite cities such as Najaf and Karbala have stormed or burned Iranian consulates and defaced posters of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. …

“Even as lawmakers paid lip service to the need for change, they conceded that a new leader would inherit a restive and fractured nation reeling from a security crackdown that appears to have only hardened protesters’ resolve. On Sunday, a demonstrator was killed by security forces in Baghdad as the sides clashed on Rasheed Street, officials said. Demonstrators have sought to protect the vast protest site they have set up in Tahrir Square and surrounding streets, which they have transformed into a mini-republic with art installations, medical facilities, restaurants and free libraries. Police have tried to prevent demonstrators from crossing bridges that lead to government buildings and embassies in the heavily secured Green Zone.”

-- The struggle between lower-case-D democrats and autocrats will persist in the 2020s. It’s a brave new world out there. Effective Sunday, for example, the Chinese government began requiring facial scans for anyone to be able to get a cellphone or SIM card. “The policy is part of a broader push by the Chinese government to limit people’s ability to stay anonymous online,” Quartz reports.

Starting today, an 1,800-mile pipeline is set to begin delivering Russian natural gas to China. The $55 billion project is Moscow’s most significant energy play since the collapse of the Soviet Union. “The Power of Siberia pipeline is a physical bond strengthening a new era of cooperation between two world powers that have separately challenged the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reports.

As much as Trump may enjoy the company of strongmen, and politicians in both parties preach isolationism and protectionism to soothe constituents who have grown weary of war and nation-building, the United States remains locked in an existential struggle with the dark forces of autocracy that dates to our founding.

-- Closing the book on the 2010s: It didn’t really sink in for me until Thanksgiving that this tumultuous decade is ending. It’s not that I can’t read a calendar. It’s just that there are so many unfinished storylines. Years from now, however, there will be television documentaries and books that isolate the 2010s as a distinct chapter in our nation’s history. If you could sum up the teens in one word or phrase, what would it be? Besides Trump, what do you think was the single most important story of the decade? Email me at James.Hohmann@washpost.com. I’d love to highlight the most thoughtful answers here this week.

IMPEACHMENT LATEST:

-- White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter last night that Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. Mike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez report: “The invitation from Chairman Jerrold Nadler ‘does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process,’ Cipollone wrote. … Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings but asked Nadler to detail his plans for the upcoming proceedings, including whether he would allow further testimony and cross-examination of fact witnesses, among them those who already testified before the House Intelligence Committee. He also said Republicans should be able to call additional witnesses. … On Sunday, Democrats called on the White House to cooperate, suggesting an innocent person would have no problem testifying. ‘We’re certainly hoping that the president, his counsel, will take advantage of that opportunity if he has not done anything wrong,’ Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) said on ABC News’s ‘This Week.’ ‘We’re certainly anxious to hear his explanation of that.’

“But there is a conflict inside the GOP over the extent to which Trump and his congressional defenders ought to engage, even as Republicans signaled they will continue their aggressive campaign to delegitimize the process as corrupt and unfair. Speaking on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he understood why the White House might want to skip the Wednesday hearing, calling it ‘just another rerun’ covering ground already surveyed in previous Judiciary Committee hearings. ‘This is a complete American waste of time right here,’ he said. But he added that Republicans would be more keen to participate in future hearings — particularly one examining the findings of the House Intelligence Committee as prepared by its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).” Members of the Intelligence Committee are expected to review the draft of the Schiff report today and vote tomorrow (presumably on party lines) to formally transmit it to the Judiciary Committee.

-- Volodymyr Zelensky is stepping up his fight against corruption in Ukraine, despite the risk that he will anger Trump by doing so. Michael Birnbaum and David L. Stern report: “By the end of this month, more than 500 Ukrainian prosecutors will be out of their jobs as part of sweeping professional reviews under [Zelensky]. Among the prosecutors heading for the exit: a key Kyiv contact for Rudolph W. Giuliani. The prosecutor purge is just one of several corruption-busting efforts set in motion by Zelensky. But it puts into sharp relief Zelensky’s twin challenges — trying to balance his clean-government promises at home with his needs to keep President Trump from turning against him. Zelensky’s bind is not hard to spot. … Now that Zelensky’s reform push is underway, some of those Giuliani-linked officials are in the crosshairs. A prosecutor named Kostiantyn H. Kulyk is one of the first. Zelensky’s new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka — ‘100 percent my person,’ Zelensky told Trump in July — last week gave a dismissal notice to Kulyk, a key player in the effort to provide Giuliani with political ammunition of dubious accuracy.”

-- Zelenksy pushed back on Trump’s claims about corruption in Ukraine: “If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us,” he told Time Magazine and three European news outlets in a sit-down on Saturday. “I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo.” He said that Ukraine still needs U.S. support to have a chance to get back the territory Russia seized in 2014, starting with the Crimean Peninsula. He said Trump calling Ukraine corrupt makes it hard to attract foreign investment. “When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals,” he said.

“Zelensky has already learned to temper his expectations,” Time notes. “He does not expect his first round of peace talks with Russia, which are scheduled to take place in Paris on Dec. 9, to end the war that has been raging along their border for the past five years. Nor does he expect too much from his Western allies going into these negotiations.”

-- Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers who has kept a lower profile than Giuliani, says he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a New York Times profile. Unlike Giuliani, Sekulow does get compensated for representing Trump. His son Jordan and his law partner Stuart Roth are also on the Trump payroll.

-- Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page spoke to the Daily Beast after two years of silence: “Page, of course, is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news. They were hijacked by Trump to fuel his 'deep-state' conspiracy. For the nearly two years since her name first made the papers, she’s been publicly silent (she did have a closed-door interview with House members in July 2018). I asked her why she was willing to talk now. ‘Honestly, his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel’s back,’ she says. The president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally on Oct. 11, 2019. That was the moment Page decided she had to speak up. ‘I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,’ she says. ‘It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.’ ...

""On Dec. 9, the Justice Department Inspector General report into Trump’s charges that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign will come out. Leaked press accounts indicate that the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump. How does it feel after all this time to finally have the IG apparently affirm what she’s been saying all along? She said she wouldn’t discuss the findings until they were officially public, but she did note: ‘While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don’t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people. The president has a very loud megaphone.’”

-- Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) claimed that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the intelligence community’s assessment that only Russia did so. Felicia Sonmez reports: “‘I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,’ Kennedy told host Chuck Todd on NBC News’s ‘Meet the Press’ on Sunday. Todd pressed Kennedy on whether he was concerned that he had been ‘duped’ by Russian propaganda, noting reports that U.S. intelligence officials recently briefed senators that ‘this is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine.’ Kennedy responded that he had received no such warning. … Kennedy argued Sunday that Ukraine’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign have been ‘very well-documented,’ citing reporting by the Economist, the Financial Times, the Washington Examiner and others. … Despite Kennedy’s claim, there is no evidence that the Ukrainian government engaged in a large-scale effort to aid Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.”

-- The only lawmaker involved in three impeachment probes said Trump’s Ukraine conduct is “more serious” than Richard Nixon’s during Watergate. From CNN: “Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who helped draft an article of impeachment against Nixon as a congressional staffer and served on the House Judiciary Committee during President Bill Clinton's impeachment, [said] that she agrees with [Schiff] that Trump's actions involving Ukraine are ‘far more serious’ than Watergate. Congressional Democrats -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and, on Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- have compared Trump's involvement with Ukraine to the scandal that prompted Nixon to resign in 1974 rather than be impeached. ... ‘President Nixon's misconduct related to trying to use the levers of government to hide the Watergate burglary ... His misconduct had to do with trying to throw the election but at least it didn't involve involving other foreign nations,’ said Lofgren ... ‘If you take a look at the -- what the founding fathers were concerned about, it was the interference by foreign governments in our political system that was one of the gravest concerns. Nixon's behavior didn't fall into that range. So in that way, this conduct is more serious.’”

2020 WATCH:

-- Montana Gov. Steve Bullock dropped out of the presidential race this morning. He was the only Democratic candidate who had won statewide in a state Trump carried in 2016, and he was the only sitting governor in the race. Bullock said he does not plan to run for Senate. Dave Weigel reports: ""Bullock, 53, entered the race in May, arguing that a group heavy on Washington experience needed an outsider from a 'Trump state.' He rejected entreaties from national Democrats to run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Steve Daines, telling reporters that he had no interest in the job. He affirmed that position Monday. 'While he plans to work hard to elect Democrats in the state and across the country in 2020, it will be in his capacity as a governor and a senior voice in the Democratic Party — not as a candidate for U.S. Senate,' said Bullock’s communications director, Galia Slayen.""

-- Former congressman Joe Sestak is also out of the race. Sestak (D-Pa.) launched his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination about five months ago, Felicia Sonmez reports.

-- Pete Buttigieg is still struggling to win over black voters. This weekend, he used a North Carolina church visit to issue a “moral call to unity.” Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The Greenleaf Christian Church is pastored by the Rev. William J. Barber II. Barber’s effort to revive Martin Luther King Jr.’s last major project — the Poor People’s Campaign of 1968 — has inspired a multiracial movement to oppose [Trump], with plans for an assembly and ‘Moral March on Washington’ in June 2020. Buttigieg’s decision to worship with the Disciples of Christ congregation underscored the task that awaits him as he seeks to convince voters that he can credibly lead a diverse coalition to capture the White House. … The 56-year-old pastor pointedly declined to ask Buttigieg about his sexuality, saying he would no more put the question to an airline pilot. ‘But I did ask him, ‘Could he fly the plane?’ Barber remarked, as applause rang out in the pews. Barber was hardly silent on the theme, however. He opened the service by denying that anti-gay hostility was pervasive in the black community.""

-- ICYMI: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is expected to nominate financial executive Kelly Loeffler to the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). The Atlantia Journal-Constitution broke the story Friday, and other outlets have confirmed it. This defies a pressure campaign from Trump to get Kemp to put up Doug Collins, who has been an outspoken Trump defender on cable television.

-- Google and YouTube took down more than 300 video ads for Trump that violated the company's policy. From CBS News: “Lesley Stahl asked [YouTube CEO Susan] Wojcicki, ‘Have you taken down any of President Trump's ads at all?’ YouTube's CEO responded, ‘There are ads of President Trump that were not approved to run on Google or YouTube.’ When pressed for an example, Wojcicki added, ‘Well, they're available in our transparency report.’ In response to concerns raised after the 2016 election cycle, Google and YouTube, like Facebook, keep a searchable archive of political ads that have run on the site. 60 Minutes reviewed the archive to learn more about President Trump's problematic political ads. We found that over 300 video ads were taken down by Google and YouTube, mostly over the summer, for violating company policy. But the archive doesn't detail what policy was violated. Was it copyright violation? A lie or extreme inaccuracy? Faulty grammar? Bad punctuation? It's unclear. The ads determined to be offending are not available to be screened. We found very little transparency in the transparency report.”

-- Another reminder that elections have consequences: The Supreme Court will today wade into the gun control debate for the first time in a decade, making advocates for gun control nervous. From NBC News: “The court has steadfastly declined to take up any gun rights cases since ruling in 2008's Washington, D.C. v. Heller that the Second Amendment provides a right to keep a handgun at home for self-defense, and later clarifying in 2010's McDonald v. Chicago that the right applies nationwide. Now the court's willingness to take the New York case — even though the law at issue was recently repealed — has gun rights supporters feeling optimistic that it could lead to a ruling about the right to bear arms outside the home. Gun control advocates, in contrast, fear the court's new conservative majority may produce a decision that the National Rifle Association could use to fight against many of the 300 local gun restrictions enacted since the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. ‘What's really on the line is our progress against gun violence and the future of life-saving gun safety laws,’ said Hannah Shearer of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.”

-- America’s divided left is losing the battle on abortion. From the Times: “Interviews with more than 50 reproductive rights leaders, clinic directors, political strategists and activists over the past three months reveal a fragmented movement facing longstanding divisions — cultural, financial and political. Many said that abortion rights advocates and leading reproductive rights groups had made several crucial miscalculations that have put them on the defensive. ‘It’s really, really complicated and somewhat controversial where the pro-choice movement lost,’ said Johanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University who has studied the history of abortion. National leaders became overly reliant on the protections granted by a Democratic presidency under Mr. Obama and a relatively balanced Supreme Court, critics say, leading to overconfidence that their goals were not seriously threatened. Their expectation that Mr. Trump would lose led them to forgo battles they now wish they had fought harder, like Judge Merrick B. Garland’s failed nomination to the bench. Local activists in states like Alabama, Georgia, North Dakota and Missouri where abortion was under siege say national leaders lost touch with the ways that access to abortion was eroding in Republican strongholds.”

The City Hall of Villa Union is riddled with bullet holes after a gun battle between Mexican security forces and suspected cartel gunmen on Saturday. At least 19 people were killed, four of them police officers when an armed group in a convoy of trucks stormed the town 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex. (Gerardo Sanchez/AP)

MORE ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- At least 19 were killed in northern Mexico after members of a cartel battled with police and the army at a city hall. Mary Beth Sheridan reports: “The assault started at around noon on Saturday, the eve of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s first anniversary in office. Polls show Mexicans regard the failure to curb violence as the greatest weakness of the generally popular leftist leader. … The attack in the town of Villa Union, around 40 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex., highlighted how the splintering of Mexico’s top cartels has sparked more violence. It was believed to be carried out by the Cartel of the Northeast, an offshoot of the once-powerful Zetas, which is based in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Several groups that spun off from the Gulf and Zetas cartels are fighting with each other in Tamaulipas and nearby states. The attackers swept into Villa Union in at least 14 trucks, some of them armored and bearing the cartel’s logo ... The gunmen unleashed a furious battle at the town hall, peppering the facade with bullets. Terrified residents shut themselves in their homes as the pop-pop-pop of gunfire filled the air ... The attackers fled after about 90 minutes ... Mexican police and soldiers, backed by army helicopters, chased them in an operation that stretched into Sunday morning ... The dead included four state police officers, 13 alleged cartel members and two civilians kidnapped and killed by the attackers, according to Coahuila Gov. Miguel Riquelme.”

The shootout comes days after Trump said he was planning on designating Mexico’s cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, a move Mexico’s government rejected. Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to visit Mexico City this week to discuss Trump’s plan.

-- Authorities in Mexico arrested several people suspected of involvement in the killings of nine members of the LeBaron family, an extended clan of American Mormons living in Sonora. Sheridan reports: “Officials didn’t provide details, and the attorney general’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The newspaper El Universal cited sources as saying three people were arrested in Bavispe, not far from La Mora. … Julian LeBaron, a family spokesman and longtime anti-violence activist, said the three suspects detained Sunday were low-level ‘thugs.’ He and about 50 other members of his extended family are scheduled to meet with López Obrador on Monday morning. ‘We think that’s the reason why they went and picked up these local thugs — so these people can say, ‘Yeah, we did something about this,’’ he said. He said the family wasn’t satisfied with the arrests of the triggermen, but wanted the detention of ‘the people who were responsible for giving the order’ to carry out the attack.”

-- Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. Rachel Siegel reports: “‘Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers,’ Trump said in Monday morning tweet. He then directed his attention to the Federal Reserve, saying that the body should ‘act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies. This makes it very hard for our manufactures & farmers to fairly export their goods. Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!’ … The surprise announcement came after it appeared that the White House was preparing to dial back its adversarial trade approach in the months leading up to next year’s elections. … Earlier in Trump’s presidency, in March 2018, top steel suppliers including Brazil, South Korea and Japan complained that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect. At the time, Brazil was the No. 2 steel supplier to the United States.”

-- The victims in the London Bridge fatal stabbing attack were recent Cambridge University graduates dedicated to prison reform. Kim Bellware reports: “Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was identified Sunday by London’s Metropolitan Police as the second fatality in the attack. Jack Merritt, a 25-year-old from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, was identified Saturday. Both were involved with Learning Together, a prison-based education program of Cambridge. Merritt was a coordinator and Jones was a volunteer, university officials said. Jones’s family described her as ‘a funny, kind, positive influence’ whose death leaves ‘a huge void.’ … Jones’s family also highlighted her dedication to criminal justice. That passion, they said, had prompted her to apply to a police graduate recruitment program in which she hoped to specialize in victim support. … Merritt, the program coordinator at Cambridge’s Learning Together program, was remembered by his family as a ‘beautiful, talented boy’ who ‘always took the side of the underdog.’ … Merritt’s family urged the public not to use his death as a justification for the kinds of punitive sentencing he fought against.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his rival Jeremy Corbyn traded blame over the early release of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, a convicted Islamist terrorist who was let go from prison halfway through his 16-year sentence for plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange. William Booth reports: “Khan, who was freed on parole 11 months ago with an electronic tracking device on his ankle, began his attack Friday afternoon as he was entering a conference intended to rehabilitate violent offenders and terrorists. … Johnson, appearing on a BBC political affairs show, said ‘the reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release, which was brought in by a lefty government.’ He was referring to the government of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, which ended in 2010. … Johnson refused to concede any responsibility. Whatever the Tories failed to do in the past, his government will fix it if he wins a majority in the Dec. 12 elections, he said. … Corbyn, Johnson’s principal opponent in the elections, called the government’s early release of Khan ‘a complete disaster’ and called for a ‘very full investigation.’ In a speech in York on Sunday, Corbyn took aim at the cuts to police forces since the Conservatives came into power — a deficit of some 20,000 officers compared to years before.”

-- Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said he will step down next month, after an investigation into the 2017 killing of a journalist raised questions about the role of his former chief of staff and ensnared other members of his inner circle. Chico Harlan reports: “‘This is what the country needs at the moment,’ Muscat said in a nationally televised address. He said he would resign as leader of his own party on Jan. 12 and step down as prime minister of the Mediterranean island nation of half a million people in ‘the days after.’ The decision was the largest political convulsion yet in the investigation into the car bomb death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a widely read investigative journalist who focused on the corruption of Maltese politicians and other power brokers.”

-- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the U.S. must avoid a “hot war.” From CNN: “Back in 1989, the United States and the Soviets were on opposite sides of the conflict, with Washington supporting mujahideen fighters trying to topple the government of Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime. But just over two years later, the USSR collapsed, assistance to the Kabul government dried up and Najibullah's government fell. Asked what lessons could be drawn from the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Gorbachev said: ‘They must be withdrawn. That is the main lesson. You know, it's like a match. The match is lit, a fire spreads. And these clashes, when the leading, largest countries in this conflict become ever more involved, they are dangerous for all nations.’

""The fall of the Berlin Wall was preceded by another pivotal moment: The signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987. That pillar of arms control effectively fell apart this year, after the United States formally withdrew and the Russian government said it had been consigned to the trash can. Asked about the demise of the treaty that he signed alongside Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev expressed a hope that such arms control agreements could be revived. … The ultimate goal of arms control, he added, must be to get rid of nuclear weapons completely. That, however, seems a more remote possibility, given the enduring mistrust between Moscow and Washington. US-Russian relations are now at their worst since the Cold War, but Gorbachev expressed hope that it would be possible for Washington and Moscow to find a way to prevent a ‘hot war’ in the future.”

-- A U.S. drone strike killed civilians, Afghan officials claimed. From the Times: “An American drone strike on a car carrying a woman who had just given birth in southeastern Afghanistan left five people dead, including the mother, three of her relatives and the driver, Afghan officials and family members said on Sunday. The strike in the Alisher District of Khost Province occurred either late Friday night or early Saturday, they said. The woman, Malana, 25, had given birth to a son, her second child, at home. But her health had deteriorated soon after and relatives had been taking her to a clinic. On their way home, their vehicle was hit. After the strike, there was confusion about whether the newborn was among the victims. Later, it became clear that the baby had not been in the car. Turab Khan, a relative, said the boy was safe at home.”

-- Gunmen in Burkina Faso massacred 14 Christians during a church service. Danielle Paquette reports: “Sunday’s massacre follows a string of attacks by radical Islamist insurgents on military posts, a mining convoy and places of worship in the restive countryside that the cash-strapped military has struggled to contain. The assailants fled on motorbikes after spraying bullets into the Protestant congregation, authorities said. … No group has asserted responsibility for the attack yet, but fighters linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda routinely ambush soldiers and civilians in a campaign to sow division, gain recruits and seize territory. … The church ambush in Hantoukoura follows attacks on places of worship that have killed dozens this year in the country’s borderlands. … The gunfire is often indiscriminate, analysts say, but extremists have targeted men for wearing crosses and Muslim leaders who do not follow their rules.”

-- Political leaders and diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks, starting today, for talks on climate change. From the BBC: The meeting “was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. … This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but [Trump] will not be among them. However, [Nancy Pelosi] will attend the conference with a congressional delegation.""

(Andrew Harnik/AP)

With Mariana Alfaro

THE BIG IDEA: What emails about Ukraine does President Trump think, or hope, will never get out?

During two interviews with FBI agents and members of Bob Mueller’s team last year, former White House communications director Hope Hicks recounted the president’s reaction to the discovery of damning emails about the meeting his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort took with a Russian emissary at Trump Tower in June 2016.

“Throughout Hicks’ conversations with Trump, it was clear to her that Trump did not think the emails would get out,” according to the FBI’s summary of her first interview, which was released on Monday night in response to an open-records lawsuit. “Hicks’ impression was Trump meant the emails would not get out to the press, but he did not say that explicitly.”

Hicks said she thought the messages would come out eventually and warned Trump that they would become “a massive” story.” She wanted “Junior” – as the FBI summaries refer to the president’s eldest son – to give an interview to a friendly media outlet, where he could take “softball questions,” to minimize the fallout. “The President said they should not do anything, asked why so many people had the emails, and said they needed to let the lawyers deal with it,” Hicks recalled to the FBI.

There are no fresh bombshells in these new summaries. The juiciest material appeared in Mueller’s 448-page report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the memos about Hicks’s FBI sit-downs, which both occurred in March 2018, offer a revealing window into how Trump tries to control bad news. Trump’s unwillingness to rip off the Band-Aid and get out in front of bad facts has resulted in a drip, drip, drip of revelations that have clouded most of his tenure in office.

-- Hicks’s comments are newly relevant against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry. The White House’s categorical refusal to comply with subpoenas for documents, from phone records to emails, has made it harder for investigators to corroborate sworn testimony from witnesses about the alleged campaign to coerce Ukraine’s new president to announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden in exchange for a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid that had already been approved by Congress.

A confidential White House review of Trump’s decision to freeze the aid has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, three of my colleagues reported last week. But none of those emails have been turned over to investigators.

Trump appointees at the departments of State, Energy and Defense have also defied subpoenas and refused to produce documents that get at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. They have justified doing so by making absolutist claims of presidential privilege that have led to protracted litigation in the courts. The White House is refusing to participate at all in the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing on Wednesday.

For her part, Ivanka Trump repeatedly conducted official government business on her personal email account throughout much of 2017, sending hundreds of emails in potential violation of federal recordkeeping rules. The White House adviser did so after her father made Hillary Clinton’s private email use as secretary of state a centerpiece of his stump speech, egging on crowds as they chanted “Lock her up.” The House Oversight Committee has unsuccessfully sought to subpoena Ivanka Trump’s emails.

-- House Democrats are also quietly debating whether they should expand articles of impeachment to include charges stemming from the Mueller report, including the episode Hicks discussed with the FBI. “Members of the House Judiciary Committee and other more liberal-minded lawmakers and congressional aides have been privately discussing the possibility of drafting articles that include obstruction of justice or other ‘high crimes’ they believe are clearly outlined in [the Mueller report] — or allegations that Trump has used his office to benefit his bottom line,” Rachael Bade reports. “The idea, however, is running into resistance from some moderate Democrats wary of impeachment blowback in their GOP-leaning districts, as well as Democratic leaders who sought to keep impeachment narrowly focused on allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals … The debate is expected to play out in leadership and caucus meetings this week.”

When the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks to appear for a closed-door interview this June about the possible instances of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report, the former White House communications director refused to answer any question related to her interactions with Trump after Election Day in 2016. Citing a directive from White House lawyers, Hicks declined to answer 155 different questions from lawmakers, according to a transcript.

-- BuzzFeed News and CNN filed lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of these FBI notes, known as “302 reports,” that were created as part of the two-year Mueller probe. The 295-page tranche that went out last night is quite repetitive, and the interviews are still mostly whited out. The media outlets pledged to challenge the heavy redactions as part of the ongoing litigation to obtain records.

Hicks left the White House last year and now works at the Fox Corporation in Los Angeles as a public relations executive. During another closed-door deposition in February 2018, while she was still employed by the White House, Hicks acknowledged that she occasionally told “white lies” for Trump. Hicks was advised at the beginning of both her interviews that it is a crime to lie to the FBI in the course of an investigation, which she acknowledged.

-- Hicks told the FBI agents that “Trump was angry, surprised, and frustrated” when Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May 2017. “The only other time she had seen Trump like that was when the Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign,” according to the FBI notes.

“Trump thought the fact that the intelligence community assessed the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election was his Achilles heel,” she added, according to the summary. “Even if it had no impact on the election, Trump thought that was what people would think. He thought the assessment took away from what he did.”

-- Hicks was treated like family during her time as a member of the Trump inner circle. The president referred to her affectionately as “Hopey.” He called her more often than his chief of staff at the time. The onetime fashion model from Greenwich, Conn., whose dad was a top executive at the NFL, was tight with the president’s kids, who she had gotten to know during her work for the Trump Organization before the presidential campaign.

That’s how she ended up in the White House residence on the morning of June 22, 2017, with only Trump, Kushner and Ivanka Trump. “Kushner had a manila folder with documents with him and said to the President that they had found one thing that the President should know about, but it was not a big deal,” according to Hicks’ account. “Kushner told Trump that he, Don Jr. and Paul Manafort had attended a meeting during the campaign. When he started to open the folder, Hicks said, the president stopped him and said he did not want to know about it.” Hicks believed Kushner’s folder included emails about the June 2016 meeting.

The next week, on June 28, Kushner asked Hicks and his spokesman Josh Raffel to go to the offices of someone whose name has been redacted (perhaps a lawyer) to review documents. “Hicks was shocked by the emails concerning the meeting she and Raffel reviewed,” the FBI write-up says. “She thought they looked really bad.”

The next day, on June 29, Hicks joined Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the president in his personal dining room to discuss about the emails. “Hicks’ initial reaction was that they should get in front of the emails,” according to the FBI summary. “Kushner responded that it wasn’t a big deal, just a meeting about Russian adoption. Kushner reminded the president that he had previously mentioned a meeting, and the President said he did not want to know about it.”

When Hicks said the story was going to become “massive,” the FBI summary says, “the President did not want to talk about it and did not want details.” Trump then asked Kushner when his document production was due. Kushner told him it would be a couple of weeks. “Then leave it alone,” Trump told Kushner, according to Hicks.

Fast forward a week to July 7. Kushner and Ivanka Trump came to Hicks’s hotel room in Germany to confer about how to respond to a story the New York Times was working on about the Trump Tower meeting. The next day, while they were all at the G-20 summit, Hicks alerted Trump about what the Times was chasing. The president told her not to comment.

Hicks and Trump talked again later that day. “The President asked what the meeting was about. Hicks told him Kushner and Junior had told her the meeting was about Russian adoption,” according to the FBI summary. “The President said words to the effect of, ‘Then just say that,’ and dictated what she should say.”

When they got to Air Force One for the flight back, one of Junior’s representatives texted Hicks the statement that the president’s son wanted to provide to the media. “She took that to the President’s cabin and read him Junior’s statement,” according to the FBI summary. “He told her they should not respond. Hicks advocated for providing the full story. The President did not say what was wrong with Junior’s statement, but just felt they were giving the media too much. … After meeting with Trump about Junior’s statement, Hicks returned to a seat and started texting with Junior. They worked on the statement for a period and ultimately settled on the statement that went to the press.”

During that flight back to Washington, Hicks also went to Trump’s cabin to tell him that then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus knew about the emails. There are four redacted paragraphs about what happened next.

-- A reminder of what was in the emails: British music publicist Rob Goldstone, who Don Jr. knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, emailed the candidate’s son to say that he knew a person who wanted “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone explained: “This is part of Russia and its government’s support of Trump”

“[I]f it’s what you say I love it,” Don Jr. replied, “especially later in the summer.”

That’s how the Trump Tower meeting got set up. It wasn’t adoption.

During the transition, Hicks told reporters in a statement that the Trump campaign had “no contact” with “any foreign entity,” including the Russians. She told the FBI that she recalled talking about this with fellow advisers Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Jason Miller and “probably” Kushner. “Hicks told the group she was planning to respond to the press and there was no hesitation or pushback from any of them,” according to the FBI notes.

-- Other takeaways from the FBI notes released last night:

1. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, told FBI agents in November 2018 that he informed Trump during the campaign that he had spoken with a “woman from the Kremlin” about the plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. “Cohen told Trump he spoke with a woman from the Kremlin who had asked specific and great questions about Trump Tower Moscow, and that he wished Trump Organization had assistants that were that good and competent,” according to the FBI summary.

“He also said that in his letter to Congress about the development, he initially wrote that he had ‘limited contact with Russian officials.’ But that line was struck from the letter. Cohen said he did not know who specifically struck it,” BuzzFeed notes. “It was the decision of the JDA to take it out,” the document says, referring to lawyers from the Joint Defense Agreement who represented the Trump family, Cohen, and Kushner, “and Cohen did not push back.” Cohen also told the FBI that he spoke with Trump’s attorney Jay Sekulow about pardons after his home and office were raided. Sekulow told the AP that Cohen's statements were false.

2. Former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates told the FBI that, if Rudy Giuliani had been the attorney general, some in the president’s orbit believed he wouldn't have recused himself, as Jeff Sessions did, from the Russia investigation. “After the recusal, he recalled conversations where people offered their opinion that had Rudy Giuliani been attorney general, he would not have recused himself,” according to the FBI summary. “Gates knew Giuliani had been the first choice for attorney general, but turned it down because he wanted to be Secretary of State instead.”

3. Former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein told the FBI he was “angry, ashamed, horrified and embarrassed” at how Jim Comey was fired as FBI director. “Rosenstein said he was asked during a White House meeting one day before Comey’s firing to produce a memo laying out his concerns with the FBI chief. He said he knew when he left the office that day that Comey would be fired, though he said he did not expect for his memo to be immediately released, and was surprised by the portrayal in the media that the termination was his idea instead of the White House’s,” the AP reports. “Rosenstein said he expected Comey would be contacted by either Trump or Sessions so a meeting could be scheduled and he could be fired in person. Comey instead learned of his firing from television while speaking with agents in Los Angeles.

“At one point during the interview, as Rosenstein was describing how he had ‘always liked Jim Comey’ but disagreed with his decisions in the Clinton case, the deputy attorney general ‘paused a moment, appearing to have been overcome by emotion, but quickly recovered and apologized,’ according to the FBI.”

-- The Post just published a six-part digital series to go along with the illustrated Mueller report. This is drawn directly from episodes detailed in the report in which prosecutors found possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as congressional testimony and Washington Post reporting. Dialogue is taken from text messages, contemporaneous notes and interviews conducted by Mueller’s team and the FBI. The digital project pairs with a graphic nonfiction book being published today by Scribner.

Attorney General William Barr listens as Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Nov. 26. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Attorney General Bill Barr has told associates he disagrees with the Justice Department’s inspector general on one of the key findings in an upcoming report about the FBI’s Russia investigation. Barr appears to disagree “that the FBI had enough information in July 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign,” Devlin Barrett and Karoun Demirjian scoop. “The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horo­witz, is due to release his long-awaited findings in a week, but behind the scenes at the Justice Department, disagreement has surfaced about one of Horowitz’s central conclusions on the origins of the Russia investigation. … The inspector general report, currently in draft form, is being finalized after input from various witnesses and offices that were scrutinized by the inspector general. Barr or a senior Justice Department official could submit a formal letter as part of that process, which would then be included in the final report.”

-- The Ukrainian government became aware of Trump’s freeze on military aid in July, according to former deputy foreign minister Olena Zerkal. From the Times: “‘We had this information,’ Ms. Zerkal said in an interview. ‘It was definitely mentioned there were some issues.’ … Ms. Zerkal’s account is the first public acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official that senior figures in Kyiv knew about the aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and that the Zelensky administration sought to keep that fact from surfacing to avoid getting drawn into the American impeachment debate. She said her own government blocked a trip she had planned to Washington to meet members of Congress in October, worried she would discuss matters related to impeachment and drag its president into an inquiry he has been eager to avoid. ‘They worried about this,’ she said of Mr. Zelensky’s advisers. ‘They said, ‘This is not the time for you to travel to D.C.’’ The cancellation of her trip was confirmed by Congressional aides.”

-- The Ukraine pressure campaign began as an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation. Rosalind S. Helderman reports: “As 2018 came to a close, the special counsel investigation was bearing down on [Trump.] … It was in this uncertain moment that [Giuliani] said he had the idea to focus on Ukraine. … The direct connection between the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine pressure campaign, often lost as the administration has reeled from controversy to controversy, shows the deep imprint the Russia investigation has had on the president. … Giuliani has repeatedly said the public does not appreciate the extent to which his work in Ukraine was driven by the Mueller investigation, rather than — as Democrats have alleged — as an effort to bolster Trump’s 2020 reelection.”

-- The Senate Intelligence Committee already investigated allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 campaign. From Politico: “Trump’s allies have defended his demand for political investigations from Ukraine by claiming that the government in Kyiv tried to sabotage his candidacy … But the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry, and found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016. The committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in October 2017 that the panel would be examining ‘collusion by either campaign during the 2016 elections.’ But an interview that fall with the Democratic consultant at the heart of the accusation that Kyiv meddled, Alexandra Chalupa, was fruitless, a committee source said, and Republicans didn’t follow up or request any more witnesses related to the issue.”

-- House Republicans said Trump acted out of “genuine” concern about corruption in Ukraine and wariness about foreign aid in a preemptive rebuttal to Democratic allegations that Trump abused his power. Mike DeBonis reports: “In a 123-page draft report, GOP investigators assert that Democrats failed to make the case that Trump committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors ... Nor, the Republicans say, do Democrats have a basis for impeachment in Trump’s decision to spurn House document requests and witness subpoenas pertaining to Trump’s Ukraine dealings. Instead, the draft GOP report contends, the impeachment effort is ‘an orchestrated campaign to upend our political system’ … The Republican report will serve as an initial blueprint for the GOP defense of Trump…”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the majority’s report will be released publicly today. “We are putting the finishing touches on the report,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. The panel is scheduled to vote this evening to approve its public release ahead of tomorrow’s Judiciary hearing.

-- Federal prosecutors will probably bring more charges against Giuliani’s associates Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas. From NPR: “A superseding indictment — which could add to or modify the existing charges — is likely, prosecutors said on Monday, but also adding that they're continuing to evaluate the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and FBI investigators are making their way through what prosecutor Douglas Zolkind called a ‘voluminous’ amount of evidence in the case — around 9 gigabytes' worth. Clearing their way through that material — which includes electronic devices, phone records, bank records and more — would set the stage for the next steps.”

-- The IRS whistleblower who raised concerns about political interference in the presidential audit program declined to voluntarily appear for a transcribed interview with the Senate Finance Committee, possibly because he was threatened with retaliation by his superiors. From CNN: “After raising concerns over the summer, the whistleblower met in November with Republican and Democratic staffers on the committee but has declined an invitation to appear for a follow-up … [T]he whistleblower declined the transcribed interview after an official informed the whistleblower that it could be considered a violation of IRS code to provide the committee with any information related to an individual taxpayer. Under IRS code 6103, IRS employees can be fired, fined or even jailed for disclosing taxpayer information. It is unclear what next step the committee will take. One option would be to issue a subpoena, but it is not clear that is the route the committee would take.”

Duncan Hunter leaves federal court after a hearing in San Diego.(Denis Poroy/AP)

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) plans to plead guilty to misusing campaign funds at a hearing set for 1 p.m. Eastern. “I think it’s important not to have a public trial for three reasons. And those three reasons are my kids,"" Hunter said in an interview with San Diego-based TV station KUSI. In July, federal prosecutors alleged that the congressman used campaign donations to finance extramarital affairs -- including trips, dinners and drinks -- with at least five women, including three lobbyists, a woman who worked in his congressional office and another who worked for a member of House leadership. Hunter told the local TV station that he “did make mistakes” but that “not a single dime of taxpayer money is involved in this.” He said he will plead guilty to only one of four counts against him as part of the deal. ""Whatever my time in custody is, I will take that hit,"" he said.

When he was first indicted last summer, Hunter called this a politically motivated witch hunt and said he was looking forward to the trial so he could fully vindicate himself. Initially, Hunter and his wife were charged with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including family vacations, theater tickets and school tuition. The couple allegedly agreed in electronic communications to claim that some of the expenses were intended to help veterans, even though they weren't. Then, in June, Margaret Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with her husband to spend $25,000 in campaign funds for personal use. As part of the plea deal, she flipped on her husband and agreed to testify against him.

Today's plea deal means that the first two members of Congress to endorse Trump for president in 2016 will be convicted criminals. Hunter and Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) came out for Trump in February of that year, about a week before Jeff Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump. Earlier this year, Collins resigned from Congress and pleaded guilty to insider trading charges. The crime he confessed to occured while he was standing on the White House lawn at a picnic hosted by Trump. These episode underscore just how swampy Trump's Washington has been.

Hunter didn't say whether he will resign as part of the plea deal, but that seems like a safe assumption. He's already facing serious primary challenges from former congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and former San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio, Felicia Sonmez notes. Hunter won the congressional seat after his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., retired from it to run for president in 2008.

-- The North Dakota company that Trump urged military officials to hire for border wall construction received a $400 million contract to build a span of new barriers across an Arizona wildlife refuge. Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report: “North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel won the contract to build in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in Yuma County, Ariz., the Defense Department said, with a target completion date of Dec. 30, 2020. Trump has repeatedly pushed for Fisher to get a wall-building contract, urging officials with the Army Corps of Engineers to pick the firm — only to be told that Fisher’s bids did not meet standards. Trump’s entreaties on behalf of the company have concerned some officials who are unaccustomed to a president getting personally involved in the intricacies of government contracting.

""Trump has been enamored with Tommy Fisher, the company’s chief executive, who has made multiple appearances on Fox News to promote his firm and insists that it would do a better job than those the government had already chosen. ... Fisher has worked with some Trump allies — including former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach and ex-White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon — to build border fencing on private land using private donations. ... Trump has pledged to complete 450 to 500 miles of new border barriers by the end of next year. So far his administration has built about 85 miles of fencing, almost all of it in areas where tall steel bollards are replacing smaller, older structures that were there before he took office.""

-- A new biography of Melania Trump by CNN’s Kate Bennett reveals that the first lady doesn't just live in her own bedroom. She actually lives on a different floor of the White House than the president: “Melania Trump has her own quarters in the White House. ... It is true the first couple doesn't share a bedroom, according to several sources, and the first lady prefers her own large, private space in a suite of rooms on a separate floor.” Bennett also reveals that the first lady was “beside herself with guilt” after her speech at the Republican National Convention was criticized for including parts from a speech given by Michelle Obama: “Not only did Melania Trump feel badly for her speechwriter, she also felt she had let down her husband on what should have been her most triumphant speaking engagement to date. The truth was, sources conclude, it was Donald Trump that let down Melania Trump. A skeleton staff of political neophytes neglected to read Melania Trump's speech, much less vet it for content.”

-- According to the new book, the first lady suspects that longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone was behind the release of nude photos from her modeling days during the 2016 campaign. From the Guardian: “Bennett also writes that the first lady ‘still refuses to believe’ her husband played a role in the release. ... Stone denied Bennett’s claim while the White House poured scorn on her book.”

-- The Supreme Court heard a Second Amendment case for the first time in a decade, but the debate ended up being on whether a case concerning gun restrictions is still worth considering. Robert Barnes reports: “The controversy involves now-rescinded restrictions unique to New York City about whether citizens who have a license to keep a gun in their homes may transport them to firing ranges outside of the city or to a second home in the state. After the Supreme Court took the case to decide whether those restrictions violated the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the city got rid of them. Then the state of New York passed a law that would keep them from being reenacted. The unstated purpose of both the city and state actions might have been to make the case moot and deny conservatives on the court a chance to explore whether there is a right to carry a gun outside the home. … The arguments Monday suggested that New York would have had trouble defending the old regulations. But most of the hour-long discourse was consumed with questions about whether the court still has a live controversy before it, a requirement for rendering an opinion. The court denied New York’s earlier plea to dismiss the case as moot. It said it would consider the question after argument.”

-- Barr's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to let federal executions proceed next week by “setting aside” a district court’s injunction that blocks it from carrying out lethal injections as planned. Mark Berman reports: “This request, which came hours after an appeals court blocked a similar application, marked an escalation of the administration’s push to restart federal executions after a nearly two-decade hiatus. …. The Justice Department argued in its 38-page filing Monday that the judge’s interpretation of the law is ‘implausible.’ The filing, signed by Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, dismissed what it called a ‘flawed injunction against the implementation of lawful executions.’ [Barr], in announcing plans to resume executions, had said the department owes it to victims to carry out the sentences, though some relatives of the first inmate facing execution have urged the administration to call off the lethal injection and sentence him to life in prison instead.”

-- Trump recently gave states the power to ban refugees. But deeply conservative and devout Utah wants more of them. Griff Witte reports: “The governor, a Republican who aligns with Trump on most issues, wrote the president a letter in late October. He didn’t want to keep refugees out. He didn’t want to reduce their numbers. He wanted Trump to send more. ‘We empathize deeply with individuals and groups who have been forced from their homes and we love giving them a new home and a new life,’ Gov. Gary R. Herbert wrote. Such newcomers, he added, have become ‘productive employees and responsible citizens.’ They have been an asset to Utah, he said, not a liability. Republicans in the state legislature quickly backed up their governor, daring to defy a president who has repeatedly shown an unwillingness to tolerate intraparty dissent. So did Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation. So did Republicans in city halls. Democrats across Utah added their support. ‘I have to be honest: I don’t have any idea why it’s a partisan issue nationally. It’s never been one here,’ said Brad Wilson, the state’s Republican speaker of the House. ‘Regardless of political party, we value these people.’”

-- Ballroom dancers say a clampdown on immigration is hurting business. From the AP: “When no Americans replied to her ads seeking a dance instructor, studio owner Chris Sabourin looked overseas. But she was stymied again by a federal tightening of visa application rules she and others contend is hampering the ballroom dance industry. … Federal records ... show a slight uptick since 2017 in initial denials of O-1 visa applications from individuals with 'extraordinary ability or achievement' — the visa that many of the foreign dancers seek — as well as for O-1 visa applicants who were given a second chance to meet eligibility requirements. Representatives of the dance industry say they’ve seen the processing times for those nonimmigrant visas, which allow the dancers to work in the U.S. for up to three years, increase from weeks to months, with uncertainty the application will be approved.”

-- A janitor working for the Border Patrol saved and photographed migrants’ belongings that were thrown away by U.S. officials. From the Los Angeles Times: “While working as a janitor at the same facility from 2003 to 2014, photographer Tom Kiefer secretly collected the belongings and later began shooting them. … The first items to pull Kiefer’s attention were 15 to 20 toothbrushes. At the time, he didn’t think about photographing them. He just felt compelled to remove them from the trash. ‘When I started seeing a rosary, or a Bible, or a wallet, I realized that no one would believe me if I had not collected these items.’ It took about six years of collecting — blankets, cellphones, toilet paper, depression medication, shoelaces — before Kiefer began photographing. … Kiefer estimates he has more than 100,000 items collected and stored in his studio and other spaces around Ajo. The word he uses to describe how he copes with the magnitude of his collection: compartmentalize. … ‘Our government is actually taking away a Bible or rosary,” he said. “I mean, how twisted is that?’”

-- The United Auto Workers has bolstered its financial controls in an effort to prevent embezzlement and bribery that was uncovered as part of a federal probe of the union. From the AP: “The moves announced Monday by Secretary-Treasurer Ray Curry come after last month’s resignation of President Gary Jones, who has been implicated in the scandal. Several other union officials have been charged or implicated in the probe, which embarrassed the union leadership and angered many of its 400,000 members when it became public starting in 2017. Curry says the reforms will put checks and balances in place to prevent financial misconduct.”

-- Former president Jimmy Carter was hospitalized again to treat a urinary tract infection. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The Carter Center says ‘he is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon.’ The incident comes three weeks after Carter was hospitalized ahead of a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by a subdural hematoma, a collection of blood outside the brain, spurred by his recent falls. He was released from the hospital on Wednesday, in time for Thanksgiving, and there were no complications from the surgery.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Cracks in the Greenland ice sheet are producing massive waterfalls, raising scientists’ concerns for sea level rise. Andrew Freedman reports: “A cerulean lake consisting of glacial meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, located about 18 miles from where the Store Glacier meets the sea in west Greenland, briefly became one of the world’s tallest waterfalls during the course of five hours in July 2018. The waterfall, like many others on the ice sheet’s surface, was triggered by cracks in the ice sheet. In the case of this one meltwater lake that scientists closely observed in July 2018, the water cascaded more than 3,200 feet to the underbelly of the glacier, where the ice meets bedrock. There, the water can help lubricate the base of the ice sheet, helping the ice move faster toward the sea. The observations of scientists, armed with aerial drones and other high-tech equipment, of the partial lake drainage that resulted could help researchers better understand how surface melting of the ice sheet could affect its melt rate, and improve global sea level rise projections.

“Scientists are keenly interested in how meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet — the largest contributor to global sea level rise — acts to speed up the movement of ice toward the sea by lubricating the underside of the ice surface. The new study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that scientists are underestimating the number of melt ponds that partially, and rapidly, drain into the ice sheet each year. This means tweaks may be needed to the computer models used to predict sea level rise from Greenland. This is the first study to show that partial lake drainage can occur through cracks in the ice, rather than overtopping or other mechanisms, which was previously the assumption. This means even more water is reaching the base of the ice sheet than previously thought.”

-- Trump revved up his global trade war yesterday by not only announcing tariffs on metals from Brazil and Argentina, but also by threatening even harsher penalties on dozens of popular French products. David J. Lynch, Rachel Siegel and Terrence McCoy report: “The administration said the moves were necessary because U.S. trading partners were acting unfairly to disadvantage both the country’s traditional economic pillars as well as its best hopes for future prosperity. … The unexpected announcement upends the Latin American countries’ 2018 agreement with Trump to accept quotas on their shipments to the United States instead of the import taxes. … Later, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, released the results of a five-month investigation that concluded a French digital services tax discriminated against American Internet companies and should be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion in products such as cheese, yogurt, sparkling wine and makeup. The proposal, which awaits a presidential decision, threatens to intensify simmering transatlantic trade friction …

“Fallout from the president’s renewed embrace of tariffs could cloud prospects for future or ongoing talks with countries in Asia and Europe. … Administration officials worry that the French tax could set a precedent for other countries. Lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in Austria, Italy and Turkey. … The president’s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy. … Typically, the United States provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes, delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at American ports without being taxed. But the president tweeted that his tariff order was ‘effective immediately.’”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, hit with the new tariffs, has learned the hard way what so many others have discovered before him: A good personal relationship with Trump has its limits. David Nakamura and Anne Gearan report: “Bolsonaro and his country’s diplomats in Washington were blindsided after Trump issued a pair of early morning tweets announcing punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports … For Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who had patterned his campaign after Trump’s and aggressively sought to ingratiate himself with the White House, the tariffs represented an embarrassing reality check on his strategy of gambling his administration's foreign policy largely on good personal chemistry with a president who craves validation — but who views virtually all relationships as transactional and, potentially, disposable.”

-- This is not the first time that Bolsonaro has gotten burned by Trump. Terrence McCoy reports: “Over and over in recent months, Bolsonaro has been surprised and stung by Trump’s slights and about-faces. Trump told Bolsonaro this year he would back Brazil’s bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a promise Bolsonaro then touted as a political achievement. But then the U.S. recommendation letter leaked, showing that the Trump administration was supporting Romania and Argentina for membership, not Brazil. A few weeks later, the U.S. government refused Bolsonaro’s request to lift its ban on Brazilian imports of beef over safety concerns — again taking his administration by surprise. Now Trump is targeting one of the most important industries in Brazil, at a time when unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled.”

-- Stocks sank amid disappointing manufacturing and construction data and Trump’s escalating trade wars. Taylor Telford and Thomas Heath report: “‘All this trade friction is weighing on the manufacturing sector, reminding us that protectionism is not a victimless crime,’ said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Nine of 11 stock market sectors declined Monday, with industrials, information technology and real estate leading the slide. All but seven of the Dow 30 blue chips finished in negative territory, with Boeing, American Express and United Technologies the biggest drags.”

-- The Trump administration quietly released more than $100 million in military assistance to Lebanon after months of unexplained delays that led some lawmakers to compare it to the frozen aid for Ukraine that prompted the impeachment inquiry. From the AP: “The $105 million in Foreign Military Financing funds for the Lebanese Armed Forces was released just before the Thanksgiving holiday and lawmakers were notified of the step on Monday, according to two congressional staffers and an administration official. … The money had languished in limbo at the Office of Management and Budget since September although it had already won congressional approval and had overwhelming support from the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council. The White House has yet to offer any explanation for the delay despite repeated queries from Congress.”

-- China is using DNA to map faces as Beijing’s pursuit of control over a Muslim ethnic group continues pushing the rules of science and consent. From the Times: “With a million or more ethnic Uighurs and others from predominantly Muslim minority groups swept up in detentions across Xinjiang, officials in Tumxuk have gathered blood samples from hundreds of Uighurs — part of a mass DNA collection effort dogged by questions about consent and how the data will be used. In Tumxuk, at least, there is a partial answer: Chinese scientists are trying to find a way to use a DNA sample to create an image of a person’s face. The technology, which is also being developed in the United States and elsewhere, is in the early stages of development and can produce rough pictures good enough only to narrow a manhunt or perhaps eliminate suspects. But given the crackdown in Xinjiang, experts on ethics in science worry that China is building a tool that could be used to justify and intensify racial profiling and other state discrimination against Uighurs.”

-- North Korea said that dialogue with the U.S. has been nothing but a “foolish trick” and warned Washington that it could be on the receiving end of an unwelcome Christmas gift. Simon Denyer reports: “The North Korean regime has given the United States until the end of the year to drop its ‘hostile policy,’ come up with a new approach to talks and offer concessions in return for its decision to end nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in 2018. But a recent decision by the United States to postpone a joint air drill with South Korea clearly hasn’t satisfied Pyongyang. Ri Thae Song, vice foreign minister in charge of U.S. affairs, accused Washington of trying to buy time by calling for a ‘sustained and substantial dialogue,’ but he rejected this approach. … ‘The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,’ he said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency. ‘What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.’ North Korea has a history of timing launches with an eye on international developments and even U.S. holidays.”

-- On the first day of the NATO Summit, Trump slammed French President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of NATO as “very, very nasty” and “disrespectful.” Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: Referring to comments Macron made “last month in an interview with The Economist — in which Macron described the ‘brain death’ of NATO due to lack of American support — Trump attacked Macron during his first remarks on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London, calling the comments ‘very insulting.’ ‘You just can’t go around making statements like that about NATO,’ Trump said, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders Tuesday morning. Though Trump himself has long been a vocal critic of NATO — a combative stance that has alarmed Western allies and seemed to prompt Macron’s comments — Trump took umbrage at the French assessment of the alliance, and depicted France as the beneficiary of American largesse. ‘I would say that nobody needs NATO more than France,’ Trump said.”

-- Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pair of bills. One requires all consumer electronic devices sold in the country to be pre-installed with Russian software. Another will require individual journalists to register as foreign agents. From Fox News: “Government officials say the law will help Russian IT firms compete with foreign companies, which dominate Russia’s mobile phone market, Reuters reported. Another law signed by Putin Monday is a bill that gives the government the right to register bloggers, journalists and social media users as foreign agents. The bill is an extension of an existing law adopted in response to the U.S. Justice Department’s 2017 decision to label the Russian state-funded network RT as a foreign agent. The new law applies to anyone who distributes content produced by media outlets registered as foreign agents and receives payments from abroad. Individuals registered as foreign agents will be subject to additional government scrutiny.”

-- The American woman who claims convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with Britain’s Prince Andrew told the BBC that the episodes were “disgusting” and asked for support from the British public. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “‘This is not some sordid sex story, this is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse, and this is a story of your guys’ royalty,’ Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC in an hour-long documentary that aired Monday night. … Giuffre — now 35 and a mother of three — told the BBC that she was passed around to Epstein’s rich and powerful friends ‘like a platter of fruit.’ She said she was trafficked to Andrew three times in 2001 and 2002: once in London at the home of Epstein’s girlfriend, once at Epstein’s New York mansion and once on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. ‘It didn’t last long,’ she said of the first of three alleged encounters with the prince. ‘He got up, and he said thanks, I sat there in bed, just horrified and ashamed and felt dirty,’ Giuffre said.” The prince has denied that he had sex with her.

-- The rape and killing of a veterinarian on her way home from work have shaken India. Joanna Slater reports: “The killing of the 26-year-old veterinarian in the South Indian city of Hyderabad last week has provoked outrage and anguish across India, the latest in a series of gruesome, high-profile crimes against women and girls. Police arrested four men and said they had confessed to the killing. Speaking in Parliament on Monday, India’s defense minister called it an ‘inhuman’ crime that has ‘brought shame to the entire country.’ … After news of the veterinarian’s killing spread, demonstrations erupted in Hyderabad over the weekend. Thousands of people protested at a police station near where the woman’s body was found and outside the gated compound where her family lives. In New Delhi, a young woman was arrested for holding a sign in a high-security area outside Parliament that read, ‘Why can’t I feel safe in my own India?’”

-- The Pacific island nation of Samoa will shut down government services for two days so civil servants can focus on a nationwide immunization drive as the country struggles to end a measles outbreak that has so far claimed more than 50 lives, most of them children. From NPR: “Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi announced the closure on Monday, saying the government is relying on ‘village councils, faith-based organizations, and church leaders, village mayors and government women representatives’ to persuade the public to get vaccinated. As a result, he said, all but public utility government services will be shuttered Dec. 5 and 6. More than 3,700 measles cases have been reported since the outbreak began in October, with 198 recorded within a 24-hour period. Fifty-three people have died and of those, 48 are children under 4 years old.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden may lose the Iowa caucuses. But, by betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas, he may still secure the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. From the Times: “If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests. … While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates. A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters. …

“Some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.) Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates. This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.”

-- In a wide-raging interview aboard the “No Malarkey” bus, the former vice president said he doesn’t need Obama’s endorsement, scoffed at the idea that Elizabeth Warren is building enthusiasm and accused Pete Buttigieg of stealing his plans. From Politico: “Biden reiterated that he asked Obama not to endorse him, and he stuck by that stance even when asked whether he’d want Obama’s backing if the field narrowed to three people. ‘No, because everyone knows I’m close with him,’ Biden said. ‘I don’t need an Obama endorsement.’ … Biden was asked about a POLITICO Magazine article that recently reported how Obama had confided in another candidate that his former vice president ‘really doesn’t have it’ when it comes to an intimate connection with voters. ‘He may have said that. And if it’s true, and he said it, there’s truth to it,’ Biden acknowledged on Monday before saying that he has ‘mostly campaigned for other people in the time I’ve been here. And I’ve never been in a position seeking the nomination where I have had the money and the organization to be able to get open headquarters all over the state.’ …

“Biden lamented media coverage that he said initially dismissed the durability of his candidacy because he was too moderate and didn‘t embrace policies like Medicare for All. Biden said the field was now moving closer to his views and away from the left. When asked whether he unintentionally set the stage for Buttigieg, who is leading in the polls in Iowa, Biden grew animated. ‘Set it up? He stole it! Set it up?’ Biden said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind. … The former vice president then accused the media of going too easy on Buttigieg, saying his opponent had once supported a more liberal health care plan but then pivoted … When asked about another polling leader in Iowa and elsewhere — Warren — Biden dismissed her rise and the notion that she had momentum behind her. ‘Look at the polling everywhere. Tell me. Tell me where the polling has manifested itself,’ he said. ‘She lives in Massachusetts, she’s invested millions and millions of dollars in New Hampshire, why shouldn’t she be known there?’”

-- Three state lawmakers acknowledge that lobbyists helped craft their op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all. Jeff Stein reports: “Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms. Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist. None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.”

-- The Trump campaign denied credentials to journalists from Bloomberg News, accusing the organization of “bias” against the president. Kayla Epstein and Derek Hawkins report: “Bloomberg News faced a journalistic quandary when its owner, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, decided to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary last month. In a widely criticized decision, editor in chief John Micklethwait announced that the newsroom would continue its tradition of not investigating Bloomberg’s personal life and finances, and would extend the same policy to his Democratic opponents. The move was intended to avoid conflict of interest in the Democratic primary. Micklethwait noted, however, that Bloomberg News would continue to investigate the Trump administration. After the Trump campaign announced its decision Monday to bar Bloomberg News, President Trump took to Twitter to attack the news outlet and the New York Times for their coverage of him.”

-- The New York Times is overhauling its traditional closed-door endorsement process for Democratic presidential candidates and will instead conduct interviews with the contenders on the record and air parts of the discussions – along with the editorial board’s final decision – on its show “The Weekly.” (Politico)

-- A month after ending his presidential campaign, Beto O’Rourke is setting his focus on flipping the Texas state house. From the Houston Chronicle: “With Texas Democrats nine seats away from retaking the majority of seats in the Texas House, O’Rourke is trying to convince his donor base to send money to an organization called Flip The Texas House, which has targeted 17 House Districts in which Republican candidates won by fewer than 10 percentage points last year. More than half are districts in which O’Rourke won the majority of votes as he ran for U.S. Senate.”

-- With just a week remaining before the deadline to run for office in Texas next year, some of O’Rourke’s supporters are still hoping to see him jump into the race to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R). They even commissioned a poll that shows he’d sail through the Senate primary were he to join the race. From the Dallas Morning News: “The poll also shows him in a near-tie, trailing Cornyn 46-42 at this point, which is far stronger than others already seeking the nomination. O’Rourke’s campaign operation has gone dormant. He didn’t respond to messages on Monday and hasn’t said lately whether he’s interested. … During his presidential campaign, O’Rourke said flatly and repeatedly that he would not even consider running for the Senate in 2020 … ‘I know it’s a bit of a longshot to try and convince Beto to do this, but it is clear to a lot of people in Texas that that would be the best thing for us,’ said Alan Metni, executive director of the Democratic Policy Institute, the group that commissioned the new poll.""

-- Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp isn’t expected to nominate Rep. Douglas Collins, Trump’s pick, for a soon-to-be-open Senate seat. He’s now facing heavy backlash – including threats of a primary challenge. Seung Min Kim reports: “Kemp is expected to tap business executive Kelly Loeffler for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) … The public outcry against Kemp and Loeffler from Trump allies has led some of them to threaten a primary challenge against the first-term governor, and they have urged the president’s supporters to flood Kemp’s office with calls pushing him not to select Loeffler. … Conservative radio host Mark Levin derided Kemp as ‘another Romney,’ referring to the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and current senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, as he accused the Georgia governor of being on the precipice of appointing a ‘RINO,’ a Republican in name only … The formal announcement from Kemp is expected on Wednesday, the officials said, so as to not interfere with Isakson’s farewell address on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon.”

-- In a big break for Republican hopes of holding the Senate, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) no longer faces a primary challenge in his reelection bid. From the News & Observer: “Raleigh retired businessman Garland Tucker is ending his campaign for the Republican nomination in the U.S. Senate … Tucker invested more than $1.5 million of his own money to challenge Tillis, who is seeking a second term in 2020. Monday marked the beginning of the 2020 filing period in North Carolina. Tucker, who joined the race in May, opted not to file. … The letter cited the attention on the ongoing impeachment inquiry into [Trump] as well as Tillis’ role as one of his defenders in the Senate as a reason for Tucker’s decision to end his campaign.”

-- An outspoken Holocaust denier, activist anti-Semite and white supremacist filed again for a Chicago-area House seat. From the Chicago Sun-Times: “Arthur Jones, of suburban Lyons, won the GOP nomination in 2018 because he was the only Republican on the 3rd District primary ballot. In the general election, he was easily beaten by Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., but received about 26 percent of the vote even after his views were exposed.”

Kamala Harris should have been a contender. In the summer of 2017, the California senator was the toast of the Hamptons and new queen of the Clintonites. From the earliest days of her candidacy, Harris boasted the enthusiastic support of Hillary’s donor network and supporters, warm relations with Obamaworld, and the sympathies of a broad range of Democratic lawmakers in the nation’s largest state and beyond. When Harris withdrew from the race Tuesday, she was second only to Joe Biden in FiveThirtyEight’s “endorsement primary.”

If America’s political parties were still strong enough to anoint their own standard-bearers in smoke-filled rooms (and/or wine-soaked patios), Harris would be on her way to a presidential nomination. Instead, she’s cutting her losses and fortifying her defenses against a hypothetical primary challenge in 2022.

The Democratic Establishment may finally be reconciling itself to Joe Biden. But the former vice-president had to maintain a large lead over the field for months before his party’s donors began moving sharply his way. And even now, significant factions refuse to accept that a 77-year-old white guy who’s rambly beyond his years is their best bet for fending off the Democratic left (thus, we all now know the name of the mayor of South Bend). One reason why Barack Obama tapped Biden as his running mate in the first place was that he was looking for a wingman, not an heir apparent — and the idea of Uncle Joe running for the presidency at age 74 appeared self-evidently absurd. The party’s Pooh-Bahs may settle for an even older Biden, but only if the rank and file leaves them no other choice.

Harris was the one they wanted. She offered oratorical talent, a national political identity still inchoate enough to be remodeled to the demands of the moment, and an opportunity to make history. She appeared progressive enough to appease the left, and pragmatic enough to ease the corporate wing’s economic anxieties. But none of that mattered much, in the end.

Multiple suspects are implicated in Kamala 2020’s premature death. The autopsies began while its heart was still beating: Over the weekend, the New York Times curated the mutual recriminations of her campaign’s warring factions. Whoever was truly at fault, there appears to be little disagreement that her operation was poorly managed. But the Harris team’s idiosyncratic failings can’t explain why Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and other conventionally qualified Democratic candidates have been polling behind her. A separate explanation for Harris’s woes is that, in the Trump era, Democratic voters have developed a more conservative conception of electability than the party’s elites. After the trauma of 2016, perhaps many primary goers feel that nominating an African-American or a woman — let alone an African-American woman — would be tempting fate. But while there is almost certainly some truth to this assessment, it also cannot explain why the two candidates who most violently defy the conventional wisdom about “electability” — the Jewish socialist Bernie Sanders, and female anti-corporate crusader Elizabeth Warren — remain poised to compete in Iowa and beyond.

Thus, Harris’s improbable collapse, along with the failure of Booker or Klobuchar to ever launch, seems indicative of something larger than their individual liabilities — namely, the weakness of modern American political parties as institutions. Booker has won more coveted endorsements than Bernie Sanders, and Klobuchar has claimed more than Pete Buttigieg. But each has mustered only a small fraction of the socialist senator’s or South Bend mayor’s support. Harris’s fundamental problem was that her campaign was rich in a depreciating currency. What looked like the potency of Establishment signaling in 2016 may have actually been the power of mere familiarity: Democratic base voters tend to admire the party’s most prominent leaders, and many are happy to default to a familiar face. For this reason, Biden has managed to coast on name recognition and goodwill. But Establishment support without national renown doesn’t seem to count for much.

In the land of weak parties, mass media is king. Politics Twitter may be wildly unrepresentative of the Democratic electorate. And Harris’s campaign may have erred by failing to appreciate that fact. But her candidacy’s demise reveals that catering to the tastes of the Twitter left is nevertheless perfectly rational. Those bundlers in the Hamptons failed to provide Harris with a steady supply of campaign cash. Sanders’s and Warren’s ideologically motivated, extremely online small-dollar armies by contrast have kept their coffers full. Meanwhile, Buttigieg got off the ground by accepting — and “acing” — absolutely every earned media opportunity that came his way. And in the past week, Michael Bloomberg managed to buy himself the same level of national support as Harris by dropping a recording-breaking $30 million on television ads. In many respects, Donald Trump’s 2016 triumph may prove sui generis. But in demonstrating that media dominance can compensate for a total dearth of intraparty support, the mogul’s first campaign gave us a preview of the new normal.

All of which is to say, the main lesson of Harris’s failure may be this: If you enter a presidential race without celebrity status, unique credibility among your party’s most engaged and ideological activists, billions of dollars in personal wealth, or a preternatural gift for charming white journalists and Iowa grandparents, you are going to have a hard time keeping your campaign funded — no matter how warmly you’re celebrated on Capitol Hill or Martha’s Vineyard."

Biden “is committed to being transparent with the American people about the smart and effective ways he’d pay for the bold changes he’s proposing,” said Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director.

The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.

The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s.

Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.

AD

Biden also opts not to adopt more-aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign, including a new tax on Wall Street transactions.

AD

Similarly, Biden proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent, where it was before the 2017 GOP tax law. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.

“[Biden] continues to carve out for himself an agenda that’s in the single-digit trillions rather than the double-digit trillions,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served as an adviser to Biden when he was vice president, who added the plan was still highly progressive. “That’s designed to appeal to the moderate part of the electorate, and so far that’s worked.”

Biden’s plan is also likely to meet resistance from conservatives for dramatically raising taxes on firms through a number of measures — many of which were also pushed by President Barack Obama.

AD

Even though Biden’s proposal is starkly different than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary, it would further set him apart from the approach President Trump has promised to pursue. Trump has called for following up the $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017 with a new round of tax cuts, which advisers want to market as a boost for the middle class.

Biden’s plan would seek to prevent corporations from taking advantage of the tax code in a way that allows them to avoid paying many taxes. It would set a global minimum tax for companies based in the United States to recapture revenue if they book their profits in low-tax jurisdictions such as Bermuda or Ireland.

AD

It would also cap how much firms can claim in deductions, end loopholes for real estate investors in the tax code and impose sanctions on countries that allow illegal corporate tax avoidance. Biden had backed many of these ideas before this week but not in as much detail as the newly released plan.

AD

While more acceptable to Republicans than the ideas of Sanders and Warren, Biden’s plan would still make the United States the most heavily taxed country for firms in the OECD, when state and local taxes are taken into account, said Brian Riedl, a tax expert at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

Biden’s math is made easier by pitching less dramatic federal programs than his opponents. Sanders and Warren have called for more than $20 trillion of new spending on a Medicare-for-all health-care system that would guarantee free coverage to all Americans.

AD

Biden’s health-care plan, which the campaign says will cost less than $1 trillion, would leave 10 million people without insurance and do far less to rein in high deductibles and premiums faced by millions of Americans.

Sanders has pushed a plan to tackle climate change that would cost $16 trillion, calling for $2 trillion alone as part of a “Green New Deal” on funding to weatherize and retrofit homes and businesses. Biden’s climate change and infrastructure proposal would cost about $1.7 trillion in total.

AD

Biden’s tax plan also says it will raise $750 billion for his higher-education plan, which includes debt-free community college. Warren and Sanders have proposed trillions in new education spending, as well as the elimination or vast reduction of student debt.

“Biden continues to plan the least ambitious federal program of the top-tier candidates,” said Robert C. Hockett, a professor at Cornell University who has provided policy input for Warren and Sanders. “It’s kind of a drop in the bucket given the long-term problems in the economy. It’s small potatoes for a federal plan.”

When Joe Biden turned up in Iowa over the weekend on a tour bus with the words “No Malarkey” splashed across the side, he was sending a message to caucusgoers and his Democratic rivals: No more Mr. Nice Joe.

On Monday the gloves came off, with Biden taking swipes at Pete Buttigieg, his main competition for the moderate vote in Iowa and the beneficiary of a recent surge in support, and Elizabeth Warren, who has dropped in polling but remains strong in the state.

According to Bloomberg News, the former VP invited reporters into the no malarkey zone for an unfiltered question-and-answer session that included Biden accusing Buttigieg of copying his health-care plan, which is centered on creating a public option for anyone who wants it. “He stole it,” Biden said. He also accused reporters of going easy on the South Bend mayor. Biden said that if he had put out a health-care plan that so closely resembled an opponent’s, the press would have “torn my ears off.” He added: “I’d be a plagiarizing no good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.” Biden, of course, has been accused of plagiarism before.

Biden also said Buttigieg “doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderates.” But if Biden’s right about that, it’s hard to imagine why the front-runner would be publicly bashing the 37-year-old Hoosier. Buttigieg has positioned himself as an alternative to Biden for voters who see Warren and Bernie Sanders as too far left, and despite Biden’s protests, moderates in Iowa seem to be buying it.

Biden also hit Warren for a lack of “enthusiasm” in Iowa, Bloomberg News reports:

“You don’t see that with Warren. Stop kidding a kidder. OK, come on, man, give me a break,” Biden said of the Massachusetts senator, who’s drawing large crowds, though she’s fallen from her highs in state and national polls. “Look at the polling everywhere. OK. Tell me. Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself.”

Clearly Biden’s not just done with malarkey. He’s got no time for flimflam, poppycock, or balderdash either."

With the deadline to qualify days away, four white men and two white women have qualified so far, including former vice president Joe Biden, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, billionaire Tom Steyer, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are both nonwhite candidates, each need one more good poll to qualify, whereas Booker, who is black, and former housing secretary Julián Castro haven’t hit 4 percent in any of the required polls. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black, entered the race Nov. 14 and also does not have any qualifying polls.

For many critics, the question was how this historically diverse class of candidates has faded to white — at least on the national debate stage — before February’s Iowa caucuses. To Booker, part of the problem is that this cycle’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying rules are “preferencing millionaires and billionaires.” To Castro, the news media’s narrative on “electability” has also played a role — an issue he cited in part for both Harris’s downfall and the difficulties facing nonwhite candidates vying for a spot on the debate stage.

Harris had qualified for the debate but cited a lack of funds as the main reason for her decision to bow out. In recent weeks, several news stories described internal turmoil and tense disagreements among staffers in her campaign.

Castro pointed to stories in the New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, all of which questioned the health of Harris’s presidential bid after losing its early momentum and running into management issues. But in a videotaped interview posted to Twitter on Tuesday night, Castro argued that the media’s treatment of Harris had been “grossly unfair and unfortunate” and that Harris was held “to a different standard, a higher standard.”

Speaking more generally, he added on Twitter later: “The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” he said. “Our party’s diversity is our strength, and it’s a shame that we’re headed for a December debate without a single person of color.”

Castro’s criticism stems from debate within the Democratic Party about which candidate is most equipped to corral support from a multiracial coalition of voters, as President Barack Obama did, while having the best chance at defeating President Trump. As The Post’s Philip Bump reported in a Tuesday analysis, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the most capable of beating Trump, according to a November Post-ABC News poll.

In a fundraising video Tuesday, Castro said he was still a few thousand donors away from meeting the DNC’s donor requirements for qualifying for the debate. The rules also require candidates to score in four approved polls over 4 percent, or two early-state polls over 6 percent, and to have 200,000 unique donors plus a minimum of 800 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins, who also previously worked on former Democratic congressman John Delaney’s presidential campaign, told Fox News that he believed the DNC’s rules “ended up hurting” the campaigns of candidates like Castro, Harris and Booker because campaigns must spend “insane amounts” of money on donor lists to meet the requirement. He worried that not having a person of color onstage would affect turnout, particularly among African American voters.

Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that advocates for electing women of color, said she worried about whether the candidates on the debate stage would resonate with black female voters. “It’s a sad state of affairs to have six white candidates onstage, many of whom don’t necessarily speak with black women — who are the powerhouse voters,” she told MSNBC on Tuesday.

Like Booker, Castro, in his fundraising video, also criticized wealthier candidates who “basically buy their way onto this debate stage.” In a fundraising email of her own, Warren attacked billionaires Steyer and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, another recent addition to the Democratic race, while lamenting Harris’s departure.

“Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand — two women senators who, together, won more than 11.5 million votes in their last elections — have been forced out of this race, while billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg have been allowed to buy their way in,” Warren wrote. “Running for president shouldn’t be a passion project for bored billionaires.""

But some Republicans mocked Democrats’ concern that the field of candidates on the debate stage may be all white. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) made a quip on Twitter that critics called racist. Linking to a tweet listing the all-white lineup for the debate, Cheney wrote: “You forgot Pocahontas.” Using a favorite Trump nickname, Cheney was referring to Warren, who apologized earlier this year for identifying as Native American during her law career. (A spokesman for Cheney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment in response to the backlash.)

Others pointed out that Harris’s campaign faltered because of other problems, such as her record as a prosecutor. On Tuesday, Harris said she was “still very much in this fight.”

When Trump said he would “miss” her in an apparently facetious tweet, Harris responded: “Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial.”

Tom Steyer’s presidential campaign wasn’t born on third base. Unlike some other Democratic candidates, the humble hedge-fund manager didn’t enter the 2020 race with national name recognition, his own journalistic empire, or a multibillion-dollar personal fortune. In fact, Steyer’s wealthiest intraparty rival could afford to buy up every last thing he owns more than 30 times over.

And yet, through hard work, determination, and $63 million in television ad buys, this salt-of-the-earth, single-digit billionaire has earned his place on the Democratic debate stage in December, while Michael “Moneybags” Bloomberg has not.

To qualify for Blue America’s next oratorical smackdown in Los Angeles, candidates had to either hit 4 percent in four national polls approved by the DNC, or 6 percent in two early primary-state polls, while also securing campaign contributions from at least 200,000 donors. Steyer had already assembled the necessary polls before this week. And on Tuesday morning, his campaign announced that it had cleared the donor threshold.

Steyer is the seventh candidate to qualify for the December debate stage, where he will join Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. Other candidates have until December 12 to hit their marks.

Bloomberg, for his part, appears poised to outshine Steyer in their vote-buying contest. Last week, the megabillionaire (whose net worth is estimated at $54.6 billion, dwarfing Steyer’s piddling $1.6 billion) launched a $30 million ad blitz, the most expensive single week of campaign advertising in the history of presidential primaries.

Ads work, at least to a point.

In return, Bloomberg saw his support in national polls more than double to over 5 percent. Morning Consult’s tracking poll currently puts Bloomberg in a tie for fifth place with Kamala Harris; Steyer, meanwhile, is in a four-way tie for eighth with 2 percent support. But the former New York mayor has sworn off all campaign contributions, and is thus incapable of qualifying for any of the remaining Democratic debates, barring a change in the rules. And although Steyer is not registering much in national polls, in the early primary states — which he has inundated with paid messaging — Morning Consult has him at 9 percent, just three points behind Elizabeth Warren."

Kamala Harris has dropped out. Cory Booker hasn’t qualified for December’s debate. Julián Castro missed November’s and is polling between zero and one percent nationally. At various points, all three were considered heirs apparent to the voting bloc that lifted Barack Obama to victory. And all three are strong arguments for why the vaunted “Obama coalition” might’ve been the ex-president’s alone.

Conventional wisdom has long held that re-creating Obama’s path to the White House hinged on building a base out of Northern whites, young people, and energized black and Latino voters. The last debate saw Harris and Booker each cast themselves as the candidate best equipped to accomplish this. “We’ve got to re-create the Obama coalition to win,” Harris said. “[Nobody] on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters,” said Booker. Neither has built a convincing case for themselves. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has consistently led polls of Democratic primary voters, including black and Latino ones, and most maneuvering from his nonwhite challengers has been aimed at undermining his dominance. A senescent white centrist might seem an unlikely inheritor of Obama’s supporters, but Biden is well on his way. “I’m part of that Obama coalition,” the 77-year-old said at the debate. “I have more people supporting me, in the black community, that have announced for me, because they know me. They know who I am.”

Almost every political figure upon whom pols and pundits have bestowed the “next Obama” moniker has traits in common: They’re invariably young, almost always nonwhite (Beto O’Rourke, who earned early plaudits from the ex-president, was a rare exception), and have an inspiring but necessarily vague message aimed at flattering their countrymen’s better angels. They embody the shifting demographics that strategists believe will define the electorate of the future: nonwhite with fluency navigating a multiracial milieu without making its occupants feel at odds. But Trump’s election has altered this calculus. White voters who dabbled in multiracial democracy during the Obama years have proven equally enticed by a white supremacist. In 2020, voters repulsed by Trump are less interested in making history and electing some nebulous candidate for America’s diverse future. They want to beat Trump. And most seem to have decided that a challenger whose case for electability is a superficial resemblance to Obama isn’t their best bet.

This isn’t to say that Harris, Booker, and Castro don’t have qualities that recommend them. Castro in particular has distinguished himself with his thoughtful platform aimed at poor people, undocumented immigrants, and the criminalized and incarcerated; Booker has the Trump era’s signature piece of bipartisan legislation under his belt with the First Step Act; and Harris has shined during adversarial exchanges with Republicans in Senate hearings. But it stands to reason that a person seeking to recapture the so-called Obama coalition should bear more than a passing resemblance to the man himself. And none come close: The ex-president’s mix of charisma, rhetorical skill, political savvy, and intelligence remain unparalleled in today’s Democratic Party, and make him a singular figure in modern politics regardless of racial background. His success was also specific to its time. Much of the American public had soured on George W. Bush’s leadership and warmongering by 2008, and Obama not only represented the most striking contrast, he was one of the few senators in the race who hadn’t voted for the Iraq War. (He was not yet in the Senate at the time, but spoke out against the war beforehand.) This gave him an air of legitimacy with progressive voters that Booker and Harris — with their evangelism for charter schools and work as a prosecutor, respectively — are missing. Both were left with a narrow path to the nomination: Either convince black voters and white moderates that they were surer bets than Biden in the general election, or prove to progressives that their bona fides belied a pragmatism and diverse appeal that made them viable alternatives to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

None of it has worked. Their presumed constituencies have found their preferred candidates elsewhere. Older black voters have gravitated to Biden, with his political longevity and vows to preserve Obama’s legislative legacy, while younger black voters have been drawn to the structural change and revolutionary fervor peddled by Warren and Sanders, respectively. Hampering Booker, Harris, and Castro’s cases further was a lack of clarity regarding why an electorate that just backed Trump would suddenly be enticed by a less-galvanizing echo of his predecessor, the black president whose legacy Trump vowed to negate. Voters in 2020 won’t have suddenly lost their susceptibility to the president’s racist charms. And few on the Democratic side are willing to submit a candidate whose appeal to white people with questionable racial politics is dubious or unproven.

Given the Democratic electorate’s consuming desire to oust Trump, it’s unclear if Obama himself could’ve made it out of the 2020 primary. The eventual president trailed Hillary Clinton among even black voters in 2008 until he proved he could win overwhelmingly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prospect of continued Republican governance is threat enough today that risk aversion is at a premium. Many voters — and black voters in particular — agree that it’s no time to roll the dice on an unknown quantity, as Obama would’ve been considered. This is by no means a universal consensus. The success of Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns suggest an appetite for democratic socialism that would upend the status quo. Pete Buttigieg is overperforming as a small-city mayor. Andrew Yang has built a coalition that, while almost negligibly small, has generated consistently higher polling numbers than either Booker or Castro.

But generally speaking, the assumption that nonwhite candidates would be best positioned to rebuild Obama’s coalition by virtue of their shared nonwhiteness and a handful of other superficial parallels hasn’t borne out. Democrats instead have thus far coalesced behind a white septuagenarian who fought against busing, implied that every black candidate before Obama was “unclean,” and had at least one other presidential campaign end ignominiously. They’ve done so largely because Biden is well-known and well-liked, has personal ties to the white Rust Belt voters who helped deliver Trump’s win in 2016, and boasts goodwill among liberal voters generated by his affiliation with Obama, who was extremely popular. Simply put, they think he’s the guy that the widest range of voters can agree on. And if this is the conclusion they’ve drawn a mere three years after Obama exited the White House, it’s worth asking whether his coalition, activated by a candidate with a profile similar to his own, was more fluky confluence of circumstances than replicable political strategy.

The Republican Party lives off the largess of the welfare state’s worst enemies — and the votes of its primary beneficiaries. In 2016, Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump by more than 20 points with voters under 45. Absent the resilient Republicanism and superlative turnout rate of America’s seniors, the mogul would have lost the Electoral College in a landslide.

The president and his party become grown no less dependent on the outsize support of “gray America” in the years since. Trump’s disapproval rating among Americans under 35 hovers around 70 percent. Less than a third of millennials wanted Republicans to retain control of Congress last year. Meanwhile, in broader measures of generational opinion, both millennials and Gen-Zers evince higher levels of support for liberal ideological premises and policy proposals than any older cohorts. And these aberrantly socialist generations will represent a larger share of the electorate with each passing cycle; in 2018, millennial, Gen-Z, and Gen-X voters collectively cast more ballots than their elders for the first time ever in a midterm election.

Thus the GOP appears poised to grow increasingly reliant on the support of older voters, even as those voters grow evermore dependent on on social-welfare programs: In the coming decades, millions of younger boomers will age into eligibility for Medicare and Social Security, while millions of older ones will develop a need for long-term care. Whether the GOP can keep these graying boomers satisfied — while meeting its obligations to the anarcho-capitalist billionaires who are the party’s top shareholders (and the movement conservative ideologues who are its top functionaries) — may determine its electoral viability in 2020 and beyond.

To this point, the GOP has managed to finesse its internal contradictions by slow-walking its ambitions for Medicare and Social Security, portraying all other transfer programs as a threat to older Americans’ hard-earned benefits, and/or baldly lying about where the two parties actually stood on entitlements. In 2012, Paul Ryan excoriated the Obama administration for its (nonexistent) cuts to Medicare benefits. Four years later, Trump campaigned on a promise to oppose all cuts to entitlement spending. This mendacious messaging, combined with the Democratic Party’s own flirtations with “entitlement reform,” helped to decrease the salience of seniors’ favorite socialist programs in national elections.

Fortunately, the Democratic Party is no longer locked in a (figurative) ménage à trois with “Simpson and Bowles.” Now, instead of promising Grand Bargains on the deficit, or the mere maintenance of existing entitlements, Democrats are pushing to expand benefits for America’s seniors (which is the one proposal for welfare-state expansion that Republicans can’t paint as a threat to seniors’ benefits). All of the leading contenders for the party’s 2020 nomination have endorsed increasing Social Security benefits. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, have endorsed “universal long-term care” as part of their proposals for health-care reform. And last week, Pete Buttigieg unveiled his “Gray New Deal” — a package of new benefits for seniors that includes an expansion of Social Security, a “Public Option 401(k),” and a means-tested entitlement to long-term care.

The Democrats’ leftward lurch on socialism for seniors is right on the merits: Owing in part to gains in life expectancy among the elderly, an American turning 65 today has somewhere between a 50 and 70 percent chance of eventually requiring long-term support by the end of his or her life. And yet, the U.S. is nearly alone among wealthy nations in lacking a universal long-term-care benefit. What’s more, as James Medlock and Colin McAuliffe of Data for Progress note, the U.S. spends far less on long-term care (as a percentage of its GDP) than the vast majority of OECD countries.

If the federal government does not step in and provide more funding for home health-care workers and quality live-in facilities, then millions of older Americans will be at risk of spending their “golden years” in conditions of harrowing deprivation, while millions of younger Americans will see their own ambitions compromised by the burdens of caring for their elders.

But even if expanding social support for the elderly weren’t good policy, it would remain indispensably good politics. Increasing Social Security benefits and creating a new entitlement to long-term care are both overwhelmingly popular. In a recent survey, Tufts University and Data for Progress (DFP) told respondents, “Some Democrats have proposed spending $120 billion per year to provide seniors with comprehensive long-term-care benefits through Medicare” and that this policy would require raising payroll taxes by 1.5 percent and that Republicans say “American workers are already taxed too much and that increasing government spending is irresponsible.” The pollsters then asked respondents whether they supported the proposal. Remarkably, despite the explicit partisan framing and Republican counterargument, 60 percent of registered voters endorsed the proposal, while only 27 opposed it. What’s more, support for the plan was higher among boomers than among younger generations.

Support for expanding Social Security is even broader. A separate DFP poll of Warren’s plan for increasing Social Security benefits (by raising taxes on the rich) found 76 percent of respondents endorsing the idea, including 67 percent of Republican voters. Finally, a variety of proposals for aggressive government intervention to bring down pharmaceutical prices command supermajority support.

Conservatives have no politically viable rationale for rejecting these ideas. But they also have no ideological room to maneuver. Trump has tried his best to triangulate on prescription drugs. But Senate Republicans won’t let him. As Politico reported Sunday, most of McConnell’s caucus is refusing to embrace Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley’s milquetoast prescription-drug bill, on the grounds that some of its provisions amount to “government price controls.” In the estimation of the median Republican senator, conservatives are duty-bound to oppose “federal intervention when it comes to the cost of prescription drugs.” Such objections might have resonance at a meeting of the Federalist Society. But there simply is no mass constituency that takes more offense at the abstract concept of “price controls” than they do at price-gouging drug companies. (And, of course, Republicans do not actually oppose “federal intervention” in the prescription drug market; the high prices of prescription drugs in the U.S. derive from the unusual generosity of our nation’s government-granted patent monopolies, which GOP lawmakers are fighting tooth and nail to protect.)

The GOP’s helplessness in the face of a “Gray New Deal” is further confirmed by the Wall Street Journal editorial board’s takedown of Pete Buttigieg’s version of that agenda. The paper lambastes Mayor Pete for trying to buy seniors’ votes and warns its readers that his plan would require raising taxes on “all high-income” Americans “from $250,000 to infinity.” This attack line may play well with the 2 percent of the voting-eligible public that earns more than a quarter-million dollars a year. But it’s unlikely to strike a chord with the median elderly voter.

America is in dire need of a wide variety of progressive reforms. And there are strong arguments against prioritizing new benefits for seniors over action on climate change or health care or voting rights, when and if Democrats retake the White House and Senate. But before worrying about exactly how they should wield power, progressives will first need to win it. And in both the primary and general elections, left-wing candidates have both an urgent need to increase their support among seniors and more to offer those voters than any of their rivals. Americans who cannot support themselves on market income — and are in acute need for affordable drugs and medical service — have no better friend than the progressive movement and no worse enemy than the Republican Party. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren should do everything they can to make older Democratic primary voters see that. And next fall, the Democratic Party should do everything in its power to make the 2020 election into a referendum on a “Gray New Deal.”"

That got some laughter from the crowd, 350 or so Iowans out to see a candidate whose “front-runner” status had evaporated sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving. Warren was serious. Out was the finely crafted stump speech, with reminiscences of her mother putting on her Sunday best (“you all know the dress”) and working to save her family. Out were the applause lines about how “unions will rebuild the middle class” and how the Supreme Court should follow “basic standards of ethics.”

Instead, Warren talked for a fast eight minutes, then took questions for an hour — impeachment, Medicare-for-all, impeachment again, and whether there was a moment in her life “where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn't accept you as much.” After steadily losing support to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren was working to remind Iowans why they'd liked her in the first place: She was the candidate with plans. Remember that?

The Marion town hall, followed by an event in Iowa City where she continued the ask-anything format, was Warren's way of acknowledging that something had gone wrong. She would never say so outright. Warren's campaign has avoided talk about the horse race or its plan of attack, even in better days.

Over the summer, when an Iowa poll found Warren leading for the first time, her campaign told staff not to talk about it, and they obliged, a dogma that continued through the year. Reporters who get time with Warren, usually in short gaggles after her town halls, have learned that any horse race question will get a happy non-answer about why the senator is “in this fight” or why she isn't paying attention to polls.

“No,” Warren told reporters in Iowa City, when asked whether she was adjusting her campaign after a downswing. “This is a chance to just talk to more people, and hear their questions, and field more questions. I've been fielding questions since the very first event I did right at the beginning in Iowa.”

It's true that Warren has done this before; it's also true that she's shaking things up. As it rose, Warren's campaign refused to engage with most negative attacks, not even dispatching surrogates for cable TV segments. Warren herself avoided TV interviews, ignored Sunday talk shows and seldom responded to the (often-Trump-centric) news of the day.

There are signs of change, with Warren expected to sit for several cable interviews this week and top surrogates such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts expected to do more TV work as the impeachment drama continues. The Marion town hall produced one of Warren's first viral moments in weeks, when she comforted a member of the LGBTQ community with an emotional story about her divorce.

That was new. Warren's media strategy until Marion had come with disadvantages, exacerbated by her support for Medicare-for-all, which she opted to defend conceptually and funded with a complicated mix of tax increases on the wealthy and employers. Four years earlier, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) challenged Hillary Clinton from the left, not a single negative ad ran in Iowa about his health-care plan, and Sanders did not release an outline for Medicare-for-all until two weeks before the caucuses. This year, attacks on the least popular aspect of Medicare-for-all began six months before anyone would vote.

Over the summer, the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of insurers, bought half of all political advertising in Iowa. As the leaves changed, Buttigieg and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado both began running ads that emphasized how they would expand government insurance coverage without touching private insurance — unlike Warren, or Sanders. The ads did not mention specific candidates, but the splashback hit Warren, who did not counterpunch unless directly attacked.

In mid-November, Warren partially broke with Sanders with her own transition plan, which would delay the end of private insurance. The attacks didn't stop, and the battle did damage that the campaign knew it needed to reverse. In Marion, she packed her plan for Medicare into three tight minutes: using executive powers to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, using budget reconciliation to lower the enrollment age and pull millions of people into the system, then teeing up a battle with weakened insurance companies.

“I think America is going to say: I'm on board, I get it, I like how this works,” Warren said. “I think that is how we're going to get the most help early in the process, and we're going to be able to open it up. So, it's not about fighting among Americans; it's about how to get health care to every single American at the lowest possible cost.”

One word in that answer — “fighting” — got to Warren's problem. Until her opponents zeroed in on Medicare-for-all, Warren was most strongly identified with her plan for an incremental wealth tax (“two cents, two cents”) that paid for an expansive liberal agenda without asking the vast majority of Americans to pay more. Instead of arguing with any primary opponents, Warren was arguing with billionaires, which she relished. In October and November, she was arguing with fellow Democrats, which she didn't, and Buttigieg flourished by both criticizing Warren's tone and by promising not to get wrapped up in “fighting.”

That has pulled voters away from Warren, sometimes visibly; there were empty seats in a Sunday afternoon event in Waterloo, which drew 175 people in a reliably Democratic town. (Terrance Hollingsworth, who'd organized a summer house party for Warren, said she shouldn't have come to the black part of Waterloo while many voters were at church.) Warren had kicked off the weekend with a rally of around 3,000 supporters in Chicago, which quieted the talk of a fade-out.

Warren's voters were paying attention to the setbacks. At Sunday's events, some used words such as “uncomfortable” to describe how Warren had handled attacks on her policies, though some added that they wanted to see a woman in the White House. (The surprise exit from the race by Sen. Kamala D. Harris has increased the chance that Warren would be the last woman standing in Iowa.) In Waterloo, Ken and Mary Huffman, both 69, were divided — Ken was all in on Warren, while Mary had been dismayed by the Medicare conversation.

“I like what Buttigieg is saying, especially his Medicare for those who want it,” said Mary Huffman. “I've read that there are concerns about whether her plan is enough to pay for that.” Warren's eventual payment and transition plans, she said, had “swayed” her, but not enough to pick a side of the fence.

It's Buttigieg, not Sanders, who Warren-world sees as her biggest problem in Iowa. The Sanders campaign shares that theory, seeing no threat to itself from Buttigieg's more comfortable, college-educated and white coalition, in Iowa or elsewhere. Warren's campaign, with eight weeks to turn things around, is watching to see whether Buttigieg can hold up to scrutiny; while that happens, it's working to restore the image Warren had over the summer as the candidate who could plan for anything and answer any question. It wouldn't abandon the “fight” framing, even as Buttigieg seemed to gain by attacking it.

“It is easy to give up on big ideas,” Warren said. “It makes you sound smart and sophisticated: Just give up on the big ideas! But when we give up on the big ideas, we give up on the people who would be touched by those ideas. Most people are already in a fight.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who ended her campaign for the presidency Tuesday, was not like other Democrats who'd dropped out. She had 15 endorsements from members of Congress — 16, before the resignation of California's Katie Hill. She'd made inroads with local leaders and elected Democrats across early states. In two weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the loudest liberal voices in the party, was set to campaign for her in Iowa.

That seemed natural, more natural than the slow, brutal collapse of her campaign. At the start of this decade, when Elizabeth Warren was teaching at Harvard and Pete Buttigieg had just left McKinsey & Co., Harris was seen as a potential president, a “female Obama” whose Jamaican and Indian heritage made her intriguing to an increasingly diverse party.

What happened next was a classic political tragedy, a rise and rise and rise followed by a steep fall. Even Democrats who wanted to beat Harris had mixed feelings about what was happening. Harris was labeled a “cop” for a criminal justice record that was dissected for steps that angered activists (an anti-truancy policy that arrested parents, more than 1,000 marijuana convictions) while other moves (opposition to the death penalty that nearly cost her an election) were forgotten. Harris was the first of many Democrats to get whipsawed by the details of Medicare-for-all, and propose some changes to it, which hurt her in ways it never hurt Pete Buttigieg or Elizabeth Warren.

Even some of Harris's setbacks sat uneasily with some Democrats. Her problems began early, with an in-public struggle to define why she was running, and some high-profile events, such as She the People's summit in Houston and the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco, where she gave unmemorable answers or speeches.

But Harris had surged in the polls after criticizing Joe Biden's previous opposition to busing, which ended up showing how resilient Biden's black support really was — a problem for every one of his rivals. Her worst onstage moment came when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii unloaded on her California record, which turned Gabbard into a favorite of Republicans, encouraging her to go on the attack in later debates. (The Trump campaign quickly congratulated Gabbard after Harris's announcement; Gabbard herself tweeted that “while we disagree on some issues, we agree on others and I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people.”)

By November, Harris was not seen as a threat to the highest-polling Democrats, but her departure mattered in two big ways.

Harris had more legislative endorsements than any Democrat except Joe Biden, and more of them from nonwhite legislators. Those supporters, and some who were staying neutral to see whether Harris could recover, are now free agents, getting fresh overtures from rival campaigns. (One congressional endorser texted The Post about his plans with an emoji of a confused person shrugging.) Endorsements have not driven many votes in this primary, but Harris's included Rep. Barbara Lee, a leader of the party's left who once urged Bernie Sanders to run for president, and an army of local elected officials in California, where no Democrat has a clear advantage.

Harris was also the only nonwhite candidate who had qualified for December's debate in her home state, something that quickly dawned on activists and elected officials. The most diverse contest in presidential history, a race that once featured more women than men, had gotten very white. Two nonwhite Democrats are close to making the stage (Andrew Yang and, in a small irony, Tulsi Gabbard), but Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is not. Neither is former HUD secretary Julián Castro, who was cut from November's debate and was one of the first Democrats to defend Harris.

“The way that the media treated Senator Harris in this campaign has been something else,” Castro told CBS News reporter Tim Perry on Tuesday. “In the last few days, to see articles out of Politico, the New York Times, Washington Post, that have basically trashed her campaign and focused on just one small part of it, and I think held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate.”

Those articles had accurately conveyed the problems that ended Harris's campaign: muddled messaging, uncertain leadership and some scheduling errors that got noticed by activists and donors. But in the final weeks of her candidacy, Harris's stump speech had asked why nonwhite or female candidates were seen as less “electable” by voters still stunned by Donald Trump's 2016 win. Harris would tell voters that she was called unelectable in “every race that I have — here is the operative word — won.” On Tuesday afternoon, Democrats angry that the debate rules, demanding increasingly high poll numbers and donations for entry, had let the wealthy Tom Steyer onstage while excluding talented nonwhite candidates.

“That debate stage currently will not look like America,” said former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan.

“No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic,” said Leah Greenberg, the co-founder of the left-wing organizing group Indivisible. “We need leaders who represent the diversity of our party. The myth of 'electability' and the bias associated with it has done huge damage this cycle.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Amy Klobuchar, “Questions.” The senator from Minnesota's first spots in Iowa and New Hampshire portrayed her as a moderate who could unite the country and calm things down. Her new ad gets into one of the Democrats' most popular policies, using government power to flatten the costs of prescription drugs, without getting into the details. The message is more like the one typically deployed by populists: Drug companies get away with murder, sometimes literally, because no one stands up to them. “Why do drug companies make billions of dollars getting people hooked on opioids?” she asks. “The big pharmaceutical companies, they think they own Washington. Well, they don’t own me.”

Pete Buttigieg, “Welcomed Me.” The mayor's first South Carolina ad is the latest in a series that uses footage from his speech to the Liberty and Justice Celebration in Iowa. It recycles a Bible quote that other Democrats have used, but Buttigieg has really grabbed onto: “In our White House, you won’t have to shake your head and ask yourself, “Whatever happened to ‘I was hungry and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me?' ” There are more black voters pictured on-screen than in previous Buttigieg spots, but as part of a diverse mix.

Kamala Harris wasn't the only Democrat to bow out of the Democratic race this week. On Monday, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced the end of his own campaign, saying in a statement that he “won’t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field.” To the consternation of Washington Democrats, who had urged him to forgo this race and run for Senate, he said he was seeking no other office.

Bullock had spent more than a year setting up a run, making stops in Iowa for local Democrats and fixating on a simple, consistent message: He’d won three elections in a red state, unlike literally everyone else running for president.

His biggest problem was that they actually started running for president, months before he did. Bullock, a Democrat presiding over a Republican legislature that meets for only a few months, spent the winter and spring of 2019 pushing through an extension of the state’s Medicaid expansion. When he declared his candidacy in May, he’d already missed out on months of organizing and fundraising.

Iowans did not seem care about that, and Bullock attracted sizable crowds in his first visits to the state. But he never broke through in a race in which Joe Biden, despite some stumbles, held onto a pile of moderate votes, and in which Pete Buttigieg had a head start, a compelling pitch — lighter on accomplishments, heavier on inspiration. Bullock’s one moment in the national spotlight, the second Democratic debate, was a missed opportunity, where he became part of a blur of low-polling candidates warning the party not to go far to the left.

Michael F. Bennet. He declared a sort of solidarity with Bullock after the governor ended his campaign, condemning DNC debate rules for leaving candidates like them (who have not reached the donor or polling thresholds) outside. “The fight to win back voters who abandoned our party for Donald Trump isn’t hopeless,” Bennet said. “It runs through battle-tested candidates from swing states, who know how to meet Americans where they are — not where the loudest voices on social media think they ought to be. It’s unfortunate that the DNC couldn’t make room for a perspective like that.”

Amy Klobuchar. She won over Iowa state Rep. Bruce Bearinger, who had previously endorsed Bullock.

Elizabeth Warren. She released a “fair workweek” plan, spelling out new labor rights for workers with variable schedules. Among the rules: requiring employers to give at least two weeks of notice on scheduling, family leave benefits for some part-time workers, and regulations that would prevent employers from taking advantage of those same part-time workers.

Joe Biden. He picked up the support of California Rep. Ami Bera, shortly before Harris left the race. (As noted above, that will free up a large number of California endorsers.)

Mike Bloomberg. He traveled to Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday for a criminal justice reform meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who has worked with Bernie Sanders but is neutral in the primary.

Cory Booker. He's returning to Iowa around this weekend's multiple cattle calls for an expansive “lead with love” tour.

Tom Steyer. He qualified for the December debate in Los Angeles by reaching more than 200,000 unique donations.

ON THE TRAIL

OKATIE, S.C. — On Sunday, in Iowa, Joe Biden told NBC News that he would not get into an argument with Pete Buttigieg. “Anything I say about Pete will be taken as maybe criticism or a negative about Pete,” Biden said. “I don’t have any negative feelings about Pete at all. I think he’s a talented guy.”

Twenty-four hours later, something changed. In an interview with the reporters following his ""No Malarkey"" tour, Biden scoffed at the idea that Buttigieg's ""Medicare for all who want it"" had caught on, saying he ""stole"" the plan from Biden's similar public option and Medicare buy-in.

“What would you have done to me? You would have torn my ears off,” Biden said. “I would be a plagiarizing, no-good, old man who did bum-bum-bum.”

Buttigieg, who has grappled with other Democrats, declined to spar with Biden. Speaking with reporters after a forum with Latino voters, Buttigieg said only that the former vice president was mistaken.

“I've been talking about Medicare for all who wanted since at least February,” Buttigieg said, “and also, the plans are not exactly the same. You know, we've got to focus on capping out-of-pocket costs and focus on a glide path that I think very well could lead to a Medicare-for-all environment. Of course, I believe that our approach on health care is the best one. And I'm willing to bring that plan out and compete with any of my competitors on having the best plan.”

Pressed again on what it meant that Biden went negative, Buttigieg said that it meant “that we've got an excellent plan.”

Biden's criticism stood out largely because it was new. The four highest-polling Democrats are now split, two and two, on whether America's mixed health-insurance system should be replaced by universal Medicare. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren favor replacement (one over four years, one only after Medicare is expanded to a near-universal program), and had scrapped with both Biden and Buttigieg. And Buttigieg still has more of an argument with the liberal senators; asked whether his plan would cover noncitizens, as Medicare-for-all does, he said it was more complicated.

“I do think that everybody should be eligible to buy in to Medicare for all who wanted the public plan,” Buttigieg said. “But I would expect that you'd have to be a citizen to qualify for subsidies.”

There are a number of reasons to which you could point to explain her difficulties. According to reports, her campaign was hampered by disorganization and mismanagement. Her fundraising couldn’t keep pace with that of other candidates such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She struggled with questions about her record as a prosecutor and her health-care plan (which was perfectly reasonable but didn’t slot neatly into the public option vs. Medicare-for-all conflict to which the debate is often reduced). It’s also hard to say whether her race and gender hurt her ability to amass support, and if so, how much.

One problem, though, stands out: As appealing as she may have been in many ways, Harris was never able to explain why she was running for president. It’s an answer you’d expect every candidate to know long before they make their announcement speech, but a surprising number of them don’t. The winner, though, almost always does.

Of course, we know that the real answer for every candidate, at least in part, is “I’m running for president because I want to be president.” If you think even highly ideological candidates such as Sanders aren’t fiercely ambitious, you’re fooling yourself.

AD

AD

But to stand the best chance at success, a presidential campaign has to be about something. Joe Biden is running to reset the clock to four years ago and restore civility and reason to our politics, his own version of “Make America Great Again.” Warren is running to end corruption and take power away from the plutocrats warping the system for their own ends. But why was Harris running? She never told us, at least not in a way that was clear and concise enough for voters to grasp.

To be clear, there are candidates still in the race who still haven’t told us. And as much as I hesitate to say they should pander to our ""10-second sound bite” culture, it’s not an unreasonable thing to demand that candidates should be able to communicate in a sentence or two what their candidacy represents. It’s particularly important during a primary when the policy distinctions between the candidates are relatively small compared with what they will be in the general election. Voters have to know who the candidates are, but they also have to know what voting for you says about them.

Like many, I’m sorry to see Harris leave the race (though she’ll be around for some time; she’s only 55). It’s particularly disconcerting that she was the only nonwhite candidate to have qualified for the next debate; an all-white debate is not exactly a good look for the party where most nonwhite voters reside.

“What would you have done to me? Torn my ears off. Absolutely. I’d be a plagiarizing, no-good old man,” Biden told reporters, seeming to allude, in one sentence, to the plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential bid and the nagging questions this time about his age.

The “No Malarkey” tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.

“I’m going to say something that I believe to be self-serving, and maybe it is,” Biden told voters in Emmetsburg, Iowa, on Monday. “In all those states we have to win, I do pretty well. . . . So, folks, I believe I can beat Donald Trump. I believe we will beat Donald Trump. I believe Donald Trump believes I will beat Donald Trump.”

Venting his anger

But the tour has also at times served as a bit of a release valve for weeks of seemingly pent-up frustration.

After stumbling in 1988, Biden endured another failed White House bid 20 years later when his 2008 candidacy was overshadowed by the electrifying primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And now Biden has been unable to put away opponents with shorter résumés and, in his view, a lesser chance of defeating Trump.

AD

On Monday, as Biden’s caravan traveled from a stop in northern Iowa to the airport, where he was jetting off for an evening of fundraising in New York before resuming the tour, he invited a group of reporters onto the bus for an unusually expansive conversation. At times, the exchange felt more like an airing of grievances, with Biden waving off staff members who noted he was going over the 30-minute agreed-upon time limit.

AD

“Look at the polling everywhere,” he said in response to a question about Warren. “Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself. She lives in Massachusetts. She’s advertising millions and millions in New Hampshire. Why shouldn’t she be known there?”

When it was pointed out that thousands of Warren supporters had come to see the senator recently in Chicago, he became incredulous.

AD

“Chicago. Oh, great, a great showing in Chicago. Look, guys, you always want to give me numbers but never want to apply numbers to them.”

He said the media’s bias toward Warren was evident as she shifted her stance on Medicare-for-all. Warren had embraced the single-payer plan trumpeted by Sanders. But last month, she pivoted to a more centrist idea: delaying the implementation of Medicare-for-all by three years. In the interim, health-care consumers could opt in to a government plan. But Biden said the media didn’t fully interrogate Warren about how much her initial Medicare-for-all plan would cost.

AD

“How many times did the press ask how much it will cost,” Biden said. “She never answered, because you kept talking about how she’s rising.”

AD

The electability argument

Biden said he felt he’d been fighting against another hurdle: the perception that he was too moderate for a Democratic Party that had become more liberal following Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016.

“What happened after Hillary. [People said,] ‘Guess what, man, the party has turned so far left. So far left, man. And you just can’t win, no one can possibly win, not in that lane.’ Now, and I was the one, remember all the debates in the beginning, ‘Biden is the moderate. Biden’s not progressive enough.’ ”

But now, he noted, other candidates have embraced a more moderate view on health care — adopting what he called the “Biden plan,” preserving the Affordable Care Act and giving the public an option to join a government program.

AD

AD

“I said it then, I’ll say it again, Medicare-for-all ain’t going anywhere, period, because there’s a thing called truth in getting there,” Biden said.

The “No Malarkey” theme, emblazoned in big white letters spread across Biden’s blue motor coach, comes from one of Biden’s favorite expressions. It’s another way of saying “straight talk,” which became the calling card for similar bus caravans that helped define the political brand of a longtime Biden friend, the late Republican Sen. John McCain.

The tour is an attempt to form connections with a larger swath of Iowans, particularly in rural areas, Biden said. It stretches through eight days and more than 660 miles.

AD

At times early on, Biden sounded hoarse or dabbed at his nose during a taxing long weekend of town halls and small-town pit stops. Staffers kept a glass of water tucked near any lectern where he was speaking. His speeches were short by Biden standards, around 20 minutes or so per stop, a move he said gave him ample time to talk with anyone who stayed after but also offered some respite for his vocal cords.

AD

Biden and his surrogates — he spent the first part of the tour traveling with former U.S. agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie — have argued that Biden is beating Trump head-to-head in battleground states that could decide the election. Iowa Democrats, they said, should consider those numbers when deciding which potential nominee could attract general election voters in key states.

“What about the people who aren’t as involved in politics? What about the independents? Who are they going to trust as well?” Christie Vilsack asked voters in Spencer on Sunday night. “The election is going to be won in the middle. And I want to make sure that I choose the person who’s most electable to the widest group of people.”

AD

Some voters who came to see Biden along the tour acknowledged a concern that a more liberal nominee seemed like a risky bet in the general election.

“I hear a lot of people saying we need to take this . . . swat to the left, and I just don’t agree with that,” said Travis Halm, 29, of Council Bluffs, who came out to see the kickoff to Biden’s bus tour. “We can have a contest about who’s more liberal or who’s more progressive if we want, but it’s not going to do us any good if we’re sitting around sulking on November 4 after losing an election.”

Bob Seggerman, a registered Republican who voted for Trump and plans to do so again in 2020, got talked into coming to an event at a church-turned-restaurant in Spencer by some of his friends who are Democrats.

“I think [Biden has] got a softer appeal that’s more empathetic, and I like him more than the other Democrats,” he said. But, added Seggerman, who at 67 is a decade younger than Biden: “The only thing is, I look at the age of this man. A person who gets to be a certain age is ready to do just about anything but be president.”

On the stump, Biden told voters that Trump’s America had failed middle-class and rural communities like the ones he was visiting on his bus tour. There were also lighter moments, like the widely mocked and memed image of Biden nibbling on his wife’s finger during her opening speech. Mostly, though, he stressed that he would bring a steady hand to the nation’s highest office and foreign policy, and that he’d put middle-class values first.

“I think we have to very deeply restore the backbone of this country, and by that I mean the middle class,” he said.

The tour underscored how Iowa remains vital to Biden’s hopes of winning the nomination. He has vowed to visit all 99 counties during the campaign, though even after the barnstorming trip, he will only have been to about a third. A weak showing in the Feb. 3 caucuses could affect his strength in two other early voting states — South Carolina, where he holds a big lead among that state’s large African American electorate, and Nevada, where he says he has strong Hispanic backing. If he survives there, another threat looms in early March, when the race turns to multiple big states in a Super Tuesday showdown where former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to make his stand.

'Still well in the game'

Biden, in his session with reporters, offered his analysis of the road ahead — all but conceding a potential Iowa defeat but insisting that he alone can rebuild the multiethnic coalition that propelled Obama.

“If I were to come in like some of the polling has shown, you know, like, five points behind, three points behind or seven points behind, I think I survive.” he said. “I think I do well, because of the depth of the support that I have in the African American [and] Latino community, and there’s not anybody so far that has risen to the point where they can all of a sudden everybody in the community can say, ‘Whoa. Wait a minute.’ Well, there is nobody else that’s in there that’s in a position to do what Barack was able to do."

When Kamala Harris announced her presidential campaign in January, Rachel Maddow told her, “I think there is a good chance that you are going to win the nomination.” Soon after, Harris’s 20,000-plus-person kickoff rally in Oakland exceeded expectations set by party chiefs who saw in her an aspirational candidate who could represent the heart of the party both ideologically and demographically. Six months later, when the California senator challenged Joe Biden onstage at the first debate in Miami — surprising everyone, and delivering the most memorable lines of the campaign — her moment seemed to arrive.

But Harris was uneasy even as she vaulted toward the field’s top tier in the ensuing days. She cringed at how the coverage was painting her as the race’s anti-Biden attack artist, not as a nimble realist able to build consensus between the party’s warring factions, as she believed herself to be. She hesitated as some advisors encouraged her to re-embrace the strategy and single out Biden again in the next debate, in Detroit. She delivered no scripted strike, and instead took a pummeling from him and others now eager to take her down a peg. “That wasn’t great,” campaign donors told her at suddenly nervy private fundraising events over the next few days. “That’s an understatement,” she responded.

Harris, however, never reversed and went after Biden. That, she told her inner circle, wasn’t her. Instead, until late this fall — just weeks before she pulled the plug on her campaign on Tuesday afternoon, after reviewing its finances and chances over the Thanksgiving weekend — Harris routinely insisted that she was still introducing herself to Americans. But Harris’s campaign, dogged for months by questions about her health-care stance, her political ideology, and, ultimately, her staff’s infighting, never seemed to settle on a single consistent answer to a question voters kept asking: What was she about? At times on the trail, she presented herself as a matter-of-fact progressive, a comforter-in-chief, and an unapologetic prosecutor. Harris, and those who’ve known her for decades, insist all of these are accurate descriptors, but that at her core she’s a results-oriented pragmatist with a long-running disdain for ideological boxes. That, they often said, is precisely what the country could have used right about now. Yet as Harris tried appealing to as broad a swath of the Democratic electorate as possible, she found that in an overflowing field led by three far better-known characters, being a consensus-style candidate who can offer something to everyone meant it was especially difficult to offer everything to anyone.

When Harris sat down over the weekend to re-evaluate her plans and dig deep into her campaign’s financial state after a pair of brutal reports from the New York Times and Washington Post, she saw an operation quickly running out of cash and low on realistic paths to victory, even though she already qualified for the December debate. She spoke with family and close aides, and considered both her short-term options and her political future beyond the primary race. On Monday, she determined there was no politically acceptable way for her sputtering campaign to keep competing. She opted for an abrupt halt to a fall that would have been unfathomable back in Oakland in January, but which could have worsened in the unforgiving Iowa winter.

It would soon get harder, but at the time, the aftermath of the Detroit debate felt like a new low for Harris’s campaign. Looking back four months later, that stretch crystalized what went wrong. As she struggled to find a meeting of minds with the voters she needed between spring and fall — while Biden held onto his support and Elizabeth Warren gained steam — Harris and her team tried out a series of different messages. They didn’t stop trying until they ultimately settled on “Justice Is on the Ballot” late this year. Some political allies urged her to return to the “fearless” message she’d used while running for Senate in 2016. (“Fearless” was also the name of a TV ad she’d ran that was based around footage of Warren praising her.) Others grumbled that her early focus on “truths” meant little to voters, and that her subsequent “3 A.M. Agenda” wasn’t ambitious enough. “Sometimes her over-preparation comes across as a lack of preparation,” said one of her advisors. Still, most in Harris’s corner were convinced that she was close to hitting the right note. “The political consultant class gnashes their teeth over this — they have to market a product,” a Harris friend and longtime political ally told me this fall. “The problem that they have is: She is what she is. She’s complicated.” After the second debate, her team advised her to start telling more personal stories on the campaign trail, fearing the career prosecutor who was campaigning on her toughness was coming across as too lawyerly.

But then, and throughout the campaign, the advice wasn’t always consistent. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” one former Harris aide who remains close with her team told me repeatedly over the summer and fall. Harris has long been surrounded by a wide array of advisors — in addition to campaign chair Maya Harris (her sister), and campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, there were strategists Sean Clegg, Ace Smith, and Laphonza Butler, former chief of staff Rohini Kosoglu, adman Jim Margolis, and pollster David Binder, among others. “It’s a Kamala thing to have 9,000 people whispering in her ears, thinking they’re running the show,” said another of her ex-aides.

For nearly a year, her allies privately downplayed the importance of Iowa’s caucuses and New Hampshire’s primary to their ultimate strategy, insisting her strength would come in the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina, and then in the big March-voting states, beginning with California. But over the fall and early winter, Harris was forced to effectively shutter her campaign outside of Iowa and, to a lesser extent, South Carolina, in a dramatic but uncertain attempt to free up whatever resources were available for a last-ditch run at those states. (“I’m fucking moving to Iowa,” she was overheard telling Senator Mazie Hirono this fall.) As she slipped into fifth place or worse in national polling, and as she fell far behind in the first-to-caucus state where she bet it all, she cut her payroll and struggled to raise money, all while fighting off a widening stream of stories about disarray among remaining aides. Staff morale plummeted, and private finger-pointing burst into public, with her campaign manager and her sister mired in the middle.

Evidence existed that Harris was connecting with the voters who were still coming to see her and her latest message while she hosted intimate meet-ups and voter dinners — she often ended events hugging and consoling crying Iowans who’d just revealed stories of runaway health-care costs or job loss or gun violence. But her crowds were frequently dwarfed by most of her front-running rivals, as once-Kamala-curious Iowans who’d first seen her lighting up Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, and Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill gravitated elsewhere in the intervening months. And positive November developments — a well-received speech at the same closely-watched pre-caucus fundraising dinner that breathed life into Barack Obama’s campaign in 2007, an endorsement from the influential United Farm Workers union, Thanksgiving in Iowa, and a debate performance widely seen as a much-needed rebound — did little for her polling, which was stuck in mid-single digits, or her fundraising, which flatlined, then bottomed out. Where she was once a widely-liked contender frequently named as voters’ second choice candidate, her net favorability rating dropped by about 25 points in Iowa between June and November, according to in-state polling.

On a gray afternoon late this fall, Harris sat across from me on the second floor of a t-shirt shop in Cedar Rapids, her final stop on a three-day, six-town swing in the eastern part of the state, and explained that she thought voters had a hard time grasping her candidacy because they’d never seen a presidential hopeful quite like her.

Throughout her campaign, Harris, 55, projected a “Can you believe this shit?” air in public when talking about Donald Trump or the day’s latest outrage. But in person, when she was comfortable, she was more analytical. She could be startlingly jocular at times — once, in August, when we were finishing an interview on her campaign bus, rolling up to a Muscatine senior center where she’d lead the residents in a game of bingo, she exuberantly burst out singing, “B-I-N-G-O!” and exhorted her heretofore quiet aides to join in. But she was more often deliberate. Still, as her campaign matured and fumbled, she grew more open to allowing glimpses of how the Trump age and the presidential race hit her personally, which occasionally meant barely masking her frustration.

At the t-shirt shop, she raised her eyebrows and, with a little smile that then turned serious, said she’d been thinking about something, and was going to try it out on me. She was going to say a phrase, and would ask what image I pictured in response. “The boy next door,” she said, then paused. That week, all the buzz on the ground in the state had been about Pete Buttigieg. “There is an image there. And you can think about certain people on the debate stage that could be attributed to.”

“Are there four words who would describe who I am? There’s no frame of reference,” she continued. Exactly a week later she’d announce a mass staff layoff and underscore the extent of her bet on Iowa, to try and catch up to Buttigieg, but also Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren. “Like, we have terms for that guy. He’s the boy next door. That’s your uncle, who’s at the Thanksgiving dinner, who does this thing and that. There are images. The girl next door, there’s an image for that, too.”

“Is there enough time?” one of Harris’s longest-standing political allies asked me as early as September. “I don’t know.” A few weeks later, most of the political world had decided, basically, that there was not. That didn’t stop Harris advisors from pointing out that in late 2003 — the last time a Republican president loathed by the left was up for re-election — John Kerry still trailed Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt in Iowa, which he then won. Perhaps thinking it unwise to compare herself to Kerry, Harris never talked much about that race. But late this fall, after months of pleas from her aides to tell more personal stories, she started speaking about her own time in Iowa 12 years ago, door-knocking for another candidate who was still far behind at that point. Obama’s campaign, too, was described as listless and overmatched before its own Iowa relaunch.

Often, she’d tell the story of meeting an elderly woman at an African-American senior center in Des Moines the night before the 2008 caucuses and convincing her to turn out for Obama even after the woman told her, “They not gonna let him win.” Harris would make the case that her challenge was simply convincing voters she could beat Trump. But by that point, the comeback she’d need just to stay in the game in Iowa — a state where voters and kingmakers pride themselves on their discernment and their patience in making up their minds — was far bigger than both Obama’s and Kerry’s were. In October, I spotted former Iowa Representative Dave Nagle hanging out in the back of a Harris town hall in Waterloo. Nagle, who left Congress 26 years ago and hasn’t endorsed any 2020 candidate, praised Harris’s ambitions in the state, but was far from convinced: He said she had dropped by his office building earlier in the year for a separate meeting, but had neglected to stop by and say hello to him. “As Charlie Brown said, there’s no greater burden than great potential,” he said.

At the time, Harris’s advisors were insisting she could still win if she finished in the top three in Iowa (some privately said top two), and they hoped Trump’s impeachment would return the former prosecutor to voters’ minds. Harris herself, though, hesitated to call the inquiry good for her campaign when Nancy Pelosi first announced it. When I asked her the next day, by phone, whether her history in law enforcement might give her an opening during months of impeachment talk, she replied, “Well, I mean, I suppose there is that.” Soon, though, she became convinced she could make up ground by focusing on Trump: She took to calling him a “walking indictment in a red tie.” Later in the fall, she told me: “He literally told us who he is when he said, ‘I could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue.’ He was saying, ‘I can commit a crime,’ meaning, ‘I’m willing to think that I might, and if I do, I would get away with it.”

Still, “I understand!,” she said of voters’ hesitation while addressing a local party fundraiser in a dark DoubleTree hotel ballroom in Cedar Rapids in October. “People are saying, ‘Maybe it’s not your turn, maybe it’s not your time,’” she continued, over the clink of silverware. “But I will tell you, Linn County, I’ve heard this conversation in every campaign I have — and now here’s the operative word — won.” She was trying to convince Iowans she was still worth considering as her campaign — running perilously low on cash — scrambled to raise enough money to put a new ad on air, or even online. She repeated the line until the campaign’s final days.

The first time I heard a journalist straight-up ask Harris if she would run for president was less than two months after she joined the Senate in 2017. The first time one of her then-likely opponents described to me why she’d be a serious contender was that summer. The first time I heard someone in her orbit outline her possible path to the nomination was before the midterms. This autumn, when it was becoming clear that Harris was struggling to break through to the surprisingly solid top rank of candidates, I started hearing from a quiet cadre in her orbit that believed if she could find a way to last long enough in the race — deep into next year — she might be well positioned to compete in a contested convention next July. That view gained purchase among some of her most loyal supporters, who saw a drawn-out fight as a very long-shot best-case scenario.

But others, including many in her inner circle, wondered how much longer Harris would be willing to stay in a race where she was stuck responding to others and unable to gain attention on her own terms. One of their concerns: That Harris’s name would remain on the California ballot even if she was no longer a viable candidate by the state’s March primary, which could lead to an embarrassing result that further weakened her political standing at home. Even after what Harris’s team thought was a standout performance at November’s debate, it was Buttigieg who gained the most potential new supporters in its immediate aftermath, according to FiveThirtyEight’s overnight polling. Among some aides and allies, whispers about Harris’s future were common — whether she might have a future in someone else’s presidential cabinet; whether she might have to worry about a primary challenge to her Senate seat in 2022; or if there might be room for her to run for the presidency again in 2024 (if Trump is re-elected) or 2028. “I do think she has another shot at this,” said Randi Weingarten, the influential president of the American Federation of Teachers union, in late October.

Harris herself never talked this way, of course — until the final days, she’d pepper her speeches with “I intend to win!” — but she thought, and spoke, more about representation, and what her candidacy meant, in recent weeks. “The feeling that I have, the sense of responsibility to be on that stage, and to do well on that stage because of that responsibility — I never want to disappoint anybody,” she told me in Cedar Rapids, reflecting on her status as the most prominent black woman candidate ever, and just the second since Shirley Chisholm nearly half a century earlier, and a child of immigrants. This was a conversation she’d had with her family when she first decided to run, she said. “Because I know what being on that stage means to a lot of people, and for a lot of people. And I carry that, as something that is heavy. Meaning it is very important.”

Harris’s struggle to get the right voters to truly understand her pitch began the day after her Oakland launch. Rarely has a campaign gone from such a high to damage control so immediately. Speaking with Jake Tapper in Des Moines for a televised town hall, Harris answered a question about private health-care coverage by unspooling a long answer about insurance company bureaucracy that included the line, “Let’s eliminate all of that, let’s move on.” Harris had been the first senator to sign onto Sanders’s famous Medicare for All bill a year-and-a-half earlier, but she’d also co-sponsored a more modest scheme that would permit private insurance in some cases, so it wasn’t yet clear how she’d position herself in the race. The next day, a Harris advisor told CNN she would be open to moderate proposals allowing for some private insurance coverage, and thus began a mind-numbing saga that turned into a media proxy for Harris’s ideological flexibility and unwillingness to be pinned down on policy. In April, she told Pod Save America: “I’m not saying we need to get rid of private insurance.”

By May, she was trying to get off the health-care topic as she leaned into her prosecutorial experience on the trail as a way of contrasting directly with Trump, a pivot that inflamed internal campaign tensions — and questions about decision flow — that were never resolved. On one side was Harris’s sister Maya, her campaign chair who is especially attuned to the activist left. On the other was a set of Harris’s strategists including Clegg and Smith, who saw more opportunity in a more moderate tack. Then, in June, she raised her hand on the debate stage when asked if candidates would “abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan,” only to, afterward, say she thought the question was if she’d give up her own coverage. Finally, in July, Harris released her own plan, with a longer transition period away from private insurance than Sanders’s, but a narrative was already set about her caution and perceived flip-flops. It was en vogue then to compare her to Marco Rubio — a GOP Establishment favorite “candidate of the future,” until he wasn’t, in 2016 — or, as Nate Silver did, to Mitt Romney: “Hits all her marks, positioned quite optimally toward the middle of the primary electorate and has the potential to unite different wings — but voters aren’t entirely clear what she stands for,” he tweeted late that month.

For left-wing activists already suspicious of Harris because of her prosecutorial record, it was all further evidence that she was no true progressive. For wary moderates and conservatives, it was reason enough to think she stood for radical change. All the while, Biden’s support was holding firm and Warren’s was only growing, contrary to the long-standing projections of Harris’s inner circle. Behind the scenes, aides agreed Harris needed a serious fix, and soon, but the lack of a clear chain of command bogged down their decision-making, and territorial tensions ruled out collaboration between some of the team’s most important players.

Yet Warren’s rise through the summer was also forcing Harris into a conversation she found counterproductive, especially during her first extended tour of Iowa, in August. “No false choices” had been something of a personal slogan of hers earlier in her career, and she now saw no contradiction in saying one day that she was not trying to restructure society and another standing for the Green New Deal and eliminating the Senate filibuster to achieve it. Harris refused to pinpoint herself on the Biden-to-Sanders political spectrum, even when asked point-blank. “I think it’s just a nice subject for a graduate class, but it’s not how people are living life,” she told Bloomberg. Later that day, while meeting with farmers in Lacona, Iowa, she said, unprompted, “You don’t have the luxury of engaging in some intellectual political conversation about what we need to grow and thrive.”

“It is frustrating,” she said to me the next day on her shiny black campaign bus (with “KAMALA” written on its side in yellow, blue, and red). “And it’s frustrating because — I mean, this sounds so cliche — but it’s the labels, right? And it tends to oversimplify issues, and it tends to reward or induce a requirement to have really discrete — and not many — categories. And so, ‘Which of these few categories do you fit in?’ Those categories that have been pre-designated, by the way, by other people. And I just refuse to do that.” She leaned forward with her arms crossed, sitting across from a map of the state stuck up on the wall with pins marking her stops in the state. A handful of aides sat around, listening quietly and nodding knowingly. Some pretended not to be listening in. They’d all heard this from her before, and would again. This question “never comes up with voters,” she said. “It never comes up with voters Never! Voters don’t have time for that.”

Harris then decided to play strategist. Upon leaving the state, she called each member of her senior staff. The political territory in Iowa felt more fertile than expected, she told them, and, recalling her time campaigning for Obama in 2007, she said she saw an opportunity to compete seriously there if she could spend enough time on the ground to prove she could win. She directed Rodriguez to draw up an entirely new plan: To make sure she’d now have enough resources to compete in Iowa and increase her in-state staffing, and to fill the fall with stops in the state. In September, she announced her first surprise pivot to Iowa. Soon after, she redrew her campaign’s organization to give Kosoglu a formal role and hand Butler direct reports, aiming to establish order.

That discipline never arrived, and she also spent nearly all of late August and September off the trail, raising money — which was supposed to come easier to her given her history running high-dollar campaigns in California, but which was both an increasingly difficult task amid Buttigieg’s rise and her plateauing polls, and doubly important to fund her Iowa push. For over a month, she didn’t visit Iowa. When she started returning, her crowds were smaller, the focus elsewhere. With the media’s eyes on other candidates, Harris resumed talking about health-care — promoting her proposal’s protection of union workers’ plans, and calling it “Medicare for All.”

A few weeks later, she tried putting a more positive spin on the lingering questions about her political identity. Harris was in Los Angeles, taking a quick break from a West Coast fundraising swing, and when I asked about her struggles explaining her health-care position to a national audience, she grew reflective. “It can often just be the inability to see something they’ve never seen before, so they want to put it in a box that they have seen before. So it’s maybe an oversimplification. That’s the challenge, really,” she said, sounding far less exasperated than on the bus, slightly more at peace with this existential challenge. She was “asking people to see something they’ve never seen before. And I know it is asking a lot, and I say, based on experience: I know people are up for it.”

In September, a Los Angeles Times survey revealed that Democratic voters identified Harris as their closest ideological fit, after all. A week later, a poll conducted by Binder, working for another client, showed her slipping into sixth place in Iowa, down 13 points from mid-summer.

Since the day Harris launched her campaign in January, some Democrats in her orbit wondered aloud whether it’d be worth starting a super PAC to support her. The notion was always knocked down as other candidates rejected help from such outside groups, but the idea never quite died.

Late Tuesday morning, operatives monitoring TV ad spending noticed that a brand-new super PAC had started placing buys to run a pro-Harris spot in Iowa. It was a last-ditch, million dollar effort created by long-time aides to prop her up as her own campaign effectively ran out of cash as she criss-crossed the state. The cavalry wasn’t quite arriving to save her, but here, at least, was a much-needed last-second boost. The plan was to air a minute-long video that featured Harris grilling Barr, Kavanaugh, and Sessions, and closed by calling her “the Democrat for president that Donald Trump fears most.”

Early Tuesday afternoon, Harris got on a conference call with what remained of her campaign staff. She thanked them for their work, but told them this was the end of the road.

“I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,” she wrote in a final email to supporters. “I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do.”

Within an hour, the super PAC canceled its ad buy.

But while most of those who’ve dropped out over the course of the year were white men (including two already this week), Harris was both the best-polling nonwhite candidate and, for a brief moment this summer, someone who looked as if she might ascend to the top tier of the crowded field. That surge, following the first debate, soon faded, and Harris never regained her momentum.

There have been 27 major or major-adjacent candidates who’ve declared at some point. Fifteen of them remain, including the recent additions of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.

The debate criteria introduced by the Democratic Party have been effective at winnowing the field. While many of those still in the race haven’t been making the cut for recent debates, many of those who dropped out did so after failing to earn a debate slot.

But compare where we are now with what the field looked like on Valentine’s Day. At that point, most of those who had declared were women, black or Hispanic. Most of them are still in the race, even with Harris’s departure.

Now compare that with what the field looks like after Harris left.

Pay particular attention to that December debate column. It shows the six candidates who’ve earned a slot, all of whom are white. Harris had earned a slot but obviously won’t be participating following her departure from the race.

AD

AD

Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. Its strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.

It’s important to recognize, though, that this assessment of the collapse of diversity in the field overlooks two important factors.

The first is that we’re really only talking about racial and ethnic diversity. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will appear in December, as will candidates who would become the first Jewish (Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) or openly gay (South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg) presidents in U.S. history.

AD

AD

The second is that one reason that the field is narrowing to mostly white candidates is Democratic voters overwhelmingly support white candidates. The Post’s most recent primary poll, conducted with ABC News, showed that white candidates earned more than 80 percent of all support from Democratic primary voters, driven by the two-thirds eaten up by former vice president Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders. White men got just under 60 percent of all support.

Among nonwhite voters, white men got more support than among Democratic voters overall, albeit so slightly that the difference isn’t statistically significant. Even that is noteworthy, though: White and nonwhite voters support white and nonwhite candidates about equally.

At least when considered in demographic groups. Biden fares much better with black primary voters than do other candidates, one central reason he continues to lead the field.

AD

AD

As CNN’s Ronald Brownstein has noted, no candidate has been able to cobble together a coalition like the one enjoyed by Barack Obama in 2008. Biden’s doing well with black voters, Warren and Buttigieg are jostling for college-educated whites, and Sanders is performing well with younger voters. A broad split — but, again, all white.

As is often the case in American politics in 2019, President Trump plays a role here. Defeating Trump continues to be a primary motivation for Democratic primary voters, and white Democratic candidates continue to be seen — however justifiably — as the candidates with the best chance of winning in 2020. In our November poll, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the candidates most capable of beating Trump.

Perceptions of electability can change quickly. It did for Harris after her first debate performance, and it has for other candidates in the past. So far this year, though, Biden’s edge on electability has been consistent, even as electability has become a central concern of voters. That has been an ongoing problem for his opponents.

The other problem, of course, is that you have to be a candidate to benefit from a sudden surge in views of your electability. With a field winnowing down to largely white candidates, the odds that the Democratic nominee isn’t white necessarily drop significantly.

Sundar Pichai has been acting like Alphabet’s top leader in Washington for more than a year. Now, it’s official.

Alphabet CEO Larry Page and President Sergey Brin made a surprise announcement yesterday that they are stepping away from day-to-day operations at the company they co-founded, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports. They’re handing the reins over to Pichai, thrusting the Google CEO into the top role at Alphabet at perhaps the most critical juncture in its 21-year-history. The company is confronting broad political backlash over potentially anti-competitive behavior, its data collection practices and even election security, among other controversies.

But Pichai’s new job title will probably have little immediate effect on the company’s political battles. He’s already been on the front lines and weathering the techlash in Washington in the absence of Page, who he reported to until yesterday.

Page was largely missing in action in Washington for more than a year. Senators tore him apart last September when he was a no-show at an Intelligence Committee hearing with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey.

Pichai — who also declined to testify at that hearing — was left to clean up the mess solo. He held quiet meetings with members of Congress, the White House and Pentagon officials to smooth things over. He was the executive the company later sent to Washington for a Capitol Hill grilling. President Trump even targeted Pichai personally in tweets over the summer as he attacked Google, without evidence, for being biased against conservatives.

Pichai has also been leading the company's annual developer conference and quarterly investor call, Greg notes.

The new Alphabet CEO has “effectively been the spokesperson for Google and for Alphabet for a while now,” Alan Davidson, who opened Google's Washington office in 2005 and now serves as Mozilla vice president of global policy, trust and security, told me in an interview.

Pichai’s treatment in Washington hasn’t been all that different from other embattled tech titans, like Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey. The only distinction was that unlike those executives, Pichai didn’t have the top role in the company’s organization chart.

But he was overseeing the products regulators are most worried about, including YouTube as well as the company’s search and advertising businesses. Alphabet, the Google parent company established in 2015, encompasses a much wider range of businesses, including the self-driving car division Waymo, the smart-home appliance maker Nest and other “moonshot initiatives.” But regulators have largely not paid attention to the company's organizational structure.

“Regulators have seen Google and Alphabet as largely synonymous,” Davidson said. “This move is not going to change any of that.”

Page will not have an operational role at the company for the first time since Google's founding, though he and Brin will retain their board seats and company shares. The announcement marks the end of an era, especially because the two co-founders played an integral role in shaping the values that have defined the company politically, Davidson said.

“They played pivotal role in deciding what Google stood for,"" he said.

They also shaped the company's unique corporate culture — which was widely celebrated until recent years, as divisions between employees and management broke out over issues ranging from the company's work with the Pentagon to its handling of sexual harassment claims.

BITS: Genius Media Group is suing Google for lifting lyrics from its site and engaging in what it claims amounts to anti-competitive practices, the Wall Street Journal's Robert McMillan reports. The lawsuit puts a spotlight on how the search giant can stymie smaller rivals as regulators open antitrust probes into Google and other tech titans.

The lawsuit seeks $50 million in combined minimum damages from Google and LyricFind, the company that provides lyrics for Google's information panels on its search page. Genius alleges that its search traffic plummeted after Google began publishing lyrics on its search results page and that Google and LyricFind violated the website's terms of service. The company found more than 1,000 instances of its watermarked lyrics appearing on Google's website since August. In one instance, when Google posted lyrics directly to its search page, site traffic to Genius's lyrics page plummeted 70 percent.

Yelp and Trip Advisor have also publicly accused Google of favoring its own content in search results to stifle competition.

NIBBLES: Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been one of the loudest advocates for breaking up Big Techl. Now the Massachusetts Democrat is drafting legislation to strengthen antitrust law, bringing her battle with Silicon Valley to the Senate, The Information's Ashley Gold reports.

The legislation would give the regulators more authority to punish violations of antitrust laws, Ashley reports. A draft tentatively titled the""Anti-Monopoly and Competition Restoration Act"" is circulating in Washington.

“Introducing a bill on antitrust would allow Warren to claim she is doing something while on the campaign trail about what she says is an excessive concentration of power among companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet,"" Gold writes.

Warren's campaign previously released a plan outlining how she proposes to break up the tech giants, such as breaking off WhatsApp from Facebook. Her plan would also prevent companies like Amazon and Apple from peddling their own products or apps on the platforms they manage.

There's bipartisan support of greater antitrust scrutiny, especially as state attorneys general from both political parties open a flurry of antitrust investigations into tech giants. But any major overhaul of antitrust law is unlikely to pass as Congress is focused on an election year and the impeachment inquiry.

BYTES: YouTube reports that U.S. viewers spent 70 percent less time watching videos that advance conspiracies and other debunked theories following changes it made earlier this year, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports.

The Google-owned company didn't release additional figures, such as how much time viewers still spend on the videos or how often they're clicked.

YouTube now pushes users toward news sources and creators it deems “high-authority"" when searching for news events, the company says. For instance, in searches for news events such as “Brexit,” 93 percent of the top 10 recommended videos are from creators YouTube deems “high-authority.” The company didn't disclose its sample size for that data, however. And many viewers of conspiracy content subscribe directly to the channels that promote it, Greg reports.

“There will always be content on YouTube that brushes up against our policies, but doesn’t quite cross the line,” YouTube said in the blog post. “We’ve been working to raise authoritative voices on YouTube and reduce the spread of borderline content and harmful misinformation.”

The company's efforts to reduce viewership of unreliable information follows significant criticism of its moderation policies. In January it adjusted its algorithms to reduce recommendations of unreliable content.

-- Four recently fired Google employees announced their intent to file charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging they were fired in retaliation for organizing workers at the tech giant, Ryan Mac at BuzzFeed News reports. The complaint could spark a wide investigation into the search giant's labor practices as it attempts to crack down on internal unrest.

“We participated in legally protected labor organizing, fighting to improve workplace conditions for all Google workers,” Laurence Berland, Rebecca Rivers, Paul Duke and Sophie Waldman, the four fired employees, wrote in a letter posted on Medium. “Google didn’t respond by honoring its values, or abiding by the law. It responded like a large corporation more interested in revenue growth than in ensuring worker rights and ethical conduct.”

“We dismissed four individuals who were engaged in intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data security policies, including systematically accessing and disseminating other employees’ materials and work,” a Google representative told BuzzFeed. “No one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company’s activities.”

An internal memo said that the employees were fired for searching, accessing and distributing information including the calendars of other employees outside the company, Bloomberg News reported last week.

THE BIG IDEA: Research experiments conducted by social scientists help illustrate why it’s so insidious for President Trump and his congressional defenders to keep parroting the debunked conspiracy theory, which originated with Russian intelligence agencies, that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

People who are repeatedly exposed to the same false information, even if they’re initially told that it is false, feel fewer qualms sharing it on social media after each additional time they see it. In five experiments involving more than 2,500 Americans, Daniel Effron, who teaches organizational behavior at the London Business School, and Medha Raj, a PhD student at the University of Southern California, documented how seeing a fake headline just once leads individuals to temper their disapproval of the misinformation when they see it a second, third or fourth time. They outline their findings in the new edition of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

The researchers asked online survey participants to rate how unethical or acceptable they thought it would be to publish a fake headline, and how likely they would be to like, share, block or unfollow the person who posted it. Participants were much more prone to “like” or share headlines they’d seen previously and less likely to block or unfollow the person who posted them, even if they were warned the information was false. The results shows a tendency of humans to misremember false headlines as true because they’ve seen them before. The researchers argue that repeating misinformation in the echo chamber of something like social media lends it a “ring of truthfulness” that can increase people’s tendency to give it a moral pass, regardless of whether they believe it.

“Misinformation can stoke political polarization and undermine democracy, so it is important for people to understand when and why it spreads,” said Effron.

-- Thus far, the truth is that the president’s broader efforts to muddy the waters surrounding the Ukraine affair have been remarkably effective. About four dozen national and state polls have now been conducted since the impeachment inquiry was announced. Public attitudes have stayed remarkably consistent, and they didn’t shift in a statistically significant way after the televised congressional hearings. Our in-house pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin review the data:

“Democrats and Republicans are mirror opposites on the issue, with an average of 86 percent of Democrats supporting impeachment, compared with 9 percent of Republicans. Democrats have grown more united in their support for impeachment since before the inquiry began, when polls showed roughly two-thirds supported impeachment. Among Republicans, an average of 87 percent are opposed, while 8 percent of Democrats say the same. …

“The stability of Trump’s approval ratings affirms just how locked-in Americans are in their views toward Trump, even as some independents and Democrats changed their opinion on whether Congress should impeach and remove him from office. The lack of movement in this essential measure of Trump’s political standing also indicates that while most Americans think Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, news and congressional testimony about this issue have not shifted how people feel about the president.”

-- Anecdotal evidence also bears this out. An Associated Press reporter interviewed voters around Wisconsin last week and found that many either aren’t paying attention or don’t know how to decipher the back-and-forth over the president’s conduct. To wit: “Everything they say, it’s so repetitive. To me, it’s like they’re beating their heads against the wall,” said Harry Rose, a 78-year-old retired factory worker and Trump supporter in Racine County. Nicole Morrison, a 36-year-old nurse who can’t see herself voting for Trump in 2020, had a similar review. “There’s so much information that sometimes it’s hard to decide which is the truth and which is just rumors,” she said. “So I just don’t pay attention to it.”

-- In a preface to the House Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday afternoon, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) noted that the core facts aren’t in dispute and warned about the “corrosive” dangers of tribalism. “If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism,” Schiff wrote. “Although the Framers viewed parties as necessary, they also endeavored to structure the new government in such a way as to minimize the ‘violence of faction.’ As George Washington warned in his farewell address, ‘the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.’”

The Constitution is mentioned more than 100 times in the 300-page report, which alleges that Trump “compromised national security to advance his personal political interests” and engaged in an “unprecedented campaign” to obstruct congressional efforts to uncover his abuses of power. “Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party,” Schiff concluded. “But perhaps even more corrosive to our democratic system of governance, the President and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences?”

-- A procession of events over the past 24 hours underscored the pervasiveness of factionalism. The Intelligence Committee approved Schiff’s report on a party-line, 13-to-9 vote. Republicans on the committee released their own 123-page prebuttal the day before that said Trump’s approach to Ukraine was founded on “genuine and reasonable” suspicions about the country.

-- Attending the NATO summit in London, meanwhile, Trump accused Democrats of being “unpatriotic” by moving ahead with impeachment while he’s traveling overseas. Trump then suggested that Schiff might be “in a jail” if he wasn’t in Congress for what he’s said about the president. “I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being,” Trump said. “I think he’s a very sick man.” Trump boasted that Democrats trying to impeach him is getting rank-and-file Republicans to rally around him. “I don’t think we’ve ever had the spirit right now that we have in the Republican Party, and the impeachment hoax is what’s done it,” he said, adding that the GOP is will stick together “like glue” because of the investigations.

Democrats punched back, such as New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. But this only underscored the partisan divisions:

Unpatriotic?



You are not a King.



You are not the Chosen One.



You are not the Supreme Leader.



You are an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to our democracy who will be held accountable for your brazen #AbuseOfPower.

A video that went viral overnight shows three foreign leaders apparently laughing about Trump’s antics behind his back during a reception at Buckingham Palace. Unaware that they were on camera, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seemed to ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron if they were late for their audience with Queen Elizabeth II because of Trump’s impromptu press conference. “You just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Trudeau answers.

This morning, Trump called Trudeau “two-faced” for his comments on the hot mic. Sitting beside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he added that the Canadian was just lashing out because he called him out for not spending enough money on defense.

-- Perhaps the most revealing illustration of the tribalism, though, came last night when 71 House Republicans voted against a bipartisan resolution saying that Russia should not be allowed to attend future Group of Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, gives Crimea back to Ukraine and adheres to the standards of democratic societies. The measure passed with 339 votes, including unanimous Democratic support and 116 Republicans.

Republican lawmakers loudly and overwhelmingly cheered Mitt Romney when, as the party’s nominee for president in 2012, he declared that Russia was the biggest geostrategic threat facing the United States. Now, with a very different standard-bearer in Trump, many of those same lawmakers try to look the other way as a revanchist Russia viciously asserts itself against free societies and deepens strategic ties with communist China. In this case, 71 did. (The list of Republicans who voted with Russia is here.)

Trump wants to welcome an emboldened Vladimir Putin back into the fold. At the G-7 summit in France this summer, Trump strongly advocated on Russia’s behalf over multiple days. He even announced plans to invite Putin to the G-7 summit in the United States. Rank-and-file Republicans take cues from right-wing elites, including Trump and Tucker Carlson, who has used his prime-time platform on Fox News to make some startling, eyebrow-raising comments about Russia in recent days. “I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine,” Carlson said last week.

-- A Post contributing columnist who formerly served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia and has held a senior post on the National Security Council under Barack Obama, chastised Carlson:

I speak Russian. I know Russia. I've lived there for 8 years of my life. You are wrong Mr. Carlson. Putin does hate America. You (I assume unwittingly) help his anti-American objectives with these ill-informed rants. Be a patriot. Stop attacking Americans & defending Putin. https://t.co/izg1TwNJwH — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) December 3, 2019

-- “The inchoate and unproved nature of the Republican case against Ukraine has not prevented several GOP leaders from taking up the cause,” Bob Costa and Karoun Demirjian report. “There is also a growing view inside the GOP that the party’s core voters will not revolt if the party takes a softer position on Russia — a calculation backed by polling during Trump’s presidency. Gallup’s surveys, for instance, show that an expanding group of Republicans — 40 percent in July 2018 — now says Russia is a U.S. ally or is friendly, up from 22 percent in 2014, while 25 percent of Democrats say the same, little changed from 2014.”

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” said Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

-- As other Republicans have capitulated to Trump on Russia, Romney is holding firm. “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” the senator from Utah told reporters on Tuesday. “Leaders of the countries are pulling for one candidate or another, that’s to be expected, but there’s a big difference between pulling for someone, hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering in the way Russia did.”

-- Many Democratic lawmakers are forcefully rejecting the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered, but this also has the unintended consequence of drawing more attention to the underlying false claim. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he’s sat through more than 25 hearings and briefings about what happened in 2016. “In none of those meetings was there ever a hint, a breath, a suggestion, a word that somehow Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election in the interference or the influence campaign. It was Russia. And it was Russia in a systematic, widespread way,” King said on CNN.

Ukrainians, including government officials, spoke out against Trump publicly in 2016 after he said that maybe Crimea should remain part of Russia. “That would be like us being angry that somebody else took Florida,” King noted. “I mean, it was understandable, but that's been blown up into somehow that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 interference campaign. It wasn't.”

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), asked David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, a hearing yesterday if there was any reason to doubt Fiona Hill’s testimony last month that the conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s interference in 2016 “is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services themselves.” Hale said he did. “Is our national security made stronger or weaker when members of the administration or members of Congress insist on repeating debunked Russian lies?” Menendez asked. “That does not serve our interest,” Hale replied.

-- This whole donnybrook is just the latest illustration of the president refusing to believe his own intelligence briefings. Speaking publicly for the first time since being pushed out of government after 30 years of service, former deputy director of national intelligence Sue Gordon told the Women’s Foreign Policy Group on Tuesday that one of Trump's most common responses to intelligence briefings is to doubt what he's being told. She said “I don’t think that’s true” was the president’s most frequent reply. Trump broke with protocol by blocking Gordon from becoming acting director of national intelligence when Dan Coats stepped down this summer.

“Gordon seemed to suggest that it was more difficult trying to figure out where the President had gotten the information that was shaping his beliefs and opinions than dealing with his tendency to doubt what he was being told,” CNN reports. “Gordon's ouster came about because Trump, who has had a contentious relationship with his own intelligence services, wanted a political loyalist in the role who would ‘rein in’ the intelligence agencies. … Gordon suggested that the President's intelligence briefers not only faced a challenge because of Trump's lack of familiarity with the world of intelligence, but also because he consumes information and hears opinions that aren't as carefully vetted as an intelligence product.”

-- Believe it or not, the rank partisanship will grow even starker as the impeachment process shifts today from the Intelligence Committee to the House Judiciary Committee. Trump’s defenders are intent on making the process look as partisan and circus-like as possible, and they now have a good venue to do so. Some of Capitol Hill’s most aggressive and colorful characters are members, from Matt Gaetz and Louie Gohmert on the Republican side to Steve Cohen and Sheila Jackson Lee on the Democratic side.

Nancy Pelosi gets to handpick the members of the Intelligence Committee. Schiff keeps his members on a much tighter leash. In contrast, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is much more free-wheeling. That’s partly how that Corey Lewandowski hearing got so out of hand in September. Nadler says he’s ready for the spotlight this time. (Elise Viebeck, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore the power dynamics within the committee more deeply.) “It’s a bunch of brawlers sometimes on the Judiciary Committee, so it should get pretty hot under the collar as we go along,” said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the panel, during an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Phone-call records disclosed in the Intelligence Committee’s new report show extensive contact between Rudy Giuliani and the White House during key moments of the Ukraine saga. Paul Sonne, Rosalind S. Helderman and Greg Miller report: “The call records provide powerful circumstantial evidence that Giuliani was coordinating with the White House on his Ukraine gambit, something Giuliani has previously acknowledged. The records also show contact between a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, and one of Trump’s key defenders in Congress, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.). … [Schiff] said ‘the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.’ …

“Giuliani’s phone records include calls with a number designated only as ‘-1,’ sometimes close in time to calls between Giuliani and the White House switchboard. The suggestion is that ‘-1’ might be a phone belonging to Trump, though the report does not state that clearly. Schiff, speaking to the Los Angeles Times, said he suspects the number could be Trump’s and that the committee is trying to find out whether calls logged as ‘-1’ indeed came from the president. …

“The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and [Volodymyr Zelensky] that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and ‘-1’ on Aug. 8. … The call records also show a number of phone calls between Nunes and Giuliani and between Nunes and Parnas earlier this year. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, has accused Nunes and his staff of participating in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.”

-- The report details 58 calls Giuliani made over the course of six days. (Philip Bump breaks them down here.)

-- Nunes, speaking last night to Sean Hannity on Fox News, said it’s “possible” that he spoke with Parnas, although he doesn’t recall doing so. “I remember that name now, because he’s been indicted,” said the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people. … We have Americans and foreigners contact us every single day with information.” He also dismissed questions about his contacts with Giuliani. “We were actually laughing about how [Bob] Mueller bombed out,” Nunes said of his conversations with Giuliani. (Felicia Sonmez)

QUOTE OF THE DAY: ""They weren’t talking about where to find sushi in Kyiv,"" Parnas's lawyer said of the phone conversations between his client and Nunes. He's trying to get immunity in exchange for the testimony of his client, who has been indicted on a host of charges. ( Wall Street Journal )

THE LEGAL BATTLES:

-- Trump’s personal attorneys remain on the sidelines as the president battles the inquiry. Carol D. Leonnig reports: “The president is relying almost exclusively on White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his in-house team of attorneys … The White House lawyers are not sharing with his personal attorneys some internal government records central to the inquiry about the pressure the administration put on Ukraine, citing the need to protect executive privilege. The unusual decision to have the White House counsel captain the president’s defense — at least for now — departs from how previous presidents have contended with impeachment proceedings and has worried some Trump allies, who believe a multipronged defense would be stronger. … Cipollone has taken the lead, operating separately from Jay Sekulow, a conservative Christian legal advocate who is the leader of the president’s personal legal team, joined by seasoned white-collar defense lawyers Jane and Marty Raskin.”

-- A federal judge is weighing whether to order the State Department to release internal communications between Pompeo and two of the three men designated by Trump to steer Ukraine policy. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Christopher R. ‘Casey’ Cooper of Washington on Tuesday heard arguments in a public-records lawsuit seeking communications by Kurt Volker, former State Department envoy to Ukraine, and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, with other State Department officials including Pompeo. … The Trump administration has declined to release records to the House, as part of the White House’s blanket refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. However, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) empowers judges to order the release of documents requested by members of the public, and federal lawsuits to enforce such requests can move much more quickly through the courts than battles over congressional subpoenas.”

-- A federal appeals court ruled that House Democrats can access Trump’s private financial records from two banks, citing a “public interest” by refusing to block congressional subpoenas. Ann E. Marimow and Renae Merle report: “The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information. The court gave the president seven days to seek review by the Supreme Court in the case … Sekulow said in a statement Tuesday that Trump’s legal team believes the subpoenas are ‘invalid as issued’ and is reviewing the ruling to determine next steps, ‘including seeking review at the Supreme Court.’”

-- A key witness in Mueller’s investigation has been indicted with seven others on charges of conspiring to funnel more than $3 million in illegal campaign contributions. Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: “George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates who acted as an intermediary for members of [Trump’s] presidential campaign seeking to forge contacts in the Middle East, was charged with conspiring to make conduit campaign contributions and related offenses in a 53-count indictment unsealed Tuesday in Washington, prosecutors said. U.S. prosecutors also charged Ahmad ‘Andy’ Khawaja, a Lebanese American businessman, with 35 counts related to allegations that he conspired with Nader to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in campaign contributions directed to U.S. political committees associated with presidential candidates.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race. Chelsea Janes reports: The California senator, “proud of being one of the only presidential candidates to spend Thanksgiving in Iowa and not at home, invited reporters into her temporary residence in Des Moines on the holiday to show off her turkey preparation skills. What she didn’t say at the time was that she was also having intensive conversations with her husband, her sister Maya Harris and Maya’s family as the tightknit group grappled with whether there was any path forward for her campaign. The talks extended into late Monday night, as Kamala Harris stayed up until 2 a.m. futilely trying to find a way to push on. But Tuesday around 12:45, she called her staffers to tell them it was all over. … [The end] marked a long, painful fall from her January kickoff, when Harris ran onstage to electrify a crowd of more than 22,000, the embodiment of Democratic hopes that she represented one of their best chances to beat Trump — a rising female star with a mixed-race background who could rebuild the coalition that propelled Barack Obama. …

“In a note to supporters Tuesday, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. ‘I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,’ she wrote. ... Some Democratic activists saw Harris’s departure as a troubling sign that minority candidates are not faring well despite the party’s ostensible sensitivity to diversity. … The news came as a particular shock to backers who that very morning had announced a super PAC to support Harris’s candidacy. Some donors spent the day frantically trying to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars they had wired into the super PAC’s account. …

""Harris remains a potentially appealing running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee. Unlike the senators staying in the race, she will be free to spend January focused on Trump’s expected Senate impeachment trial … An aide said an assessment of the campaign’s finances conducted over the weekend found that after raising about $12 million in each of the year’s first three quarters, the operation was failing to keep up that pace, raising just ‘a fraction’ of that amount this quarter. That left Harris without money to spend on ads in Iowa and elsewhere, essentially forcing her hand.”

-- Harris’s exit indicates that a once historically diverse Democratic field may winnow down to only whites. Philip Bump reports: “The six candidates who’ve earned a slot [in the next Democratic debate] are white. … Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. [The DNC's] strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.”

-- Castro said Harris’s campaign suffered because the media holds candidates of color to different standards. From BuzzFeed News: “‘I don’t know if it impacted her decision to withdraw from the race or not, but I’m sure it didn’t help,’ Castro, the only Latino candidate running for president, [said] on Tuesday night. ‘This was a narrative from very early on. … From the earliest critique that she has no black support, the [Congressional Black Caucus] is going other directions. It’s just holding people to different standards,’ he said.”

-- As he fights to establish himself as the most liberal candidate, Bernie Sanders has split from Elizabeth Warren with his embrace of far-left foreign leaders. From Politico: “Sanders’ foreign policy views are a clear mark of distinction from Warren in a race in which their domestic agendas are viewed as very similar. Left-wing leaders around the world see an ally in Sanders — Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently thanked him for his ‘solidarity’ and Bolivia's ousted Evo Morales called him ‘hermano Bernie Sanders’ — but have not publicly embraced Warren in the same way. … Sanders has made clear during his campaign that he shares many of the left wing's long-held critiques of American imperialism — from opposition to clandestine interference across the world, but particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, to disapproval of the American military's global footprint. … Warren, by contrast, has been more cautious on foreign affairs, straddling the line between the left and the Democratic foreign policy establishment. She has not been as definitive about the situation in Bolivia, where Morales was forced to resign under pressure by the military after allegations of election fraud in what Sanders deemed a ‘coup.’ Nor has she gone out of her way to praise and cultivate relationships with leftist figures around the world.”

-- North Carolina has a new congressional map for 2020. Ted Mellnik and Tim Meko report: “According to the Associated Press, state judges said the new map, drawn last month by Republican legislators, was good enough for immediate use and that there was not time for further study. The map is likely to add two seats for Democrats in 2020, but it probably won’t end controversy over partisan gerrymandering in the state. … Based on 2016 election results, the new map appears to tilt five districts to Democrats and eight to Republicans. The two new congressional seats expected to favor Democrats are in the 6th and 2nd districts. The 6th will pool Democrats previously divided among three Republican districts around Greensboro. The new 2nd has been carved out of a Democratic stronghold in Raleigh. There is little change in the 12th District, where Charlotte Democrats and minorities remain packed. The Democratic seats under the new map are not locks for the party. The 1st, 2nd and 4th districts all lean Democratic by less than five points, meaning they could have competitive races in 2020.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump unsettled the world stage on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London. Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: “Trump openly jousted with French President Emmanuel Macron — a leader who until recently had been one of Trump’s earliest and most prominent partners in bromance. He thrust Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uncomfortably into the spotlight, dubbing Trudeau’s country ‘slightly delinquent’ and asking for Canada’s ‘number’ on meeting its financial commitment to NATO’s shared defense. And he previewed a likely confrontation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, also over Germany’s financial contributions to NATO. … To watch Trump perform alongside other world leaders was to witness his use of disequilibrium as political strategy, deployed throughout his presidency to keep everyone slightly off-kilter. Over the course of three one-on-one meetings with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Macron and Trudeau, Trump turned what were expected to be brief photo opportunities into his own personal daytime cable show. As the other leaders largely bore witness, the U.S. president — frequently affable, occasionally bored — held forth for a collective two hours, fielding questions on topics ranging from the impeachment investigation he left at home to the British election campaign he flew into here. …

“At his afternoon appearance with Macron, Trump and the French president articulated their disagreements — at times quite forcefully — but with a veneer of conciliation. … Macron reiterated that he was not backing down from his comments to the Economist. … ‘When we speak about NATO, it’s not just about money. We have to be respectful with our soldiers. The first burden we share, the first cost we pay, is our soldiers’ lives,’ [Macron said]. Trump then turned to Macron and suggested that Europe — and the French president in particular — should shoulder more responsibility for taking back captured Islamic State fighters. ‘Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?’ Trump asked with a smirk. ‘I can give them to you.’ … By nightfall in London, Trump and Macron appeared to have put the day’s acrimony aside. … Several leaders will enter the formal NATO meeting on Wednesday with strategies inside their thick briefing books about what to do if Trump threatens to quit NATO on the spot.”

-- Today is the second day of the NATO summit, and participants are bracing for more contentious meetings. Michael Birnbaum raises the curtain: “Trump was scheduled for a day of highs and lows: after the three-hour discussion with all 28 other NATO leaders, he planned to have lunch with representatives from countries that are meeting spending alliance spending guidelines. It could be a moment to showcase his efforts to boost European defense contributions. But he will also have a one-on-one meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel … At the meeting, leaders are expected to approve a slew of new defense plans in a choreographed move intended to paper over the contentious relations of recent years. They will agree that outer space is a military domain that NATO needs to defend. They will also discuss how the alliance should handle the rise of China as a potential strategic threat. And they will agree on plans for Europe and Canada to spend more money on NATO’s central budget, to save the United States some money — a drop in the bucket in the context of overall defense spending, but still a symbolic gesture to Trump’s demands that other countries pick up some of the slack. Leaders are also expected to clash about a Turkish demand that the alliance give concessions about the Kurdish fighting groups in northeast Syria that have been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Erdogan says the Kurds are dangerous terrorists — and he has blocked unrelated approvals for updated military plans to defend the Baltics from Russia until he gets his way.”

-- The French government threatened massive European Union retaliation if Trump follows through on his threats to slap tariffs on dozens of popular French products. James McAuley reports: “Later in the day, [Trump] suggested that some kind of compromise might be achievable, and [Macron] indicated his willingness to work toward one. This came hours after Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, vowed what he called a ‘strong European riposte’ to Trump’s proposed tariffs.”

-- Trump announced that next year's G-7 summit will be held at Camp David after giving up plans to hold it at his private resort in Doral, Fla. Colby Itkowitz reports: ‘We’re going to do it at Camp David and we’ll be doing some special things at Camp David,’ Trump said. ‘It’s nearby, it’s close. We’re going to give really great access to the press, you’ll have great access. And we’ll have a little bit of a Washington deliverance. But it will be at Camp David, which is a place people like.’ The White House had previously panned suggestions that he host at Camp David in Maryland, as [Obama] had in 2012. ‘I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,’ acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had said in an Oct. 17 news conference. ‘It was way too small. It was way too remote.’”

-- Trump is waging a war of attrition against America’s diplomats. From GQ: “Previously unpublished data from the AFSA shows that the foreign service is losing people at an alarming clip. In the first two years of Trump’s presidency, nearly half of the State Department’s Career Ministers retired or were pushed out. Another 20 percent of its Minister Counselors, one rank level down, also left.”

-- Trump nearly avoided wading into British politics while at NATO. William Booth and Karla Adam report: The president “was relatively diplomatic Tuesday, promising to ‘stay out’ of British politics, just 10 days before a general election. But he couldn’t quite help himself. In the same breath, Trump declared that his ally Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ‘very capable and I think he’ll do a good job” if elected Dec. 12. As for Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, the president on Tuesday said, ‘I can work with anybody.’”

-- Murky allegations of supposed Russian interference in the British election are flying, with less than two weeks to go before voters head to the polls. Adam Taylor reports: “The latest victim is Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party and a challenger to the Conservative government of Boris Johnson, who had last month proudly displayed a series of leaked government documents that portrayed ongoing bilateral trade negotiations in an unflattering role. On Tuesday, the country’s leading center-right newspaper splashed its front page with a headline that argued the dossier ‘points to Russians.’ Citing an investigation by the consulting firm Graphika, the Daily Telegraph wrote that senior members of the Conservative Party were now calling for Corbyn to ‘come clean.’ But wait — hasn’t the Conservative government been asked to come clean, too? Yes, Johnson’s right-wing government has its own, unresolved issues with Russia. At the start of November, it was accused of sitting on a report that investigates possible Russian interference in British politics, delaying the release of the report’s supposedly damning findings until after the Dec. 12 vote.”

-- Global greenhouse gas emissions will hit another record high this year, experts project. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Total carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry totaled 36.8 billion tons, according to an estimate from the Global Carbon Project, an academic consortium that produces the figures annually. That represents a 0.6 percent increase from 2018, which until now stood as the record. … Global emissions have risen for three consecutive years, at a time when they should be starting to drop sharply if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The news of still-growing greenhouse gas emissions is the latest in a drumbeat of negative findings that come as world leaders gather in Madrid for an annual climate change conference, where they face mounting pressure to alter the current trajectory.”

​​​​​​-- North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is -- quite literally -- back on his white horse, inspecting “revolutionary battle sites” on a sacred mountain as Pyongyang foreshadowed a major policy decision later this month. Simon Denyer and Min Joo Kim report: “The images of Kim on horseback, returning to Mount Paektu after a similar visit in October, were high on symbolism. But it was a second, more dryly worded announcement on Wednesday that was at least as significant. The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided to convene the fifth plenary meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in the latter part of December, the Korean Central News Agency said, ‘to discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad.’ Put simply, after giving the United States until the end of the year to change its approach to denuclearization talks and warning that North Korea would follow a ‘new path,’ Kim appears to have made his decision on what that path should be, experts said.”

-- China criticized the U.S. House for passing a bill backing sanctions on Beijing over the mass detention of Muslims. Gerry Shih reports: “The Uighur Act cleared the House by 407 to 1 a week after [Trump] signed legislation that would sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials involved in human rights abuses in the protest-ridden financial hub. China has angrily denounced both measures and said Wednesday it would respond to the House’s passage of the Uighur Act, which must be reconciled with a Senate version passed in September before it reaches Trump’s desk. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged the United States to ‘immediately correct its mistake, stop the above bill on Xinjiang from becoming law, and stop using Xinjiang as a way to interfere in China’s domestic affairs.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- McKinsey, the consulting giant, has been helping to support the implementation of the Trump administration's immigration agenda. But some of their draconian suggestions for cost-cutting have been deemed as overly harsh, and even inhumane, by career ICE employees. From ProPublica and the New York Times: “ICE quickly redirected McKinsey toward helping the agency figure out how to execute the White House’s clampdown on illegal immigration. But the money-saving recommendations the consultants came up with made some career ICE workers uncomfortable. They proposed cuts in spending on food for migrants, as well as on medical care and supervision of detainees, according to interviews with people who worked on the project for both ICE and McKinsey and 1,500 pages of documents obtained from the agency after ProPublica filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. McKinsey’s team also looked for ways to accelerate the deportation process, provoking worries among some ICE staff members that the recommendations risked short-circuiting due-process protections for migrants fighting removal from the United States. The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — actions whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings.”

-- The Trump administration plans on cutting off food stamps benefits for about 750,000 Americans. From Bloomberg News: A new regulation will make it “harder for states to gain waivers from a requirement that beneficiaries work or participate in a vocational training program … The work requirement only applies to ‘able-bodied’ recipients who aren’t caring for a child under 6 years old. The measure would be the first of three Trump administration initiatives curtailing food stamp benefits to take effect. The Urban Institute estimated in an analysis last month that the measures together would cut 3.7 million beneficiaries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, often known by its previous name, food stamps.”

­-- The White House is torpedoing the bipartisan tradition of confirming nominees from both parties for positions at independent agencies. From the National Journal: “For decades, presidents have tapped Republican and Democratic nominees in tandem to fill open slots on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and many other independent bodies. But this week, senators are preparing to confirm Republican Robert Duncan to another term as chairman at one of those agencies, the United States Postal Service Board of Governors, without a Democratic companion.”

-- Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone resigned following accusations that he mishandled sex abuse cases. Chico Harlan reports: “Under Malone’s watch, Buffalo had become perhaps the U.S. Church’s most scandal-tainted diocese. It faces an FBI probe and more than 200 lawsuits. Malone pledged to institute reforms, but he was instead battered by accusations of coverup and by embarrassing leaks. One whistleblower said she found a 300-page dossier on accused priests hidden away in a supply closet near a vacuum cleaner. In a short statement, the Vatican said that Malone would be replaced on a temporary basis by Albany’s bishop, Edward Scharfenberger. Malone, 73, is departing two years before the mandatory age at which bishops must offer their retirements to Pope Francis — though many prelates stay on the job beyond the 75-year mark.”

-- Senate Republicans are poised to confirm either today or tomorrow a Trump judicial nominee who claimed that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave effects on society, including diminished respect for motherhood and the unique mother-child bond; exploitation of women; commodification of gestation and of children themselves; and weakening of appropriate social mores against eugenic abortion.” HuffPost reports: “Sarah Pitlyk, [Trump’s] nominee to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, argued those points in a 2017 amicus brief opposing a California statute that protects the right to assisted reproductive technology like in vitro fertilization, or IVF, and gestational surrogacy. Pitlyk … went on to say in a 2017 interview with the National Catholic Register that ‘surrogacy is harmful to mothers and children, so it’s a practice society should not be enforcing.’ Nearly 1 in 6 U.S. couples face infertility, according to a 2014 National Institutes of Health study.

“Pitlyk, 42, fits the mold of many of Trump’s judicial nominees: She’s young, white and a member of the Federalist Society. … She defended anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, who broke federal and state laws by secretly recording and deceptively editing videos that falsely claimed to expose Planned Parenthood’s illegal sale of fetal tissue. She defended Iowa’s six-week abortion ban that was later struck down as unconstitutional. In another case, Pitlyk argued that it is ‘scientific fact’ that ‘human life begins at the moment when a human sperm fertilizes a human egg.’ (It is not scientific fact.)

“So far, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the only Republican who plans to oppose Pitlyk’s confirmation, meaning Pitlyk has the votes to be confirmed. In a statement, Collins cited Pitlyk’s ‘troubling assertions’ about fertility treatments. … Collins also raised concerns with Pitlyk earning a rare and embarrassing “not qualified” rating by the American Bar Association based on her lack of experience. The rating was unanimously decided. … Pitlyk previously clerked for Brett Kavanaugh. … When Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Pitlyk came to his defense. … Pitlyk also publicly dismissed Ford’s story, saying in a CNN interview that it was ‘hard to take it seriously…’”

-- Describing it as an “untamed beast” in “distress,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos wants to spin off the Federal Student Aid office into a new agency. Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports: “The proposal follows a series of missteps involving the office that intensified scrutiny of DeVos’s leadership, including the release of $11 million in loans to unaccredited for-profit colleges and the violation of a court order to halt collections on former Corinthian Colleges students. … Policy experts have questioned whether the office has the economic expertise to meet the challenge and have recommended changes, but they have stopped short of calling for anything on the scale of what DeVos is proposing. … The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators has long urged Congress to review whether the Federal Student Aid office is subject to enough supervision by the education secretary. DeVos referred to the trade group’s past critiques of the office in her speech Tuesday, but the group’s president, Justin Draeger, noted that spinning off the unit was never among its recommendations.”

-- The Supreme Court seems skeptical that Superfund landowners can seek a more extensive cleanup than what the Environmental Protection Agency has approved. Robert Barnes reports: ""The court was considering a massive cleanup of arsenic from a 300-square-mile section of Montana where a copper smelter operated for nearly 100 years. The Anaconda valley has been a Superfund cleanup site since 1983, and owner Atlantic Richfield already has spent more than $470 million to remove toxic chemicals from the land. But nearly 100 homeowners in the area want more work done, and they went to state court in hopes of convincing a jury that the company should pay an additional $50 million to reduce the arsenic level in the ground. The Montana Supreme Court said the suit could proceed. But the question for the U.S. Supreme Court was whether such a supplemental lawsuit undermines the EPA’s authority to implement a cleanup plan it deems appropriate for all parties.”

-- New York City is shipping its homeless to squalid housing out of the state, officials in Newark allege in a new lawsuit. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The complaint, which names the city of New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks as defendants, accuses the city’s Special One-Time Assistance program, or SOTA, of violating commerce laws by pushing recipients into Newark apartments that are not suitable for living and sometimes illegal. The suit comes amid a national battle to mitigate a national homeless crisis that has left many of the country’s urban areas desperate for answers.”

-- Rep. Steve Watkins (R-Kan.) is facing perjury and voter fraud allegations for listing a UPS store as his home residence. From the Topeka Capital-Journal: “Shawnee County records show the first-term Republican listed his official residence as 6021 S.W. 29th St. in Topeka, which corresponds to a UPS Store, when he signed a form to change his residency for voter registration purposes in August, signed an application for a mail-in ballot in October and signed a document to complete advance voting for the November election. It isn’t clear where the congressman physically resided in Kansas after August nor what Topeka precinct he was legally qualified to be part of when voting in November. By asserting his place of residence to be the UPS Store, Watkins left the Topeka City Council’s 5th District for the city council’s 8th District. He then cast a November ballot in an 8th District contest decided by 13 votes.”

-- The D.C. Council voted unanimously to recommend Jack Evans for expulsion over multiple ethics violations. Fenit Nirappil reports: “The action comes after a series of investigations that found Evans, the city’s longest-serving lawmaker, used his public office to benefit private clients and employers who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars. … A person who spoke to Evans on Tuesday afternoon said the lawmaker recognized his council tenure was over and was concerned about being the first member to be expelled but was not yet prepared to resign. … Evans has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. In a letter sent last week, Evans’s lawyers argued that expulsion would override the will of voters.”

Pete Buttigieg unveiled a proposal this morning to correct troubling health disparities among African Americans and Hispanics — a crucial constituency to win over to have any hope of securing the Democratic presidential nomination.

The South Bend, Ind., mayor's eight-page proposal pledged to even the playing field for minorities who typically have worse access to medical providers and much higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic health conditions compared with white Americans.

Buttigieg has surged in the polls to lead the Democratic primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he’s in trouble in subsequent primaries in Nevada and South Carolina, where strong support from African American voters has given former vice president Joe Biden a strong lead.

Buttigieg has been criticized for his handling of racially-charged incidents within his city’s police department and has only a smattering of endorsements from black or Hispanic elected officials. That could be a huge stumbling block for his campaign, considering no Democrat in the last three decades has secured the party's nomination without a majority of black support.

Even the Onion has mocked Buttigieg’s struggles:

Buttigieg is hoping to help correct this problem with promises to make the health of minorities — both through direct medical care and indirect aspects such as housing, food, education and access to clean water — a top priority.

He promises that in his first 100 days as president his administration would develop a “National Health Equity Strategy.” He also vows to help particular geographic areas combat the worst disparities and to support programs to train the health-care workforce to overcome racial bias when treating patients.

The disparities are particularly stark when it comes to life expectancy. A black man living in a rural community is likely to live seven years less than a white man living in a city. Black life expectancy at birth is about three and a half years lower than that of whites. The mortality gap between black and white Americans been cut in half since 1999, but the United States still has a long way to go before it’s eliminated.

“Millions of Americans today still find their health determined by who they are or where they live,” the paper says. “Systemic discrimination takes the form of a doctor who takes a Black person’s pain symptoms less seriously … it manifests in a hospital system that breaks ground only in a predominantly white neighborhood.”

The paper also calls for improvements in black maternal health, an area that has recently undergone increased scrutiny as celebrities including Beyoncé and Serena Williams have spoken out about their own struggles with pregnancy and childbirth. Black women are three to four times as likely to be at risk of pregnancy-related deaths as white women, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

It’s hard to overstate Buttigieg’s need to inspire confidence among black voters in particular. They’re only a tiny sliver of the electorate in the earliest primary states, but they’re much larger voting blocs in nearly every primary that comes after. Minorities comprise more than one-third of Democratic voters in the 16 states with primaries on March 3, known as “Super Tuesday.”

For now, Buttigieg is focusing on South Carolina. He’ll meet with Latino community leaders and locals in Okatie, S.C., at noon today to discuss health equity, a spokeswoman said. On Sunday, the mayor attended services at a church led by the Rev. William J. Barber II, who revived a campaign originally started by Martin Luther King Jr. to combat economic inequality.

Afterward, Buttigieg told reporters that he believes he is making progress with black voters, including those “who may yet not feel that they know me,” per the Associated Press.

“Part of what I’m trying to do is talk about these issues, including specific racial issues around voter suppression and systemic racism, in a way that helps everyone in the country understand why we all have a stake in dealing with it,” Buttigieg said.

The campaign is opening four offices and hiring 40 staffers in the state. The campaign launched its first ad there yesterday, spending $2 million on a spot that features the mayor listening to a racially diverse group of voters.

The ad:

By releasing yet another health-care proposal among the many coming out of his campaign over the last few months, he seems to be adopting the sort of “plan for everything” style his opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was first known for.

One of his other proposals is “Medicare for all who want it,” which would retain employer-sponsored coverage while allowing anyone to buy a public plan if they preferred. The approach, which the mayor rolled out over the summer, is strikingly similar to the public option plan championed by Biden — so much so, that Biden accused Buttigieg yesterday of stealing his idea.

“[Buttigieg] doesn’t have the enthusiasm and the moderate — moderate plan,” Biden said in an interview with Politico. “It’s the Biden plan.”

My colleague Matt Viser:

Biden says Buttigieg stole his heath care plan — and the media isn’t tough enough on him for it.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

(Susan Walsh/AP)

AHH: Three state lawmakers published op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all that were written with the help of lobbyists that either wrote drafts or made extensive edits, our Washington Post colleague Jeff Stein reports, citing emailed obtained by The Post.

Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) said op-eds they wrote about single-payer health proposals included language from lobbyist and consultant John MacDonald. Meanwhile, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) told The Post the lawmaker published an op-ed with assistance from lobbyist Kathleen Deland.

“None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist,” Jeff writes. “The emails show how, even at the state and local levels, lobbyists are trying to bend public opinion away from an idea that has seized much of the debate during the current Democratic presidential primary. … The documents were provided to The Post by the nonprofit advocacy group Medicare for All Now, which supports the single-payer system. The group obtained the documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.”

Jeff adds that neither of the consultants would say whether they had been hired by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a group that’s spent more than $1 million on ads warning against Medicare-for-all and other overhauls to the nation’s health-care system. A spokesman for the group also wouldn’t confirm or deny having hired MacDonald or Deland.

OOF: The stigma of addiction and criminal activity related to opioid abuse remains a barrier for victims seeking damages, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports, citing alleged victims, plaintiff lawyers and legal specialists.

“Prescription opioid abusers often are perceived to share the blame for the serious harm they experienced through addiction to prescription pills, recovering users contend,” he writes. “Unlike those injured by asbestos, medical implants or faulty automobile bags, courts have been reluctant to accept their claim that their addiction was the result of a dangerous, improperly marketed product.”

Christopher writes the settlement reached between OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and Oklahoma directed $200 million to the University of Oklahoma for a research and addiction treatment program, with another $12 million to local governments and $60 million for legal expenses.

“None of the settlement money was earmarked directly for victim compensation,” he writes. “Victim-compensation funds also have not yet been floated as part of the national-level settlements being negotiated by governments and manufacturers. The most tangible benefit for victims so far has been proposals for free anti-addiction and overdose-rescue drugs to individual communities.”

OUCH: About a fifth of adolescents ages 12 to 18 in the United States are now prediabetic, as are nearly a quarter of young adults ages 19 to 34, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The data found the rising rate of young people who are prediabetic, meaning their blood sugar levels are elevated but not quite high enough to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, means the age groups are at risk for developing the condition, CNN’s Michael Nedelman writes.

“Until recently, young children and teens almost never got type 2 diabetes, which is why it used to be called adult-onset diabetes,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Now, about one-third of American youth are overweight, a problem closely related to the increase in kids with type 2 diabetes, some as young as 10 years old.”

“Prediabetes was also more common among young people with obesity, which is also closely linked to Type 2 diabetes in adults. More than a quarter of obese adolescents and more than a third of obese young adults were found to have prediabetes — versus less than 17% of individuals with normal weight in both age groups,” Michael writes.

HEALTH ON THE HILL

— A bicameral group of Democrats have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that would require doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced the brief that includes 161 House Democrats and 36 Senate Democrats.

“Lawmakers said the case still represents a direct challenge to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, even though Louisiana and its supporters have not asked the Court to formally overturn Roe,” the Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel reports. “The Democrats said upholding Louisiana’s law would allow states to effectively eliminate abortion.”

“While Act 620 purports to improve women’s health and safety, the law will actually make it more difficult for women in Louisiana to obtain safe medical care,” the lawmakers wrote. “As with other statutes targeting abortion providers and facilities, the actual legislative intent here is to mandate requirements so difficult to fulfill that the inevitable outcome is the shuttering of abortion clinics and elimination of safe and legal abortions. Indeed, if Act 620 goes into effect, Louisiana will have only a single clinic providing abortion services in the entire state.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments for the case in March.

— Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) wants state lawmakers to work with her to halt the implementation of the state’s Medicaid work requirements amid concerns that people will lose health coverage, MLive.com’s Malachi Barrett reports.

“Starting next year, most able-bodied adults between the ages of 19-61 who are enrolled in Michigan’s Medicaid expansion will have to work an average of 20 hours per week or 80 hours per month,” Malachi writes. “Whitmer said pausing the ‘punitive’ requirements is the ‘most reasonable thing’ to prevent people from losing health care coverage.”

A coalition of state and national health groups last month filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop Michigan from implementing its work rules. Other legal challenges have been filed against work requirements in Kentucky, Arkansas and New Hampshire, as well as in Indiana, which said it would pause its requirements until the case is resolved.

President Trump risks tipping the United States — and the world — into recession if he presses ahead with tariffs on Chinese imports set to bite in just 11 days.

That’s the conclusion some economists are drawing after the president renewed trade tensions with Beijing by saying he was open to waiting until after the 2020 election to reach a deal some advisers recently described as imminent.

“The economy is on the precipice and this would just push us over into the abyss. I don’t think we’re very far from recession as it is,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi tells me.

Zandi sees a cascade effect ricocheting through the economy if the administration follows through on its threat to impose 15 percent import levies on $160 billion of Chinese goods, a list that includes laptops, cellphones, toys and other consumer goods. “It would just be too much,” he said of the tariffs planned for December 15. “It would undermine investor confidence, weaken business sentiment and the negative reinforcing dynamics of a recession would take hold.”

Investors are processing the renewed threat, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1 percent, its third straight day of losses and the steepest one-day sell-off since early October, as the Wall Street Journal’s Michael Wursthorn and Anna Isaac write.

Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said his firm projects the next round of tariffs would trim 0.2 percent from economic growth. “It’s not huge, but it’s one additional layer of drag on top of the tariffs we’ve already seen,” he said. “I would note the possibility that the loss of confidence from the private sector would exacerbate that.”

Daco says tariffs alone would be unlikely to precipitate a recession. But like Zandi he said they could ripple out dangerously if they depress business confidence, weighing on financial markets, reducing hiring and, ultimately, crimping consumer spending. “If we have an end of the year like last year,” with tariffs rising, a government shutdown looming, and the Federal Reserve signaling it won't help, Daco noted, “We’re starting off from a much lower point in activity now, and the risks of a recession going into 2020 are that much greater.”

How seriously to take the possibility the Trump team fails to reach an agreement with its Beijing counterparts that forestalls the tariffs remains uncertain. While in London for NATO's 70th anniversary summit, Trump said ""in some ways I like idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal."" Still, he noted that the Chinese ""want to make a deal now and we will see whether or not the deal is going to be right.""

But Bloomberg News reports despite the heated rhetoric, Washington and Beijing are moving closer to agreeing on how many tariffs already in force should be rolled back as part of a phase-one deal. And the WSJ's Bob Davis and Lingling Wei report the recent involvement of White House adviser Jared Kushner could indicate a deal is close-at-hand.

Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors, said his firm has been telling clients they believed the Dec. 15 deadline didn’t necessarily mean much: As long as the two sides were continuing to negotiate in good faith, the Trump team was likely to find a way to put them off. Now, he says, “it's fluid in the sense that Dec. 15 is starting to look like a harder deadline than it was, say, 48 hours ago. But that in and of itself can change.”

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to underscore the two sides still have difficult issues to resolve, and the U.S. feels no urgency to strike a deal. Ross told Reuters in an interview that the point Trump, in his comments at the NATO summit in London, “was trying to make is we need a proper deal, and whether it comes this December, or it’s next December, or some other date is much less important than getting a proper deal.”

“The important thing is to get a deal that works,” he said. “Because let’s face it, if we don’t make a deal with China now, it’s going to be a long, long time before there is a deal.”

Investors perceive a pattern they hope will play out again in the coming days: Trump tends to ramp up trade confrontations when the stock market is gaining steam and back off when it tumbles. The president was dismissive of the trade-induced selloff, calling it “peanuts.” And, he said, “I don’t watch the stock market.” The claim is belied by his own Twitter feed:

Trump: ""I don't watch the stock market."" pic.twitter.com/9BCb059zLE — Ivan the K™ (@IvanTheK) December 3, 2019

“There’s this binary moment in the market where people are freaking out, and there’s also a group that says, ‘He’s focused on reelection, and he knows how bad this would be for it, so he’ll pull back,’” Myrow says. “There’s a lot of post-hoc rationalization. But a lot of this comes down to what was on Fox News that morning, what did he have for breakfast, and what’s going on with impeachment.”

MARKET MOVERS

— All eyes on payrolls number. CNBC's Patti Domm: ""Wednesday’s report of ADP private payrolls could give clues on the labor market, the next part of the economy to be scrutinized after an important manufacturing report showed an unexpected decline. ADP is expected to show that 140,000 payrolls were added in September, following 195,000 in its report in August. That August number was not a good barometer for the much lower government report of just 96,000 private payrolls in August, but it will be watched nonetheless. Total payrolls were 130,000 in August, including government workers.""

— Investors look to fiscal stimulus. Bloomberg News's Gregor Stuart Hunter: ""The next push for the global economy may come from governments instead of central banks -- and the outcome for markets could be messy. Synchronized monetary easing helped keep global stocks and bonds afloat amid a succession of bruising trade disputes and geopolitical flare-ups in 2019. But the effect may tail off soon, and an array of government spending measures designed to fuel growth may produce much more divergent results.

""The outlook for markets in the next year varies 'drastically' from country to country in line with the ability of each to deploy fiscal stimulus, said Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. The result will be 'incredibly wide dispersion' for stock markets 'and quite a bit of volatility therein,' she said.""

— Post-Thanksgiving shopping was no turkey after all: “A record 189.6 million Americans went shopping over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said, and most of them did their spending online,” my colleague Abha Bhattarai reports.

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— Mexican official’s return signals possible USMCA momentum: “Mexican undersecretary for North America Jesús Seade is headed back to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this week, three people familiar with the plans told Politico,” Megan Cassella and Sabrina Rodríguez report.

“The meeting comes as the two sides are racing to wrap up a compromise on changes to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. After a flurry of meetings late last week involving Seade, Lighthizer and Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, the U.S. had asked Mexico for a response by [Tuesday], a fourth person closely following the talks said.”

— France fires back on possible tariffs: “The French government fired back Tuesday against the Trump administration’s threats to slap hefty tariffs on dozens of popular French products, insisting that the European Union would retaliate if the White House went through with its proposal,” my colleague James McAuley reports from Paris.

“Later in the day, President Trump suggested that some kind of compromise might be achievable, and French President Emmanuel Macron indicated his willingness to work toward one. This came hours after Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, vowed what he called a ‘strong European riposte’ to Trump’s proposed tariffs — as much as 100 percent on about $2.4 billion in imported goods, including wines, cheeses and certain designer clothes.”

Key quote: “We need to be pugnacious,” Agnès Pannier-Runacher, a junior economy minister, said speaking to France’s Sud Radio.

— Ross said imported auto tariffs might still be possible: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that “the Trump administration has not ruled out imposing tariffs on imported autos, after letting a review period end in November with no action,” Reuters’s David Shepardson reports.

“[Trump] did not announce any new tariffs after a six-month, self-imposed review period expired in mid-November following a Commerce Department investigation into whether imported autos pose a national security threat. He has threatened to tax them by as much as 25%.”

— Huawei could have been kicked out of U.S. banking system: “The Trump administration considered banning China’s Huawei from the U.S. financial system earlier this year as part of a host of policy options to thwart the blacklisted telecoms equipment giant, according to three people familiar with the matter,” Reuters’s Alexandra Alper reports.

“The plan, which was ultimately shelved, called for placing Huawei Technologies Co, the world’s second largest smartphone producer, on the Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. One of the people familiar with the matter, who favors the move, said it could be revived in the coming months depending on how things go with Huawei. The plan was considered by the White House National Security Council, and seen by officials as a nuclear option atop a ladder of policy tools to sanction the company, two of the people said. Such a designation can make it virtually impossible for a company to complete transactions in U.S. dollars.”

— Verizon CEO doesn’t want 5G “cold war”: “Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg told CNBC ... that he does not want geopolitical tensions around 5G technology to become further inflamed,” CNBC’s Kevin Stankiewicz reports.

“Asked whether he thought the fight between the U.S. and Chinese tech giant Huawei could result in a so-called 5G cold war, creating a fractured global network, Vestberg said, ‘I hope not.’ ”

The US can't use Cold War tactics to engage with China, says former NSA head Michael Rogers China's main goal is to achieve 21st century technological dominance, argued Admiral Michael Rogers, former head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, in a recent cybersecurity podcast. He also explained some of the tactics that are hard to counter, such as IP theft, government subsidies of tech companies, and linking corporate interests to education and government research. CNBC

“The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information.

— Massive change at Google's parent company: “Google co-founder Larry Page is stepping down as CEO of the search giant’s parent company in favor of Google CEO Sundar Pichai, marking a major shift for one of the world’s most valuable companies,” my colleague Greg Bensinger reports.

“Page and co-founder Sergey Brin will no longer be involved in day-to-day operations of Alphabet, the parent company, according to an announcement, though they will keep their board seats. Page has turned over the CEO role once before, in 2001, to Eric Schmidt, who held the post for nearly 10 years before handing the reins back to Page.”

What’s next: “Pichai inherits sole responsibility for a company buffeted by antitrust investigations and the ire of [Trump]. Under Pichai, Google has been trying to become more buttoned up, amid a series of leaks to the media and worker pushback. Some things will remain the same: Brin and Page hold a majority of the company’s voting stock, meaning major board decisions still need their stamp of approval.”

— India is changing the rules after tech giants bet big: “After Walmart Inc. sealed a $16 billion deal last year to buy India’s biggest domestic e-commerce startup, it got some bad news. India was changing its e-commerce regulations,” the Wall Street Journal’s Newley Purnell reports.

“Foreign-owned online retailers would need to modify their supply chains and stop deep discounting. Those rules didn’t apply to Indian companies. India, the world’s biggest untapped digital market, has suddenly become a much tougher slog for American and other international players.”

Where this push is coming from: “Seeking to match China’s success at protecting and promoting homegrown tech giants, such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and TikTok parent Bytedance Inc., India is increasingly trying to shelter domestic companies.”

“David McCormick, who has shared duties with Ms. Murray since 2017, will become sole CEO, the firm said. Bridgewater, which manages $160 billion in assets, said the change marks the end of founder Ray Dalio’s succession planning. That process has been marked by tumult. Mr. McCormick’s elevation represents the sixth change to Bridgewater’s chief-executive lineup since 2016.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Harris drops out: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris's “departure is the latest surprise in a Democratic primary that has repeatedly defied prediction, with several prominent senators, as well as candidates of color, struggling in a political landscape marked by anger, passion and a desperate Democratic desire to unseat Trump. The other early star of the campaign, former congressman Beto O’Rourke (D-Tex.), dropped out a month ago,” my colleague Chelsea Janes reports.

Why now?: “In a note to supporters, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. 'I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,' she wrote. 'My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.' ""

'I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,' she wrote. 'My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.' "" But the news came as a shock to some of Harris's biggest backers: Some of those supporters had “just announced a super PAC to support Harris’s candidacy. Some donors spent the day frantically trying to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars they had wired into the super PAC’s account. One of Harris’s biggest backers, Quinn Delaney, had even approved a large transfer of funds to pay for an Iowa television ad from the new super PAC — a fact unknown to the Harris staffers as they prepared to pull the plug.”

A parting blow: "" 'I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,' "" Harris wrote her letter, a not-so-subtle shot at former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and financier Tom Steyer.

THE BIG IDEA: What emails about Ukraine does President Trump think, or hope, will never get out?

During two interviews with FBI agents and members of Bob Mueller’s team last year, former White House communications director Hope Hicks recounted the president’s reaction to the discovery of damning emails about the meeting his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort took with a Russian emissary at Trump Tower in June 2016.

“Throughout Hicks’ conversations with Trump, it was clear to her that Trump did not think the emails would get out,” according to the FBI’s summary of her first interview, which was released on Monday night in response to an open-records lawsuit. “Hicks’ impression was Trump meant the emails would not get out to the press, but he did not say that explicitly.”

Hicks said she thought the messages would come out eventually and warned Trump that they would become “a massive” story.” She wanted “Junior” – as the FBI summaries refer to the president’s eldest son – to give an interview to a friendly media outlet, where he could take “softball questions,” to minimize the fallout. “The President said they should not do anything, asked why so many people had the emails, and said they needed to let the lawyers deal with it,” Hicks recalled to the FBI.

There are no fresh bombshells in these new summaries. The juiciest material appeared in Mueller’s 448-page report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the memos about Hicks’s FBI sit-downs, which both occurred in March 2018, offer a revealing window into how Trump tries to control bad news. Trump’s unwillingness to rip off the Band-Aid and get out in front of bad facts has resulted in a drip, drip, drip of revelations that have clouded most of his tenure in office.

-- Hicks’s comments are newly relevant against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry. The White House’s categorical refusal to comply with subpoenas for documents, from phone records to emails, has made it harder for investigators to corroborate sworn testimony from witnesses about the alleged campaign to coerce Ukraine’s new president to announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden in exchange for a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid that had already been approved by Congress.

A confidential White House review of Trump’s decision to freeze the aid has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, three of my colleagues reported last week. But none of those emails have been turned over to investigators.

Trump appointees at the departments of State, Energy and Defense have also defied subpoenas and refused to produce documents that get at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. They have justified doing so by making absolutist claims of presidential privilege that have led to protracted litigation in the courts. The White House is refusing to participate at all in the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing on Wednesday.

For her part, Ivanka Trump repeatedly conducted official government business on her personal email account throughout much of 2017, sending hundreds of emails in potential violation of federal recordkeeping rules. The White House adviser did so after her father made Hillary Clinton’s private email use as secretary of state a centerpiece of his stump speech, egging on crowds as they chanted “Lock her up.” The House Oversight Committee has unsuccessfully sought to subpoena Ivanka Trump’s emails.

-- House Democrats are also quietly debating whether they should expand articles of impeachment to include charges stemming from the Mueller report, including the episode Hicks discussed with the FBI. “Members of the House Judiciary Committee and other more liberal-minded lawmakers and congressional aides have been privately discussing the possibility of drafting articles that include obstruction of justice or other ‘high crimes’ they believe are clearly outlined in [the Mueller report] — or allegations that Trump has used his office to benefit his bottom line,” Rachael Bade reports. “The idea, however, is running into resistance from some moderate Democrats wary of impeachment blowback in their GOP-leaning districts, as well as Democratic leaders who sought to keep impeachment narrowly focused on allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals … The debate is expected to play out in leadership and caucus meetings this week.”

When the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks to appear for a closed-door interview this June about the possible instances of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report, the former White House communications director refused to answer any question related to her interactions with Trump after Election Day in 2016. Citing a directive from White House lawyers, Hicks declined to answer 155 different questions from lawmakers, according to a transcript.

-- BuzzFeed News and CNN filed lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of these FBI notes, known as “302 reports,” that were created as part of the two-year Mueller probe. The 295-page tranche that went out last night is quite repetitive, and the interviews are still mostly whited out. The media outlets pledged to challenge the heavy redactions as part of the ongoing litigation to obtain records.

Hicks left the White House last year and now works at the Fox Corporation in Los Angeles as a public relations executive. During another closed-door deposition in February 2018, while she was still employed by the White House, Hicks acknowledged that she occasionally told “white lies” for Trump. Hicks was advised at the beginning of both her interviews that it is a crime to lie to the FBI in the course of an investigation, which she acknowledged.

-- Hicks told the FBI agents that “Trump was angry, surprised, and frustrated” when Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May 2017. “The only other time she had seen Trump like that was when the Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign,” according to the FBI notes.

“Trump thought the fact that the intelligence community assessed the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election was his Achilles heel,” she added, according to the summary. “Even if it had no impact on the election, Trump thought that was what people would think. He thought the assessment took away from what he did.”

-- Hicks was treated like family during her time as a member of the Trump inner circle. The president referred to her affectionately as “Hopey.” He called her more often than his chief of staff at the time. The onetime fashion model from Greenwich, Conn., whose dad was a top executive at the NFL, was tight with the president’s kids, who she had gotten to know during her work for the Trump Organization before the presidential campaign.

That’s how she ended up in the White House residence on the morning of June 22, 2017, with only Trump, Kushner and Ivanka Trump. “Kushner had a manila folder with documents with him and said to the President that they had found one thing that the President should know about, but it was not a big deal,” according to Hicks’ account. “Kushner told Trump that he, Don Jr. and Paul Manafort had attended a meeting during the campaign. When he started to open the folder, Hicks said, the president stopped him and said he did not want to know about it.” Hicks believed Kushner’s folder included emails about the June 2016 meeting.

The next week, on June 28, Kushner asked Hicks and his spokesman Josh Raffel to go to the offices of someone whose name has been redacted (perhaps a lawyer) to review documents. “Hicks was shocked by the emails concerning the meeting she and Raffel reviewed,” the FBI write-up says. “She thought they looked really bad.”

The next day, on June 29, Hicks joined Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the president in his personal dining room to discuss about the emails. “Hicks’ initial reaction was that they should get in front of the emails,” according to the FBI summary. “Kushner responded that it wasn’t a big deal, just a meeting about Russian adoption. Kushner reminded the president that he had previously mentioned a meeting, and the President said he did not want to know about it.”

When Hicks said the story was going to become “massive,” the FBI summary says, “the President did not want to talk about it and did not want details.” Trump then asked Kushner when his document production was due. Kushner told him it would be a couple of weeks. “Then leave it alone,” Trump told Kushner, according to Hicks.

Fast forward a week to July 7. Kushner and Ivanka Trump came to Hicks’s hotel room in Germany to confer about how to respond to a story the New York Times was working on about the Trump Tower meeting. The next day, while they were all at the G-20 summit, Hicks alerted Trump about what the Times was chasing. The president told her not to comment.

Hicks and Trump talked again later that day. “The President asked what the meeting was about. Hicks told him Kushner and Junior had told her the meeting was about Russian adoption,” according to the FBI summary. “The President said words to the effect of, ‘Then just say that,’ and dictated what she should say.”

When they got to Air Force One for the flight back, one of Junior’s representatives texted Hicks the statement that the president’s son wanted to provide to the media. “She took that to the President’s cabin and read him Junior’s statement,” according to the FBI summary. “He told her they should not respond. Hicks advocated for providing the full story. The President did not say what was wrong with Junior’s statement, but just felt they were giving the media too much. … After meeting with Trump about Junior’s statement, Hicks returned to a seat and started texting with Junior. They worked on the statement for a period and ultimately settled on the statement that went to the press.”

During that flight back to Washington, Hicks also went to Trump’s cabin to tell him that then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus knew about the emails. There are four redacted paragraphs about what happened next.

-- A reminder of what was in the emails: British music publicist Rob Goldstone, who Don Jr. knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, emailed the candidate’s son to say that he knew a person who wanted “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone explained: “This is part of Russia and its government’s support of Trump”

“[I]f it’s what you say I love it,” Don Jr. replied, “especially later in the summer.”

That’s how the Trump Tower meeting got set up. It wasn’t adoption.

During the transition, Hicks told reporters in a statement that the Trump campaign had “no contact” with “any foreign entity,” including the Russians. She told the FBI that she recalled talking about this with fellow advisers Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Jason Miller and “probably” Kushner. “Hicks told the group she was planning to respond to the press and there was no hesitation or pushback from any of them,” according to the FBI notes.

-- Other takeaways from the FBI notes released last night:

1. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, told FBI agents in November 2018 that he informed Trump during the campaign that he had spoken with a “woman from the Kremlin” about the plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. “Cohen told Trump he spoke with a woman from the Kremlin who had asked specific and great questions about Trump Tower Moscow, and that he wished Trump Organization had assistants that were that good and competent,” according to the FBI summary.

“He also said that in his letter to Congress about the development, he initially wrote that he had ‘limited contact with Russian officials.’ But that line was struck from the letter. Cohen said he did not know who specifically struck it,” BuzzFeed notes. “It was the decision of the JDA to take it out,” the document says, referring to lawyers from the Joint Defense Agreement who represented the Trump family, Cohen, and Kushner, “and Cohen did not push back.” Cohen also told the FBI that he spoke with Trump’s attorney Jay Sekulow about pardons after his home and office were raided. Sekulow told the AP that Cohen's statements were false.

2. Former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates told the FBI that, if Rudy Giuliani had been the attorney general, some in the president’s orbit believed he wouldn't have recused himself, as Jeff Sessions did, from the Russia investigation. “After the recusal, he recalled conversations where people offered their opinion that had Rudy Giuliani been attorney general, he would not have recused himself,” according to the FBI summary. “Gates knew Giuliani had been the first choice for attorney general, but turned it down because he wanted to be Secretary of State instead.”

3. Former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein told the FBI he was “angry, ashamed, horrified and embarrassed” at how Jim Comey was fired as FBI director. “Rosenstein said he was asked during a White House meeting one day before Comey’s firing to produce a memo laying out his concerns with the FBI chief. He said he knew when he left the office that day that Comey would be fired, though he said he did not expect for his memo to be immediately released, and was surprised by the portrayal in the media that the termination was his idea instead of the White House’s,” the AP reports. “Rosenstein said he expected Comey would be contacted by either Trump or Sessions so a meeting could be scheduled and he could be fired in person. Comey instead learned of his firing from television while speaking with agents in Los Angeles.

“At one point during the interview, as Rosenstein was describing how he had ‘always liked Jim Comey’ but disagreed with his decisions in the Clinton case, the deputy attorney general ‘paused a moment, appearing to have been overcome by emotion, but quickly recovered and apologized,’ according to the FBI.”

-- The Post just published a six-part digital series to go along with the illustrated Mueller report. This is drawn directly from episodes detailed in the report in which prosecutors found possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as congressional testimony and Washington Post reporting. Dialogue is taken from text messages, contemporaneous notes and interviews conducted by Mueller’s team and the FBI. The digital project pairs with a graphic nonfiction book being published today by Scribner.

Attorney General William Barr listens as Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Nov. 26. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Attorney General Bill Barr has told associates he disagrees with the Justice Department’s inspector general on one of the key findings in an upcoming report about the FBI’s Russia investigation. Barr appears to disagree “that the FBI had enough information in July 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign,” Devlin Barrett and Karoun Demirjian scoop. “The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horo­witz, is due to release his long-awaited findings in a week, but behind the scenes at the Justice Department, disagreement has surfaced about one of Horowitz’s central conclusions on the origins of the Russia investigation. … The inspector general report, currently in draft form, is being finalized after input from various witnesses and offices that were scrutinized by the inspector general. Barr or a senior Justice Department official could submit a formal letter as part of that process, which would then be included in the final report.”

-- The Ukrainian government became aware of Trump’s freeze on military aid in July, according to former deputy foreign minister Olena Zerkal. From the Times: “‘We had this information,’ Ms. Zerkal said in an interview. ‘It was definitely mentioned there were some issues.’ … Ms. Zerkal’s account is the first public acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official that senior figures in Kyiv knew about the aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and that the Zelensky administration sought to keep that fact from surfacing to avoid getting drawn into the American impeachment debate. She said her own government blocked a trip she had planned to Washington to meet members of Congress in October, worried she would discuss matters related to impeachment and drag its president into an inquiry he has been eager to avoid. ‘They worried about this,’ she said of Mr. Zelensky’s advisers. ‘They said, ‘This is not the time for you to travel to D.C.’’ The cancellation of her trip was confirmed by Congressional aides.”

-- The Ukraine pressure campaign began as an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation. Rosalind S. Helderman reports: “As 2018 came to a close, the special counsel investigation was bearing down on [Trump.] … It was in this uncertain moment that [Giuliani] said he had the idea to focus on Ukraine. … The direct connection between the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine pressure campaign, often lost as the administration has reeled from controversy to controversy, shows the deep imprint the Russia investigation has had on the president. … Giuliani has repeatedly said the public does not appreciate the extent to which his work in Ukraine was driven by the Mueller investigation, rather than — as Democrats have alleged — as an effort to bolster Trump’s 2020 reelection.”

-- The Senate Intelligence Committee already investigated allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 campaign. From Politico: “Trump’s allies have defended his demand for political investigations from Ukraine by claiming that the government in Kyiv tried to sabotage his candidacy … But the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee thoroughly investigated that theory, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry, and found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016. The committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in October 2017 that the panel would be examining ‘collusion by either campaign during the 2016 elections.’ But an interview that fall with the Democratic consultant at the heart of the accusation that Kyiv meddled, Alexandra Chalupa, was fruitless, a committee source said, and Republicans didn’t follow up or request any more witnesses related to the issue.”

-- House Republicans said Trump acted out of “genuine” concern about corruption in Ukraine and wariness about foreign aid in a preemptive rebuttal to Democratic allegations that Trump abused his power. Mike DeBonis reports: “In a 123-page draft report, GOP investigators assert that Democrats failed to make the case that Trump committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors ... Nor, the Republicans say, do Democrats have a basis for impeachment in Trump’s decision to spurn House document requests and witness subpoenas pertaining to Trump’s Ukraine dealings. Instead, the draft GOP report contends, the impeachment effort is ‘an orchestrated campaign to upend our political system’ … The Republican report will serve as an initial blueprint for the GOP defense of Trump…”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the majority’s report will be released publicly today. “We are putting the finishing touches on the report,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. The panel is scheduled to vote this evening to approve its public release ahead of tomorrow’s Judiciary hearing.

-- Federal prosecutors will probably bring more charges against Giuliani’s associates Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas. From NPR: “A superseding indictment — which could add to or modify the existing charges — is likely, prosecutors said on Monday, but also adding that they're continuing to evaluate the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and FBI investigators are making their way through what prosecutor Douglas Zolkind called a ‘voluminous’ amount of evidence in the case — around 9 gigabytes' worth. Clearing their way through that material — which includes electronic devices, phone records, bank records and more — would set the stage for the next steps.”

-- The IRS whistleblower who raised concerns about political interference in the presidential audit program declined to voluntarily appear for a transcribed interview with the Senate Finance Committee, possibly because he was threatened with retaliation by his superiors. From CNN: “After raising concerns over the summer, the whistleblower met in November with Republican and Democratic staffers on the committee but has declined an invitation to appear for a follow-up … [T]he whistleblower declined the transcribed interview after an official informed the whistleblower that it could be considered a violation of IRS code to provide the committee with any information related to an individual taxpayer. Under IRS code 6103, IRS employees can be fired, fined or even jailed for disclosing taxpayer information. It is unclear what next step the committee will take. One option would be to issue a subpoena, but it is not clear that is the route the committee would take.”

Duncan Hunter leaves federal court after a hearing in San Diego.(Denis Poroy/AP)

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) plans to plead guilty to misusing campaign funds at a hearing set for 1 p.m. Eastern. “I think it’s important not to have a public trial for three reasons. And those three reasons are my kids,"" Hunter said in an interview with San Diego-based TV station KUSI. In July, federal prosecutors alleged that the congressman used campaign donations to finance extramarital affairs -- including trips, dinners and drinks -- with at least five women, including three lobbyists, a woman who worked in his congressional office and another who worked for a member of House leadership. Hunter told the local TV station that he “did make mistakes” but that “not a single dime of taxpayer money is involved in this.” He said he will plead guilty to only one of four counts against him as part of the deal. ""Whatever my time in custody is, I will take that hit,"" he said.

When he was first indicted last summer, Hunter called this a politically motivated witch hunt and said he was looking forward to the trial so he could fully vindicate himself. Initially, Hunter and his wife were charged with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including family vacations, theater tickets and school tuition. The couple allegedly agreed in electronic communications to claim that some of the expenses were intended to help veterans, even though they weren't. Then, in June, Margaret Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with her husband to spend $25,000 in campaign funds for personal use. As part of the plea deal, she flipped on her husband and agreed to testify against him.

Today's plea deal means that the first two members of Congress to endorse Trump for president in 2016 will be convicted criminals. Hunter and Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) came out for Trump in February of that year, about a week before Jeff Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump. Earlier this year, Collins resigned from Congress and pleaded guilty to insider trading charges. The crime he confessed to occured while he was standing on the White House lawn at a picnic hosted by Trump. These episode underscore just how swampy Trump's Washington has been.

Hunter didn't say whether he will resign as part of the plea deal, but that seems like a safe assumption. He's already facing serious primary challenges from former congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and former San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio, Felicia Sonmez notes. Hunter won the congressional seat after his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., retired from it to run for president in 2008.

-- The North Dakota company that Trump urged military officials to hire for border wall construction received a $400 million contract to build a span of new barriers across an Arizona wildlife refuge. Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report: “North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel won the contract to build in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in Yuma County, Ariz., the Defense Department said, with a target completion date of Dec. 30, 2020. Trump has repeatedly pushed for Fisher to get a wall-building contract, urging officials with the Army Corps of Engineers to pick the firm — only to be told that Fisher’s bids did not meet standards. Trump’s entreaties on behalf of the company have concerned some officials who are unaccustomed to a president getting personally involved in the intricacies of government contracting.

""Trump has been enamored with Tommy Fisher, the company’s chief executive, who has made multiple appearances on Fox News to promote his firm and insists that it would do a better job than those the government had already chosen. ... Fisher has worked with some Trump allies — including former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach and ex-White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon — to build border fencing on private land using private donations. ... Trump has pledged to complete 450 to 500 miles of new border barriers by the end of next year. So far his administration has built about 85 miles of fencing, almost all of it in areas where tall steel bollards are replacing smaller, older structures that were there before he took office.""

-- A new biography of Melania Trump by CNN’s Kate Bennett reveals that the first lady doesn't just live in her own bedroom. She actually lives on a different floor of the White House than the president: “Melania Trump has her own quarters in the White House. ... It is true the first couple doesn't share a bedroom, according to several sources, and the first lady prefers her own large, private space in a suite of rooms on a separate floor.” Bennett also reveals that the first lady was “beside herself with guilt” after her speech at the Republican National Convention was criticized for including parts from a speech given by Michelle Obama: “Not only did Melania Trump feel badly for her speechwriter, she also felt she had let down her husband on what should have been her most triumphant speaking engagement to date. The truth was, sources conclude, it was Donald Trump that let down Melania Trump. A skeleton staff of political neophytes neglected to read Melania Trump's speech, much less vet it for content.”

-- According to the new book, the first lady suspects that longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone was behind the release of nude photos from her modeling days during the 2016 campaign. From the Guardian: “Bennett also writes that the first lady ‘still refuses to believe’ her husband played a role in the release. ... Stone denied Bennett’s claim while the White House poured scorn on her book.”

-- The Supreme Court heard a Second Amendment case for the first time in a decade, but the debate ended up being on whether a case concerning gun restrictions is still worth considering. Robert Barnes reports: “The controversy involves now-rescinded restrictions unique to New York City about whether citizens who have a license to keep a gun in their homes may transport them to firing ranges outside of the city or to a second home in the state. After the Supreme Court took the case to decide whether those restrictions violated the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the city got rid of them. Then the state of New York passed a law that would keep them from being reenacted. The unstated purpose of both the city and state actions might have been to make the case moot and deny conservatives on the court a chance to explore whether there is a right to carry a gun outside the home. … The arguments Monday suggested that New York would have had trouble defending the old regulations. But most of the hour-long discourse was consumed with questions about whether the court still has a live controversy before it, a requirement for rendering an opinion. The court denied New York’s earlier plea to dismiss the case as moot. It said it would consider the question after argument.”

-- Barr's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to let federal executions proceed next week by “setting aside” a district court’s injunction that blocks it from carrying out lethal injections as planned. Mark Berman reports: “This request, which came hours after an appeals court blocked a similar application, marked an escalation of the administration’s push to restart federal executions after a nearly two-decade hiatus. …. The Justice Department argued in its 38-page filing Monday that the judge’s interpretation of the law is ‘implausible.’ The filing, signed by Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, dismissed what it called a ‘flawed injunction against the implementation of lawful executions.’ [Barr], in announcing plans to resume executions, had said the department owes it to victims to carry out the sentences, though some relatives of the first inmate facing execution have urged the administration to call off the lethal injection and sentence him to life in prison instead.”

-- Trump recently gave states the power to ban refugees. But deeply conservative and devout Utah wants more of them. Griff Witte reports: “The governor, a Republican who aligns with Trump on most issues, wrote the president a letter in late October. He didn’t want to keep refugees out. He didn’t want to reduce their numbers. He wanted Trump to send more. ‘We empathize deeply with individuals and groups who have been forced from their homes and we love giving them a new home and a new life,’ Gov. Gary R. Herbert wrote. Such newcomers, he added, have become ‘productive employees and responsible citizens.’ They have been an asset to Utah, he said, not a liability. Republicans in the state legislature quickly backed up their governor, daring to defy a president who has repeatedly shown an unwillingness to tolerate intraparty dissent. So did Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation. So did Republicans in city halls. Democrats across Utah added their support. ‘I have to be honest: I don’t have any idea why it’s a partisan issue nationally. It’s never been one here,’ said Brad Wilson, the state’s Republican speaker of the House. ‘Regardless of political party, we value these people.’”

-- Ballroom dancers say a clampdown on immigration is hurting business. From the AP: “When no Americans replied to her ads seeking a dance instructor, studio owner Chris Sabourin looked overseas. But she was stymied again by a federal tightening of visa application rules she and others contend is hampering the ballroom dance industry. … Federal records ... show a slight uptick since 2017 in initial denials of O-1 visa applications from individuals with 'extraordinary ability or achievement' — the visa that many of the foreign dancers seek — as well as for O-1 visa applicants who were given a second chance to meet eligibility requirements. Representatives of the dance industry say they’ve seen the processing times for those nonimmigrant visas, which allow the dancers to work in the U.S. for up to three years, increase from weeks to months, with uncertainty the application will be approved.”

-- A janitor working for the Border Patrol saved and photographed migrants’ belongings that were thrown away by U.S. officials. From the Los Angeles Times: “While working as a janitor at the same facility from 2003 to 2014, photographer Tom Kiefer secretly collected the belongings and later began shooting them. … The first items to pull Kiefer’s attention were 15 to 20 toothbrushes. At the time, he didn’t think about photographing them. He just felt compelled to remove them from the trash. ‘When I started seeing a rosary, or a Bible, or a wallet, I realized that no one would believe me if I had not collected these items.’ It took about six years of collecting — blankets, cellphones, toilet paper, depression medication, shoelaces — before Kiefer began photographing. … Kiefer estimates he has more than 100,000 items collected and stored in his studio and other spaces around Ajo. The word he uses to describe how he copes with the magnitude of his collection: compartmentalize. … ‘Our government is actually taking away a Bible or rosary,” he said. “I mean, how twisted is that?’”

-- The United Auto Workers has bolstered its financial controls in an effort to prevent embezzlement and bribery that was uncovered as part of a federal probe of the union. From the AP: “The moves announced Monday by Secretary-Treasurer Ray Curry come after last month’s resignation of President Gary Jones, who has been implicated in the scandal. Several other union officials have been charged or implicated in the probe, which embarrassed the union leadership and angered many of its 400,000 members when it became public starting in 2017. Curry says the reforms will put checks and balances in place to prevent financial misconduct.”

-- Former president Jimmy Carter was hospitalized again to treat a urinary tract infection. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The Carter Center says ‘he is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon.’ The incident comes three weeks after Carter was hospitalized ahead of a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by a subdural hematoma, a collection of blood outside the brain, spurred by his recent falls. He was released from the hospital on Wednesday, in time for Thanksgiving, and there were no complications from the surgery.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Cracks in the Greenland ice sheet are producing massive waterfalls, raising scientists’ concerns for sea level rise. Andrew Freedman reports: “A cerulean lake consisting of glacial meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, located about 18 miles from where the Store Glacier meets the sea in west Greenland, briefly became one of the world’s tallest waterfalls during the course of five hours in July 2018. The waterfall, like many others on the ice sheet’s surface, was triggered by cracks in the ice sheet. In the case of this one meltwater lake that scientists closely observed in July 2018, the water cascaded more than 3,200 feet to the underbelly of the glacier, where the ice meets bedrock. There, the water can help lubricate the base of the ice sheet, helping the ice move faster toward the sea. The observations of scientists, armed with aerial drones and other high-tech equipment, of the partial lake drainage that resulted could help researchers better understand how surface melting of the ice sheet could affect its melt rate, and improve global sea level rise projections.

“Scientists are keenly interested in how meltwater on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet — the largest contributor to global sea level rise — acts to speed up the movement of ice toward the sea by lubricating the underside of the ice surface. The new study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that scientists are underestimating the number of melt ponds that partially, and rapidly, drain into the ice sheet each year. This means tweaks may be needed to the computer models used to predict sea level rise from Greenland. This is the first study to show that partial lake drainage can occur through cracks in the ice, rather than overtopping or other mechanisms, which was previously the assumption. This means even more water is reaching the base of the ice sheet than previously thought.”

-- Trump revved up his global trade war yesterday by not only announcing tariffs on metals from Brazil and Argentina, but also by threatening even harsher penalties on dozens of popular French products. David J. Lynch, Rachel Siegel and Terrence McCoy report: “The administration said the moves were necessary because U.S. trading partners were acting unfairly to disadvantage both the country’s traditional economic pillars as well as its best hopes for future prosperity. … The unexpected announcement upends the Latin American countries’ 2018 agreement with Trump to accept quotas on their shipments to the United States instead of the import taxes. … Later, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, released the results of a five-month investigation that concluded a French digital services tax discriminated against American Internet companies and should be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion in products such as cheese, yogurt, sparkling wine and makeup. The proposal, which awaits a presidential decision, threatens to intensify simmering transatlantic trade friction …

“Fallout from the president’s renewed embrace of tariffs could cloud prospects for future or ongoing talks with countries in Asia and Europe. … Administration officials worry that the French tax could set a precedent for other countries. Lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in Austria, Italy and Turkey. … The president’s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy. … Typically, the United States provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes, delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at American ports without being taxed. But the president tweeted that his tariff order was ‘effective immediately.’”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, hit with the new tariffs, has learned the hard way what so many others have discovered before him: A good personal relationship with Trump has its limits. David Nakamura and Anne Gearan report: “Bolsonaro and his country’s diplomats in Washington were blindsided after Trump issued a pair of early morning tweets announcing punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports … For Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who had patterned his campaign after Trump’s and aggressively sought to ingratiate himself with the White House, the tariffs represented an embarrassing reality check on his strategy of gambling his administration's foreign policy largely on good personal chemistry with a president who craves validation — but who views virtually all relationships as transactional and, potentially, disposable.”

-- This is not the first time that Bolsonaro has gotten burned by Trump. Terrence McCoy reports: “Over and over in recent months, Bolsonaro has been surprised and stung by Trump’s slights and about-faces. Trump told Bolsonaro this year he would back Brazil’s bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a promise Bolsonaro then touted as a political achievement. But then the U.S. recommendation letter leaked, showing that the Trump administration was supporting Romania and Argentina for membership, not Brazil. A few weeks later, the U.S. government refused Bolsonaro’s request to lift its ban on Brazilian imports of beef over safety concerns — again taking his administration by surprise. Now Trump is targeting one of the most important industries in Brazil, at a time when unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled.”

-- Stocks sank amid disappointing manufacturing and construction data and Trump’s escalating trade wars. Taylor Telford and Thomas Heath report: “‘All this trade friction is weighing on the manufacturing sector, reminding us that protectionism is not a victimless crime,’ said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Nine of 11 stock market sectors declined Monday, with industrials, information technology and real estate leading the slide. All but seven of the Dow 30 blue chips finished in negative territory, with Boeing, American Express and United Technologies the biggest drags.”

-- The Trump administration quietly released more than $100 million in military assistance to Lebanon after months of unexplained delays that led some lawmakers to compare it to the frozen aid for Ukraine that prompted the impeachment inquiry. From the AP: “The $105 million in Foreign Military Financing funds for the Lebanese Armed Forces was released just before the Thanksgiving holiday and lawmakers were notified of the step on Monday, according to two congressional staffers and an administration official. … The money had languished in limbo at the Office of Management and Budget since September although it had already won congressional approval and had overwhelming support from the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council. The White House has yet to offer any explanation for the delay despite repeated queries from Congress.”

-- China is using DNA to map faces as Beijing’s pursuit of control over a Muslim ethnic group continues pushing the rules of science and consent. From the Times: “With a million or more ethnic Uighurs and others from predominantly Muslim minority groups swept up in detentions across Xinjiang, officials in Tumxuk have gathered blood samples from hundreds of Uighurs — part of a mass DNA collection effort dogged by questions about consent and how the data will be used. In Tumxuk, at least, there is a partial answer: Chinese scientists are trying to find a way to use a DNA sample to create an image of a person’s face. The technology, which is also being developed in the United States and elsewhere, is in the early stages of development and can produce rough pictures good enough only to narrow a manhunt or perhaps eliminate suspects. But given the crackdown in Xinjiang, experts on ethics in science worry that China is building a tool that could be used to justify and intensify racial profiling and other state discrimination against Uighurs.”

-- North Korea said that dialogue with the U.S. has been nothing but a “foolish trick” and warned Washington that it could be on the receiving end of an unwelcome Christmas gift. Simon Denyer reports: “The North Korean regime has given the United States until the end of the year to drop its ‘hostile policy,’ come up with a new approach to talks and offer concessions in return for its decision to end nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in 2018. But a recent decision by the United States to postpone a joint air drill with South Korea clearly hasn’t satisfied Pyongyang. Ri Thae Song, vice foreign minister in charge of U.S. affairs, accused Washington of trying to buy time by calling for a ‘sustained and substantial dialogue,’ but he rejected this approach. … ‘The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,’ he said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency. ‘What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.’ North Korea has a history of timing launches with an eye on international developments and even U.S. holidays.”

-- On the first day of the NATO Summit, Trump slammed French President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of NATO as “very, very nasty” and “disrespectful.” Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: Referring to comments Macron made “last month in an interview with The Economist — in which Macron described the ‘brain death’ of NATO due to lack of American support — Trump attacked Macron during his first remarks on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London, calling the comments ‘very insulting.’ ‘You just can’t go around making statements like that about NATO,’ Trump said, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders Tuesday morning. Though Trump himself has long been a vocal critic of NATO — a combative stance that has alarmed Western allies and seemed to prompt Macron’s comments — Trump took umbrage at the French assessment of the alliance, and depicted France as the beneficiary of American largesse. ‘I would say that nobody needs NATO more than France,’ Trump said.”

-- Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pair of bills. One requires all consumer electronic devices sold in the country to be pre-installed with Russian software. Another will require individual journalists to register as foreign agents. From Fox News: “Government officials say the law will help Russian IT firms compete with foreign companies, which dominate Russia’s mobile phone market, Reuters reported. Another law signed by Putin Monday is a bill that gives the government the right to register bloggers, journalists and social media users as foreign agents. The bill is an extension of an existing law adopted in response to the U.S. Justice Department’s 2017 decision to label the Russian state-funded network RT as a foreign agent. The new law applies to anyone who distributes content produced by media outlets registered as foreign agents and receives payments from abroad. Individuals registered as foreign agents will be subject to additional government scrutiny.”

-- The American woman who claims convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with Britain’s Prince Andrew told the BBC that the episodes were “disgusting” and asked for support from the British public. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “‘This is not some sordid sex story, this is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse, and this is a story of your guys’ royalty,’ Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC in an hour-long documentary that aired Monday night. … Giuffre — now 35 and a mother of three — told the BBC that she was passed around to Epstein’s rich and powerful friends ‘like a platter of fruit.’ She said she was trafficked to Andrew three times in 2001 and 2002: once in London at the home of Epstein’s girlfriend, once at Epstein’s New York mansion and once on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. ‘It didn’t last long,’ she said of the first of three alleged encounters with the prince. ‘He got up, and he said thanks, I sat there in bed, just horrified and ashamed and felt dirty,’ Giuffre said.” The prince has denied that he had sex with her.

-- The rape and killing of a veterinarian on her way home from work have shaken India. Joanna Slater reports: “The killing of the 26-year-old veterinarian in the South Indian city of Hyderabad last week has provoked outrage and anguish across India, the latest in a series of gruesome, high-profile crimes against women and girls. Police arrested four men and said they had confessed to the killing. Speaking in Parliament on Monday, India’s defense minister called it an ‘inhuman’ crime that has ‘brought shame to the entire country.’ … After news of the veterinarian’s killing spread, demonstrations erupted in Hyderabad over the weekend. Thousands of people protested at a police station near where the woman’s body was found and outside the gated compound where her family lives. In New Delhi, a young woman was arrested for holding a sign in a high-security area outside Parliament that read, ‘Why can’t I feel safe in my own India?’”

-- The Pacific island nation of Samoa will shut down government services for two days so civil servants can focus on a nationwide immunization drive as the country struggles to end a measles outbreak that has so far claimed more than 50 lives, most of them children. From NPR: “Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi announced the closure on Monday, saying the government is relying on ‘village councils, faith-based organizations, and church leaders, village mayors and government women representatives’ to persuade the public to get vaccinated. As a result, he said, all but public utility government services will be shuttered Dec. 5 and 6. More than 3,700 measles cases have been reported since the outbreak began in October, with 198 recorded within a 24-hour period. Fifty-three people have died and of those, 48 are children under 4 years old.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden may lose the Iowa caucuses. But, by betting on strong support from black voters in Southern states and urban areas, he may still secure the 1,990 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. From the Times: “If Mr. Biden retains his strength with black voters, he’d have a structural advantage in the nomination race that is greater than his uneven lead in national polls suggests. … While Iowa and New Hampshire may generate political momentum for a winner because they vote first, the two states award very few delegates. By contrast, a candidate who is popular in California, Texas and predominantly black districts in the South could pick up big shares of delegates. A recent poll shows Mr. Biden at 44 percent among black voters in South Carolina, the early voting state with a majority-black Democratic electorate, and a historic harbinger for how the South will vote. The same poll had Mr. Biden’s next closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trailing him by more than 30 percentage points among black voters. …

“Some of the most delegate-rich districts in Southern states like Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina have large shares of black Democratic voters. (Vermont is an exception; its population is largely white, but it has only one district with 11 Democratic delegates.) Under party rules, more delegates are awarded in districts with high concentrations of Democrats. Because black people overwhelmingly vote Democratic, areas with many black residents tend to have higher numbers of Democratic delegates. This is a big reason why black Democrats are so sought-after in the race for the party’s nomination. Historically, black Democratic primary voters have tended to back a single candidate, helping thrust the voting bloc to the forefront in Southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. If a single candidate can get huge vote margins with black Democrats, like Barack Obama did in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did in 2016, he or she can amass a big delegate lead over other candidates.”

-- In a wide-raging interview aboard the “No Malarkey” bus, the former vice president said he doesn’t need Obama’s endorsement, scoffed at the idea that Elizabeth Warren is building enthusiasm and accused Pete Buttigieg of stealing his plans. From Politico: “Biden reiterated that he asked Obama not to endorse him, and he stuck by that stance even when asked whether he’d want Obama’s backing if the field narrowed to three people. ‘No, because everyone knows I’m close with him,’ Biden said. ‘I don’t need an Obama endorsement.’ … Biden was asked about a POLITICO Magazine article that recently reported how Obama had confided in another candidate that his former vice president ‘really doesn’t have it’ when it comes to an intimate connection with voters. ‘He may have said that. And if it’s true, and he said it, there’s truth to it,’ Biden acknowledged on Monday before saying that he has ‘mostly campaigned for other people in the time I’ve been here. And I’ve never been in a position seeking the nomination where I have had the money and the organization to be able to get open headquarters all over the state.’ …

“Biden lamented media coverage that he said initially dismissed the durability of his candidacy because he was too moderate and didn‘t embrace policies like Medicare for All. Biden said the field was now moving closer to his views and away from the left. When asked whether he unintentionally set the stage for Buttigieg, who is leading in the polls in Iowa, Biden grew animated. ‘Set it up? He stole it! Set it up?’ Biden said of the mayor of South Bend, Ind. … The former vice president then accused the media of going too easy on Buttigieg, saying his opponent had once supported a more liberal health care plan but then pivoted … When asked about another polling leader in Iowa and elsewhere — Warren — Biden dismissed her rise and the notion that she had momentum behind her. ‘Look at the polling everywhere. Tell me. Tell me where the polling has manifested itself,’ he said. ‘She lives in Massachusetts, she’s invested millions and millions of dollars in New Hampshire, why shouldn’t she be known there?’”

-- Three state lawmakers acknowledge that lobbyists helped craft their op-eds attacking Medicare-for-all. Jeff Stein reports: “Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms. Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman (R) confirmed in a brief interview that the lawmaker’s op-ed criticizing Medicare-for-all was written with the help of Kathleen DeLand, an Ohio-based lobbyist. None of the lawmakers’ columns discloses that they were written with the help of a lobbyist.”

-- The Trump campaign denied credentials to journalists from Bloomberg News, accusing the organization of “bias” against the president. Kayla Epstein and Derek Hawkins report: “Bloomberg News faced a journalistic quandary when its owner, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, decided to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary last month. In a widely criticized decision, editor in chief John Micklethwait announced that the newsroom would continue its tradition of not investigating Bloomberg’s personal life and finances, and would extend the same policy to his Democratic opponents. The move was intended to avoid conflict of interest in the Democratic primary. Micklethwait noted, however, that Bloomberg News would continue to investigate the Trump administration. After the Trump campaign announced its decision Monday to bar Bloomberg News, President Trump took to Twitter to attack the news outlet and the New York Times for their coverage of him.”

-- The New York Times is overhauling its traditional closed-door endorsement process for Democratic presidential candidates and will instead conduct interviews with the contenders on the record and air parts of the discussions – along with the editorial board’s final decision – on its show “The Weekly.” (Politico)

-- A month after ending his presidential campaign, Beto O’Rourke is setting his focus on flipping the Texas state house. From the Houston Chronicle: “With Texas Democrats nine seats away from retaking the majority of seats in the Texas House, O’Rourke is trying to convince his donor base to send money to an organization called Flip The Texas House, which has targeted 17 House Districts in which Republican candidates won by fewer than 10 percentage points last year. More than half are districts in which O’Rourke won the majority of votes as he ran for U.S. Senate.”

-- With just a week remaining before the deadline to run for office in Texas next year, some of O’Rourke’s supporters are still hoping to see him jump into the race to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R). They even commissioned a poll that shows he’d sail through the Senate primary were he to join the race. From the Dallas Morning News: “The poll also shows him in a near-tie, trailing Cornyn 46-42 at this point, which is far stronger than others already seeking the nomination. O’Rourke’s campaign operation has gone dormant. He didn’t respond to messages on Monday and hasn’t said lately whether he’s interested. … During his presidential campaign, O’Rourke said flatly and repeatedly that he would not even consider running for the Senate in 2020 … ‘I know it’s a bit of a longshot to try and convince Beto to do this, but it is clear to a lot of people in Texas that that would be the best thing for us,’ said Alan Metni, executive director of the Democratic Policy Institute, the group that commissioned the new poll.""

-- Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp isn’t expected to nominate Rep. Douglas Collins, Trump’s pick, for a soon-to-be-open Senate seat. He’s now facing heavy backlash – including threats of a primary challenge. Seung Min Kim reports: “Kemp is expected to tap business executive Kelly Loeffler for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) … The public outcry against Kemp and Loeffler from Trump allies has led some of them to threaten a primary challenge against the first-term governor, and they have urged the president’s supporters to flood Kemp’s office with calls pushing him not to select Loeffler. … Conservative radio host Mark Levin derided Kemp as ‘another Romney,’ referring to the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and current senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, as he accused the Georgia governor of being on the precipice of appointing a ‘RINO,’ a Republican in name only … The formal announcement from Kemp is expected on Wednesday, the officials said, so as to not interfere with Isakson’s farewell address on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon.”

-- In a big break for Republican hopes of holding the Senate, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) no longer faces a primary challenge in his reelection bid. From the News & Observer: “Raleigh retired businessman Garland Tucker is ending his campaign for the Republican nomination in the U.S. Senate … Tucker invested more than $1.5 million of his own money to challenge Tillis, who is seeking a second term in 2020. Monday marked the beginning of the 2020 filing period in North Carolina. Tucker, who joined the race in May, opted not to file. … The letter cited the attention on the ongoing impeachment inquiry into [Trump] as well as Tillis’ role as one of his defenders in the Senate as a reason for Tucker’s decision to end his campaign.”

-- An outspoken Holocaust denier, activist anti-Semite and white supremacist filed again for a Chicago-area House seat. From the Chicago Sun-Times: “Arthur Jones, of suburban Lyons, won the GOP nomination in 2018 because he was the only Republican on the 3rd District primary ballot. In the general election, he was easily beaten by Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., but received about 26 percent of the vote even after his views were exposed.”

He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures.

Biden “is committed to being transparent with the American people about the smart and effective ways he’d pay for the bold changes he’s proposing,” said Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director.

AD

AD

The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.

The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s.

Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.

AD

Biden also opts not to adopt more-aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign, including a new tax on Wall Street transactions.

AD

Similarly, Biden proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent, where it was before the 2017 GOP tax law. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.

“[Biden] continues to carve out for himself an agenda that’s in the single-digit trillions rather than the double-digit trillions,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served as an adviser to Biden when he was vice president, who added the plan was still highly progressive. “That’s designed to appeal to the moderate part of the electorate, and so far that’s worked.”

AD

Biden’s plan is also likely to meet resistance from conservatives for dramatically raising taxes on firms through a number of measures — many of which were also pushed by President Barack Obama.

AD

Even though Biden’s proposal is starkly different than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary, it would further set him apart from the approach President Trump has promised to pursue. Trump has called for following up the $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017 with a new round of tax cuts, which advisers want to market as a boost for the middle class.

Biden’s plan would seek to prevent corporations from taking advantage of the tax code in a way that allows them to avoid paying many taxes. It would set a global minimum tax for companies based in the United States to recapture revenue if they book their profits in low-tax jurisdictions such as Bermuda or Ireland.

AD

It would also cap how much firms can claim in deductions, end loopholes for real estate investors in the tax code and impose sanctions on countries that allow illegal corporate tax avoidance. Biden had backed many of these ideas before this week but not in as much detail as the newly released plan.

AD

While more acceptable to Republicans than the ideas of Sanders and Warren, Biden’s plan would still make the United States the most heavily taxed country for firms in the OECD, when state and local taxes are taken into account, said Brian Riedl, a tax expert at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

Biden’s math is made easier by pitching less dramatic federal programs than his opponents. Sanders and Warren have called for more than $20 trillion of new spending on a Medicare-for-all health-care system that would guarantee free coverage to all Americans.

AD

Biden’s health-care plan, which the campaign says will cost less than $1 trillion, would leave 10 million people without insurance and do far less to rein in high deductibles and premiums faced by millions of Americans.

Sanders has pushed a plan to tackle climate change that would cost $16 trillion, calling for $2 trillion alone as part of a “Green New Deal” on funding to weatherize and retrofit homes and businesses. Biden’s climate change and infrastructure proposal would cost about $1.7 trillion in total.

Biden’s tax plan also says it will raise $750 billion for his higher-education plan, which includes debt-free community college. Warren and Sanders have proposed trillions in new education spending, as well as the elimination or vast reduction of student debt.

“Biden continues to plan the least ambitious federal program of the top-tier candidates,” said Robert C. Hockett, a professor at Cornell University who has provided policy input for Warren and Sanders. “It’s kind of a drop in the bucket given the long-term problems in the economy. It’s small potatoes for a federal plan.”

It’s interesting to recall that just over two months ago there was speculation that Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign might be finished. After the natural initial fears faded, nobody really thought his heart attack would keep him from staying in the race. But the general feeling outside his own camp was that it was a potential coup de grace for an already-struggling campaign that had lost a lot of its mojo to the high-flying Elizabeth Warren.

Instead, Sanders has hung in there and improved his relative position even as Warren has lost altitude. And as pundits have come back around to examining his base of support, many have come to realize something about it that is somewhat different and quite important, as Ron Brownstein reports:

[T]here are signs Hispanics may prove a kind of secret weapon for Sanders. In a recent Fox News poll of Nevada, Hispanics there preferred Sanders over Biden by 7 percentage points. Sanders also led Biden with them by 9 points in a recent Latino Decisions poll of California and doubled the former vice president’s vote among them in the University of Texas at Tyler poll. Sanders narrowly led Biden with Hispanics in a New York Times/Siena poll of Florida, and the two ran even in Arizona, according to the OH Predictive Insights survey.

The evidence of Sanders’s strength among Latinos is everywhere, most recently in a University of California IGS survey of the Golden State, where Sanders led the field, in no small part because of his 32 percent showing (Biden is second at 19 percent) among Latinos.

Brownstein notes that Sanders did well among younger Latinos in 2016, but quotes his pollster to the effect that Bernie is now exhibiting “more appeal across generations” in this demographic group. Perhaps — though cross tabs from Morning Consult’s most recent tracking poll show Sanders leading Biden 40/16 (with Warren at 11) among under-35 Latinos and 24/18 (with Warren at 16) among Latinos aged 34–44. But among Latinos aged 45–65, Biden leads Sanders 35/16 (Warren is at 12) and among Latino seniors Biden’s lead balloons to 45/10 (with Warren at 9). Sanders has an overall 29/23 lead over Biden (with Warren at 12) in this demographic because Latinos are an unusually young ethnic group.

The age factor is also critical to Sanders’s solid if less-powerful positioning among African-American voters, too. According to Morning Consult, Bernie is leading Joe Biden among under-30 black voters by a 41/23 margin. But at the other end of the age spectrum, among black seniors, Biden trounces Sanders 61/6.

As I noted recently, Sanders and Biden have joined Andrew Yang and Julian Castro as the remaining candidates who are drawing more support from nonwhite than white voters (by contrast, according to CNN data, Warren’s white/nonwhite percentages are at 17/9, and Pete Buttigieg’s are at 17/4). As the nomination contest calendar moves to more diverse states after New Hampshire, this dimension of their electoral bases could help them rebound from losses to Warren and/or Buttigieg in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire."

With the deadline to qualify days away, four white men and two white women have qualified so far, including former vice president Joe Biden, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, billionaire Tom Steyer, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are both nonwhite candidates, each need one more good poll to qualify, whereas Booker, who is black, and former housing secretary Julián Castro haven’t hit 4 percent in any of the required polls. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black, entered the race Nov. 14 and also does not have any qualifying polls.

For many critics, the question was how this historically diverse class of candidates has faded to white — at least on the national debate stage — before February’s Iowa caucuses. To Booker, part of the problem is that this cycle’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying rules are “preferencing millionaires and billionaires.” To Castro, the news media’s narrative on “electability” has also played a role — an issue he cited in part for both Harris’s downfall and the difficulties facing nonwhite candidates vying for a spot on the debate stage.

Harris had qualified for the debate but cited a lack of funds as the main reason for her decision to bow out. In recent weeks, several news stories described internal turmoil and tense disagreements among staffers in her campaign.

Castro pointed to stories in the New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, all of which questioned the health of Harris’s presidential bid after losing its early momentum and running into management issues. But in a videotaped interview posted to Twitter on Tuesday night, Castro argued that the media’s treatment of Harris had been “grossly unfair and unfortunate” and that Harris was held “to a different standard, a higher standard.”

Speaking more generally, he added on Twitter later: “The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” he said. “Our party’s diversity is our strength, and it’s a shame that we’re headed for a December debate without a single person of color.”

Castro’s criticism stems from debate within the Democratic Party about which candidate is most equipped to corral support from a multiracial coalition of voters, as President Barack Obama did, while having the best chance at defeating President Trump. As The Post’s Philip Bump reported in a Tuesday analysis, 77 percent of black voters viewed Biden, Warren or Sanders as the most capable of beating Trump, according to a November Post-ABC News poll.

In a fundraising video Tuesday, Castro said he was still a few thousand donors away from meeting the DNC’s donor requirements for qualifying for the debate. The rules also require candidates to score in four approved polls over 4 percent, or two early-state polls over 6 percent, and to have 200,000 unique donors plus a minimum of 800 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins, who also previously worked on former Democratic congressman John Delaney’s presidential campaign, told Fox News that he believed the DNC’s rules “ended up hurting” the campaigns of candidates like Castro, Harris and Booker because campaigns must spend “insane amounts” of money on donor lists to meet the requirement. He worried that not having a person of color onstage would affect turnout, particularly among African American voters.

Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that advocates for electing women of color, said she worried about whether the candidates on the debate stage would resonate with black female voters. “It’s a sad state of affairs to have six white candidates onstage, many of whom don’t necessarily speak with black women — who are the powerhouse voters,” she told MSNBC on Tuesday.

Like Booker, Castro, in his fundraising video, also criticized wealthier candidates who “basically buy their way onto this debate stage.” In a fundraising email of her own, Warren attacked billionaires Steyer and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, another recent addition to the Democratic race, while lamenting Harris’s departure.

“Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand — two women senators who, together, won more than 11.5 million votes in their last elections — have been forced out of this race, while billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg have been allowed to buy their way in,” Warren wrote. “Running for president shouldn’t be a passion project for bored billionaires.""

But some Republicans mocked Democrats’ concern that the field of candidates on the debate stage may be all white. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) made a quip on Twitter that critics called racist. Linking to a tweet listing the all-white lineup for the debate, Cheney wrote: “You forgot Pocahontas.” Using a favorite Trump nickname, Cheney was referring to Warren, who apologized earlier this year for identifying as Native American during her law career. (A spokesman for Cheney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment in response to the backlash.)

Others pointed out that Harris’s campaign faltered because of other problems, such as her record as a prosecutor. On Tuesday, Harris said she was “still very much in this fight.”

When Trump said he would “miss” her in an apparently facetious tweet, Harris responded: “Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial.”

In the fond hopes of those who consider some sort of single-payer health-care system essential, 2020 once looked like the year that would give their movement a giant leap forward. Initially no fewer than 13 Democratic presidential candidates (Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Bill de Blasio, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Tim Ryan, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Eric Swalwell, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) said they favored some sort of single-payer plan. Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, and Warren were original cosponsors of Bernie Sanders’s signature Medicare for All bill, an uncompromising version of single-payer, while Gabbard, Ryan, and Swalwell had co-sponsored the House counterpart bill.

But as the invisible primary segment of the 2020 cycle proceeded with its debates and fast-changing rivalries, support for Sanders-style M4A splintered, and public support for it declined significantly, too. The latter erosion of once-robust majorities favoring Sanders’s approach was likely attributable to a combination of relentless attacks from the health-care industry, and to a growing public understanding that “Medicare for All” really meant single-payer health-care, with no room for the private insurance policies that, after all, about 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had chosen through the Medicare Advantage option.

Partly thanks to debate moderator interest in sowing conflict among the Democratic candidates, hair-splitting over the details of various Medicare for All and then Medicare for Most proposals became and remained a prominent part of intraparty conflict. And before long, supporters of progressive candidates were using the health-care postures of their opponents to paint them as corporate sell-outs, while supporters of moderate candidates scored M4A as a general election loser. Far from ushering in a consensus for a big leap toward universal health coverage, the M4A debate has unsettled the Democratic Party on the one issue they think they “own” against Republicans. At least one major candidate, Kamala Harris, arguably ran a promising campaign right into the ground via feckless efforts to take and explain a more nuanced position.

As Vox’s Ezra Klein explains, M4A has become almost entirely a symbolic issue:

In Democratic Party politics, Medicare has become a which-side-are-you-on test. Are you with Sanders and the left, and against insurance companies, squishy moderates, commodified health care, and a politics of preemptive compromise? Or are you afraid that Sanders and the left are going to scare the country into reelecting Donald Trump and set health care reform back for a generation?

This is a fundamentally political question, and splitting the difference through complex acts of technocracy ends up alienating both sides.

That was definitely true of Kamala Harris’s proposal, and Elizabeth Warren’s transition plan to M4A was quickly attacked by hardcore single-payer fans as a sell-out. But as Klein notes, there’s an air of unreality about all these arguments, because M4A simply isn’t happening in the near-term:

The ferocity of this debate is at odds with the legislative reality. Even if a Democrat wins, Medicare-for-all will not pass the House and it will not pass the Senate. “I’m not a big fan of Medicare for All,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. When I interviewed the key Senate Democrats who will write the next health reform bill, none of them supported Medicare-for-all or believed it could pass.

So are Democrats doomed to fight each other over M4A right up to and beyond the 2020 elections, feeding Republican attack lines on them as both feckless and socialistic?

Klein suggests a sort of Nixon-to-China solution: Anoint Sanders the nominee (or at least the chief Democratic spokesman on health-care, I suppose) as the one candidate with the progressive street cred to gently explain to single-payer advocates that compromise will be necessary:

Sanders also has a unique level of credibility with the party’s more ideological left wing. His commitment to Medicare-for-all is sufficiently steadfast that leftists will believe him if and when he has to convince them that the compromised bill Congress is prepared to pass is the best bill they’re going to get. He wrote the damn bill; he might be the only one who can cut the damn deal. And if Sanders was able to get an ambitious Medicare-for-more plan through Congress and make it look like a compromise, it’d be a tremendous legislative coup.

This does make some sense, because Sanders either has — or will have to — develop a Plan B when the pixie-dust “political revolution” he has claimed will suddenly sweep Congress toward M4A fails to materialize. But in the mean time, of course, making M4A official party gospel will expose the party to a multi-billion-dollar “no socialized medicine” campaign during the general election.

Perhaps it would be best for Democrats to muddle through the primaries while trying to keep differences on health-care policy from appearing as vast as the gulf between virtually all Democrats and virtually all Republicans. But if they do win, whether he’s president of the United States or simply a very distinguished U.S. senator, Bernie Sanders may still be called to the patriotic duty of explaining that the “political revolution” has its limits."

Kamala Harris has dropped out. Cory Booker hasn’t qualified for December’s debate. Julián Castro missed November’s and is polling between zero and one percent nationally. At various points, all three were considered heirs apparent to the voting bloc that lifted Barack Obama to victory. And all three are strong arguments for why the vaunted “Obama coalition” might’ve been the ex-president’s alone.

Conventional wisdom has long held that re-creating Obama’s path to the White House hinged on building a base out of Northern whites, young people, and energized black and Latino voters. The last debate saw Harris and Booker each cast themselves as the candidate best equipped to accomplish this. “We’ve got to re-create the Obama coalition to win,” Harris said. “[Nobody] on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters,” said Booker. Neither has built a convincing case for themselves. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has consistently led polls of Democratic primary voters, including black and Latino ones, and most maneuvering from his nonwhite challengers has been aimed at undermining his dominance. A senescent white centrist might seem an unlikely inheritor of Obama’s supporters, but Biden is well on his way. “I’m part of that Obama coalition,” the 77-year-old said at the debate. “I have more people supporting me, in the black community, that have announced for me, because they know me. They know who I am.”

Almost every political figure upon whom pols and pundits have bestowed the “next Obama” moniker has traits in common: They’re invariably young, almost always nonwhite (Beto O’Rourke, who earned early plaudits from the ex-president, was a rare exception), and have an inspiring but necessarily vague message aimed at flattering their countrymen’s better angels. They embody the shifting demographics that strategists believe will define the electorate of the future: nonwhite with fluency navigating a multiracial milieu without making its occupants feel at odds. But Trump’s election has altered this calculus. White voters who dabbled in multiracial democracy during the Obama years have proven equally enticed by a white supremacist. In 2020, voters repulsed by Trump are less interested in making history and electing some nebulous candidate for America’s diverse future. They want to beat Trump. And most seem to have decided that a challenger whose case for electability is a superficial resemblance to Obama isn’t their best bet.

This isn’t to say that Harris, Booker, and Castro don’t have qualities that recommend them. Castro in particular has distinguished himself with his thoughtful platform aimed at poor people, undocumented immigrants, and the criminalized and incarcerated; Booker has the Trump era’s signature piece of bipartisan legislation under his belt with the First Step Act; and Harris has shined during adversarial exchanges with Republicans in Senate hearings. But it stands to reason that a person seeking to recapture the so-called Obama coalition should bear more than a passing resemblance to the man himself. And none come close: The ex-president’s mix of charisma, rhetorical skill, political savvy, and intelligence remain unparalleled in today’s Democratic Party, and make him a singular figure in modern politics regardless of racial background. His success was also specific to its time. Much of the American public had soured on George W. Bush’s leadership and warmongering by 2008, and Obama not only represented the most striking contrast, he was one of the few senators in the race who hadn’t voted for the Iraq War. (He was not yet in the Senate at the time, but spoke out against the war beforehand.) This gave him an air of legitimacy with progressive voters that Booker and Harris — with their evangelism for charter schools and work as a prosecutor, respectively — are missing. Both were left with a narrow path to the nomination: Either convince black voters and white moderates that they were surer bets than Biden in the general election, or prove to progressives that their bona fides belied a pragmatism and diverse appeal that made them viable alternatives to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

None of it has worked. Their presumed constituencies have found their preferred candidates elsewhere. Older black voters have gravitated to Biden, with his political longevity and vows to preserve Obama’s legislative legacy, while younger black voters have been drawn to the structural change and revolutionary fervor peddled by Warren and Sanders, respectively. Hampering Booker, Harris, and Castro’s cases further was a lack of clarity regarding why an electorate that just backed Trump would suddenly be enticed by a less-galvanizing echo of his predecessor, the black president whose legacy Trump vowed to negate. Voters in 2020 won’t have suddenly lost their susceptibility to the president’s racist charms. And few on the Democratic side are willing to submit a candidate whose appeal to white people with questionable racial politics is dubious or unproven.

Given the Democratic electorate’s consuming desire to oust Trump, it’s unclear if Obama himself could’ve made it out of the 2020 primary. The eventual president trailed Hillary Clinton among even black voters in 2008 until he proved he could win overwhelmingly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prospect of continued Republican governance is threat enough today that risk aversion is at a premium. Many voters — and black voters in particular — agree that it’s no time to roll the dice on an unknown quantity, as Obama would’ve been considered. This is by no means a universal consensus. The success of Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns suggest an appetite for democratic socialism that would upend the status quo. Pete Buttigieg is overperforming as a small-city mayor. Andrew Yang has built a coalition that, while almost negligibly small, has generated consistently higher polling numbers than either Booker or Castro.

But generally speaking, the assumption that nonwhite candidates would be best positioned to rebuild Obama’s coalition by virtue of their shared nonwhiteness and a handful of other superficial parallels hasn’t borne out. Democrats instead have thus far coalesced behind a white septuagenarian who fought against busing, implied that every black candidate before Obama was “unclean,” and had at least one other presidential campaign end ignominiously. They’ve done so largely because Biden is well-known and well-liked, has personal ties to the white Rust Belt voters who helped deliver Trump’s win in 2016, and boasts goodwill among liberal voters generated by his affiliation with Obama, who was extremely popular. Simply put, they think he’s the guy that the widest range of voters can agree on. And if this is the conclusion they’ve drawn a mere three years after Obama exited the White House, it’s worth asking whether his coalition, activated by a candidate with a profile similar to his own, was more fluky confluence of circumstances than replicable political strategy.

This article has been updated to more accurately reflect Obama’s activity around the Iraq War."

Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have spent the last several months attempting to wriggle free of a trap they set for themselves two and a half years ago, when the leading contenders jumped aboard Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan. Politico has a story detailing how this bizarre debacle came out.

Before 2017, the dominant view within the Democratic Party held that single-payer insurance is a theoretically superior policy design that is impossible to obtain, at least in the short run. The unfortunate reason for this is the path dependency created by the peculiar American system, which, beginning in World War II, built a system in which employers provided insurance to most working adults. Generations of Democratic presidents — Truman, Johnson, Clinton — tried and failed to steer the system off the course. But the high cost of the system paradoxically made it harder to dislodge, as it created more constituencies with an interest in maintaining the status quo (insurers, doctors, hospitals, drugmakers) and made people who had employer-sponsored insurance ever more skittish about losing their benefits.

President Obama’s solution was to leave the employer system in place and build around it to cover the people outside the system: Medicaid expansion would cover those with the lowest incomes, and a regulated and subsidized market would offer insurance to those in the middle class who were locked out of the employer system. Obama’s reforms worked — imperfectly, like any social reform in history, but unambiguously. Obamacare’s remaining holes — excessive premium costs for high-income customers, and the refusal by some red states to join Medicaid expansion — could be patched up at relatively little cost.

What would be extraordinarily difficult would be moving the 150 million Americans already covered by employer insurance onto a public plan. It would require, first, transferring the cost of their insurance off the books of their employers, which is largely invisible, and onto the federal budget, requiring major tax hikes, It would also require persuading them that they’d be better off with a public insurance plan than their current coverage. I believe they would, but closing that sale to an electorate that is averse to change and suspicious of politicians is an extraordinary hurdle. It seemed crazy to multiply the fiscal cost and political risk of the Democrats’ health-care position merely to change the coverage of Americans who already had insurance.

Yet somehow, in the summer of 2017, almost all the Democratic presidential candidates decided to do just that.

At the time, the left had gained the appearance of an ascent that far outstripped its actual power. The aftermath of the 2016 election had persuaded progressive activists that Bernie Sanders was the party’s future, and had lost either due to cheating (as hard-core supporters maintained) or Hillary Clinton’s name recognition and establishment support. The future belonged to Bernie, or at least his ideas. The debate was taking place largely within Twitter, which magnified the views of progressive activists and intellectuals and underrepresented those of both the party’s voters and elected officials.

Politico’s reporting fills in some of the details that explain the foolhardy rush to endorse the Sanders bill, which proposed to fold the entire health-care system into Medicare, without explaining any of the tradeoffs that had made such an undertaking impossible. Two unnamed policy aides say they knew at the time the bill was not a finished product. But Kamala Harris leaped aboard, moving so quickly she joked at the time of her announcement that her own staff would be learning of her stance in real time.

At this point, the fear of being outflanked and holding an apparently unpopular “no we can’t” position took hold. “Kamala’s decision started a stampede,” one campaign operative tells Politico. “Some of them were checking the box of doing what they felt they needed to in order to appease the progressives,” another campaign adviser admits.

It took two years for the candidates to grasp the liability they had taken on. Progressive activists circulated polls showing “Medicare for All” drew broad public support, but that support rested on the absence of details. Once voters were told the policy involved higher taxes or moving everybody off employer-sponsored insurance, the bottom fell out. The strategy of attacking anybody who pointed this out as an industry shill was only going to work for so long.

At this point, the main distinction between the rivals to Sanders is the speed and distance with which they’ve raced away from his bill. Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg almost immediately declared their support to be aspirational and symbolic. Harris oscillated disastrously between renewing her support and disavowing the bill (which is itself rather galling, given the the role she played in stampeding her colleagues toward it in the first place). Elizabeth Warren grasped tightly to the bill over the summer, then rolled out an elaborate series of pay-fors, and only now is endorsing an interim plan that she promises to undertake first, before getting to Medicare for All by the end of her term. (In reality, she is signaling that later means never, but the question is whether that will allow her to disavow the attacks on the bill if she wins the nomination.) Ed Kilgore’s case that Bernie himself will need to bail the Democrats out of the jam created by their support for his bill is an indication of just how dire the situation has grown.

Progressive activists are not the only source of bad political ideas. Moderates have bad ideas, too. Yet what is so striking about the Medicare for All debacle is how foreseeable it was, and how so many candidates plunged ahead simply because all the other candidates were doing it, too."

Not long before his assassination, Martin Luther King Jr. announced the formation of the Poor People’s Campaign. The project would eventually unite poor whites from Appalachia with farmworkers, indigenous people, and black civil-rights activists. After King’s death in 1968, the campaign marshaled a significant mobilization in Washington, D.C., and then went quiet — until 2017. Revived by Reverend William Barber and Reverend Liz Theoharis, the renewed Poor People’s Campaign continues the mission set out by King and his allies so many decades ago. Its ambitions are broad: On its website, it says it intends to “lift up and deepen the leadership of those most affected by systemic racism, poverty, the war economy, and ecological devastation.” It goes on to state, bluntly, that “people should not live in or die from poverty in the richest nation ever to exist.”

Since its revival, the multiracial, interfaith campaign organized six weeks of civil disobedience last year in addition to bus tours of impoverished communities. Earlier this year, the campaign also hosted several Democratic candidates for president, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, at a forum so they could answer questions from activists. (Another candidate, Pete Buttigieg, spoke at Barber’s Goldsboro, North Carolina, church in recent days.) In June 2020, the campaign intends to organize a march in Washington, D.C., to coincide with its first ever Poor People’s Assembly, which will train the nation’s attention on poverty and related issues ahead of the presidential election. That work serves the campaign’s principal goals: to force a more honest conversation about the state of inequality in America, and to make sure that conversation leads to substantive political change.

The new Poor People’s Campaign builds in part on the Moral Mondays movement, which began in 2013 as a series of demonstrations against the policies of North Carolina’s then-governor, Pat McCrory. Barber, known to many as one of the lead organizers of the Moral Mondays protests, spoke to Intelligencer two weeks ago about the Poor People’s Campaign, the upcoming election, and the obstacles in the way of a more equitable American future.

This interview has been edited for clarity and condensed for length.

Polling suggests that Americans tend to think of themselves as middle class, even if their household incomes are low. But historically, the Poor People’s Campaign has fractured that myth by emphasizing poverty. Why is it so important for struggling people to understand themselves as poor or working class?

﻿This campaign is being built from the bottom up. It is poor people, impacted people saying it’s time for us to unite together and transform the reality that they do not have to be. And they were the ones that told us we need to make this clear: that in this nation, a nation that gives trillions of dollars of tax cuts to benefit 75,000 or 100,000 people, there are also 140 million poor and low-wealth people. Some of them are three- or four-hundred dollars from pure economic destruction. Many of them are also living on the street.

One of the problems with the polling is that the polling operates in a narrative that oftentimes uses the government numbers for poverty and not the actual number for poverty that we use in our empirical data study called “The Souls of Poor Folk.” Also, over the years, poverty has been racialized so badly that some people tend to resist the category of poverty.

But a lot of the polls, they haven’t been the places we go, in the hills of Kentucky where people are very clear that they are poor and low-wealth. Or in the Delta of Mississippi. And they are not ashamed of being poor. They are ashamed of a country that continues to push policies that create poverty. Poverty is not, for them, something that they have created because of their lack of initiative. You know, we talk about the working poor, as if the rest of poor folk aren’t doing anything. The problem is not a lack of morality, it is a fractured and broken system that tends to lean itself toward the middle-class and the wealthy. When we even have political discussions, since 1968 and 1969, we have had the Republicans racializing poverty and Democrats running from poverty. Even the word “poverty” has almost been removed from the political discourse. In 2016, there were 26 presidential debates. Not one was about poverty.

Trump is very good, obviously, at pitting people against each other in a way that is heavily racialized. But the Poor People’s Campaign is a multiracial coalition. That really presents another way of being, doesn’t it?

﻿It really does. To understand Trump you almost have to step away from him and understand the Southern Strategy that began in 1968 as the attacks on the war against poverty were beginning to work and King had been killed. What you have is an assassination of a movement. You also have at that time Strom Thurmond, Lee Atwater, and other people distinctly decide that we’re going to push racial division, and we’re going to use three or four tactics. Number one, we’re not going to use the very inflammatory words, politically. We’re not going to use the N-word. We’re going to talk about things like tax cuts and forced busing as a states’ rights issue, and the danger of entitlement. And we’ve got to create a narrative that basically blames poor people, especially black and brown poor people, for everybody else’s problems.

They called it positive polarization and they knew it could drive a wedge. Dr. King said in 1965 on the steps of an Alabama courthouse that this tactic had been used all the way back in the 1800s, that every time black and white poor people had the potential to create a political base that could transform the country, the racist aristocracy would always sow division. So the segregation of society was created as a way to undermine a power that could reset economic justice in this country. I like to give that history because Trump is the recipient of years and years of this kind of division.

I want to talk about religion for a second. The Christian right is in power right now, and for decades, they’ve heavily influenced the way we talk about values and morality. What does the religious left have to offer here?

﻿So first of all, the practice of religion used in the service of oppression, injustice, racism, and economic denial is as old as the country. It’s not new, it’s slaveholder religion.

I can say that I’m a theologically conservative liberal, Evangelical Pentecostal Biblicist. Basically, I’m a Christian. But what does it mean to be a left Christian, or a right Christian? It’s not like both have equal moral standing. It’s not conservative versus liberal. It’s right versus wrong.

It is indisputable that in the Christian and Hebrew Bible, there are more than 2,500 scriptures that talk about the responsibility of people of faith to challenge the nations, to deal with the issue of poverty, the sick, the children, protect the women and to welcome the immigrant. Indisputable. As a Christian, it is indisputable that Jesus began his ministry with good news to the poor.

Part of what we are doing in this movement with people of faith from every different direction is saying, we’re no longer going to sit back and allow Christian nationalism, so-called white Evangelicalism, to dominate. To suggest that if you’re against abortion, you’re against women’s right to choose, you’re for guns, for prayer in schools, for tax cuts, a Republican, then you have taken the moral position, that is modern-day heresy. And we have to challenge it. But we’re not just going to challenge it just emotionally. We’re saying if you want to have a discussion about morality from a Biblical standpoint, then let’s have a real one.

What do you think poor people need that they aren’t currently getting from their elected representatives in either party?

One thing is, in this country, if you’re not in the narrative, you’re not going to be in the policy. So we’ve said to each presidential candidate, will you commit to demanding that we have full, open debates to talk about the need to address the moral crisis and the economic crisis of poverty and the injustices that interlock with it?

We have to change our whole narrative. Seven people die from vaping, and it’s a national emergency. Columbia University says 200,000 people die each year from poverty and it’s not a national emergency? One person is shot by a racist cop and we get in the street and we should, but almost 5,000 people die for every 1 million people that do not have health care, according to a study at Harvard, and there’s no outrage. That has to change.

Poor and low-wealth people are seeing the need to galvanize themselves around an agenda, not a party, not a person, but an agenda. They are that sleeping giant, if you will, the power base that could reset American politics right now. Forty-three percent of this nation is not being discussed or talked about. For instance, if you run the table in the south from Virginia to Texas, you end up with about 168, 170 electoral votes. Thirteen states. And yet all 13 are high-poverty states. Denial of health-care states, voter-suppression states. What happens if a movement is able to help people see how they’re being played against each other? You could reset the entire political calculus. And that’s where I think that party politics has missed it, with this constant conversation about the middle-class and welfare and writing off 140 million low-income and low-wealth people. Forty-three percent of this nation is not being discussed or talked about.

Why do you think that parties are writing off poor and low-wealth people?

﻿Republicans tend to racialize it. It plays into their racial narrative. They flip back, and say to poor whites, “You’re poor because we’re over here trying to help these people.” That’s the philosophy around so-called entitlements and why they need to be reformed or stopped, because it was breaking the nation and holding it back: All these poor people over here, i.e. black and brown people, i.e. people who are lazy, it’s their fault. That disables a real conversation about poverty.

And then on the Democratic side, somebody has spooked them. I don’t know what in the world has happened. I don’t understand how you come from the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson and now you’re scared of addressing the issue of poverty. Their consultants or whoever has told them, “Don’t say the word poverty.” And so they come up with all of these, I won’t call them innuendos, but all of these ways of trying to say “poverty” without actually saying the word. They talk about “the working poor.” Or people “struggling to afford the American dream.” People who are “trying to get up.” No, some folk are just poor!

Do you think there’s a lack of a sense of urgency?

﻿Yes. It could be fixed quickly. There are things we could do. Marian Wright Edelman said we could take 2 percent of the federal budget and put it toward programs that we know work, and eradicate 60 percent of child poverty. We could raise the minimum wage to $15 immediately, and bam, 30 million people would be raised up to a living wage.

Elizabeth Warren, I thank God for her, but I wish her, Bernie, any of them would have started out not with “here’s my plan to fix it and how much it will cost.” Flip the question. What will it cost us not to fix it?

How have movements like Fight for 15 and Red for Ed, the teachers strike movement, helped drive this point home, that we ought to discuss poverty more openly?

﻿Yeah. In fact, the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina helped to set the framework for Fight for 15. I’ve been involved with Fight for 15 from the get out, the first national speaker. But they also learned from the tactics of Moral Monday. You have to raise the issue, keep it in front of the people. So, yes, Fight for 15 and other movements are critical.

So we support and endorse many movements. We have now 15 so religious groups and denominations. We have people that are not necessarily people of faith. In addition to the three coordinated committees in 43 states and the District of Columbia, we have about 120 or so other organizations involved. And it’s not about them coming under one person’s leadership. It’s fusion organizing. This is coalition.

So it’s solidarity?

﻿Even more than solidarity. It’s the sense that I’m not gonna allow people to give me a victory here while I write you off over there. So when we go in a place like, say, eastern Kentucky in Appalachia, I don’t change what I say about race there. That’s what politicians do. I don’t do that. I say y’all, let’s do something. And we put up maps. And we say, now in West Virginia, you have voter suppression, and we put that map up. And then we say, did you also know in West Virginia you have a high level of poverty. We’ll do child poverty. Then we’ll do women in poverty, then we do the denial of health care, then we do denial of living wages, denial of union rights, denial of LGBTQ rights, denial of women’s rights. And then we step back and say, do you see the thing about this national map? The same states that do the race thing are doing this to you too.

And I had one white guy in Appalachia who stood up and said, “DAMN!” I’m not being facetious. He said, “Reverend Barber, they’ve been playing us.” And I said that’s right. We were there in Kentucky, and some people told us not to go to Harlan County. Harlan County, where Justice Harlan came from, the only Supreme Court justice that voted against Plessy v. Ferguson. Harlan County, where Lyndon B. Johnson started the War on Poverty. Democrats hadn’t been to Harlan County since I don’t know when. I mean, they just write it off. But we had 300 folk in the middle of the day turn out.

I went outside with one guy and he said, “I’m a McCoy.” I said, “What kind of McCoy?” He said again, “I’m a McCoy.” And then I said, “Yes sir, I understand.” He said, “We ready to fight.” I told him this is a nonviolent movement. He said, “I get it, but let me tell you, you’ve got a lot of friends up here.” I told him, “Wait a minute, people tell me this is Trump country. Why did folk vote for Trump?”

He said, “Look, we knew Trump was … ” and he used an expletive. He said, “Folks are hurting, and needed more attention, they want people to know.” Democrats haven’t been back here since Lyndon B. Johnson came back here. These hills are full of people who, if you came out here and talked to them and didn’t just write them off as ignorant and let them know you were serious about addressing the issue, even if you didn’t totally change the county, you could close the margins — i.e., what just happened.

Yes, that’s exactly what happened with the election of Andy Beshear.

﻿And what did the governor say that night? We never endorsed Beshear in the campaign. We endorse an agenda, we exposed the current government. [Matt] Bevin pushed back black folk from Louisville and white folk from eastern Kentucky when he wouldn’t let them come into the statehouse. And it went all over the news and people saw. We pushed an agenda that he resisted. And what did the new governor say when he accepted? He said this campaign is not about Democratic versus Republican, liberal versus conservative, right versus wrong. He actually gravitated to the language of the Poor People’s Campaign because he saw a movement — our campaign, and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth — bringing folk together. Two of the five or six counties we worked in heavily for a couple of years flipped.

It’s interesting that you say that, because we’ve heard a lot this election cycle about the notion of electability. People are afraid that certain candidates aren’t electable because they back policies like Medicare for All, or they’re talking about poverty, or they’re going after billionaire CEOs. What do you think of that conversation?

﻿I think that I’m always amazed by people who say that things are unelectable, people are unelectable. Nelson Mandela said that it’s always impossible until you do it. There’s a crowd that always says it’s impossible. Lincoln was unelectable. No one thought Franklin Roosevelt could get elected with polio. Half of all of the things we enjoy today, people a hundred years ago said was impossible. Medicaid. Living wage. The eight-hour workday.

What you have is almost a kind of lazy politics. It wants you to deny what you really believe or deny fighting for what’s right or deny the hard work of showing the American people. Now sure, if you do politics as we’ve been doing, a lot of things are impossible because there’s no real focus, no real conversation. But what if you change? What if you force the media and others into areas to see. What if America sees itself and understands how desperate things are? Do you believe that the conscience of this nation is so dim and so dark and so dull that people wouldn’t be moved? Because if that’s what you believe, then we have a problem bigger than our politics."

“What would you have done to me? Torn my ears off. Absolutely. I’d be a plagiarizing, no-good old man,” Biden told reporters, seeming to allude, in one sentence, to the plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential bid and the nagging questions this time about his age.

The “No Malarkey” tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.

“I’m going to say something that I believe to be self-serving, and maybe it is,” Biden told voters in Emmetsburg, Iowa, on Monday. “In all those states we have to win, I do pretty well. . . . So, folks, I believe I can beat Donald Trump. I believe we will beat Donald Trump. I believe Donald Trump believes I will beat Donald Trump.”

Venting his anger

But the tour has also at times served as a bit of a release valve for weeks of seemingly pent-up frustration.

After stumbling in 1988, Biden endured another failed White House bid 20 years later when his 2008 candidacy was overshadowed by the electrifying primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And now Biden has been unable to put away opponents with shorter résumés and, in his view, a lesser chance of defeating Trump.

AD

On Monday, as Biden’s caravan traveled from a stop in northern Iowa to the airport, where he was jetting off for an evening of fundraising in New York before resuming the tour, he invited a group of reporters onto the bus for an unusually expansive conversation. At times, the exchange felt more like an airing of grievances, with Biden waving off staff members who noted he was going over the 30-minute agreed-upon time limit.

AD

“Look at the polling everywhere,” he said in response to a question about Warren. “Tell me where this great enthusiasm is manifesting itself. She lives in Massachusetts. She’s advertising millions and millions in New Hampshire. Why shouldn’t she be known there?”

When it was pointed out that thousands of Warren supporters had come to see the senator recently in Chicago, he became incredulous.

AD

“Chicago. Oh, great, a great showing in Chicago. Look, guys, you always want to give me numbers but never want to apply numbers to them.”

He said the media’s bias toward Warren was evident as she shifted her stance on Medicare-for-all. Warren had embraced the single-payer plan trumpeted by Sanders. But last month, she pivoted to a more centrist idea: delaying the implementation of Medicare-for-all by three years. In the interim, health-care consumers could opt in to a government plan. But Biden said the media didn’t fully interrogate Warren about how much her initial Medicare-for-all plan would cost.

AD

“How many times did the press ask how much it will cost,” Biden said. “She never answered, because you kept talking about how she’s rising.”

The electability argument

Biden said he felt he’d been fighting against another hurdle: the perception that he was too moderate for a Democratic Party that had become more liberal following Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016.

“What happened after Hillary. [People said,] ‘Guess what, man, the party has turned so far left. So far left, man. And you just can’t win, no one can possibly win, not in that lane.’ Now, and I was the one, remember all the debates in the beginning, ‘Biden is the moderate. Biden’s not progressive enough.’ ”

But now, he noted, other candidates have embraced a more moderate view on health care — adopting what he called the “Biden plan,” preserving the Affordable Care Act and giving the public an option to join a government program.

“I said it then, I’ll say it again, Medicare-for-all ain’t going anywhere, period, because there’s a thing called truth in getting there,” Biden said.

The “No Malarkey” theme, emblazoned in big white letters spread across Biden’s blue motor coach, comes from one of Biden’s favorite expressions. It’s another way of saying “straight talk,” which became the calling card for similar bus caravans that helped define the political brand of a longtime Biden friend, the late Republican Sen. John McCain.

The tour is an attempt to form connections with a larger swath of Iowans, particularly in rural areas, Biden said. It stretches through eight days and more than 660 miles.

At times early on, Biden sounded hoarse or dabbed at his nose during a taxing long weekend of town halls and small-town pit stops. Staffers kept a glass of water tucked near any lectern where he was speaking. His speeches were short by Biden standards, around 20 minutes or so per stop, a move he said gave him ample time to talk with anyone who stayed after but also offered some respite for his vocal cords.

AD

Biden and his surrogates — he spent the first part of the tour traveling with former U.S. agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie — have argued that Biden is beating Trump head-to-head in battleground states that could decide the election. Iowa Democrats, they said, should consider those numbers when deciding which potential nominee could attract general election voters in key states.

“What about the people who aren’t as involved in politics? What about the independents? Who are they going to trust as well?” Christie Vilsack asked voters in Spencer on Sunday night. “The election is going to be won in the middle. And I want to make sure that I choose the person who’s most electable to the widest group of people.”

AD

Some voters who came to see Biden along the tour acknowledged a concern that a more liberal nominee seemed like a risky bet in the general election.

AD

“I hear a lot of people saying we need to take this . . . swat to the left, and I just don’t agree with that,” said Travis Halm, 29, of Council Bluffs, who came out to see the kickoff to Biden’s bus tour. “We can have a contest about who’s more liberal or who’s more progressive if we want, but it’s not going to do us any good if we’re sitting around sulking on November 4 after losing an election.”

Bob Seggerman, a registered Republican who voted for Trump and plans to do so again in 2020, got talked into coming to an event at a church-turned-restaurant in Spencer by some of his friends who are Democrats.

“I think [Biden has] got a softer appeal that’s more empathetic, and I like him more than the other Democrats,” he said. But, added Seggerman, who at 67 is a decade younger than Biden: “The only thing is, I look at the age of this man. A person who gets to be a certain age is ready to do just about anything but be president.”

AD

On the stump, Biden told voters that Trump’s America had failed middle-class and rural communities like the ones he was visiting on his bus tour. There were also lighter moments, like the widely mocked and memed image of Biden nibbling on his wife’s finger during her opening speech. Mostly, though, he stressed that he would bring a steady hand to the nation’s highest office and foreign policy, and that he’d put middle-class values first.

“I think we have to very deeply restore the backbone of this country, and by that I mean the middle class,” he said.

The tour underscored how Iowa remains vital to Biden’s hopes of winning the nomination. He has vowed to visit all 99 counties during the campaign, though even after the barnstorming trip, he will only have been to about a third. A weak showing in the Feb. 3 caucuses could affect his strength in two other early voting states — South Carolina, where he holds a big lead among that state’s large African American electorate, and Nevada, where he says he has strong Hispanic backing. If he survives there, another threat looms in early March, when the race turns to multiple big states in a Super Tuesday showdown where former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to make his stand.

'Still well in the game'

Biden, in his session with reporters, offered his analysis of the road ahead — all but conceding a potential Iowa defeat but insisting that he alone can rebuild the multiethnic coalition that propelled Obama.

“If I were to come in like some of the polling has shown, you know, like, five points behind, three points behind or seven points behind, I think I survive.” he said. “I think I do well, because of the depth of the support that I have in the African American [and] Latino community, and there’s not anybody so far that has risen to the point where they can all of a sudden everybody in the community can say, ‘Whoa. Wait a minute.’ Well, there is nobody else that’s in there that’s in a position to do what Barack was able to do."

When Kamala Harris announced her presidential campaign in January, Rachel Maddow told her, “I think there is a good chance that you are going to win the nomination.” Soon after, Harris’s 20,000-plus-person kickoff rally in Oakland exceeded expectations set by party chiefs who saw in her an aspirational candidate who could represent the heart of the party both ideologically and demographically. Six months later, when the California senator challenged Joe Biden onstage at the first debate in Miami — surprising everyone, and delivering the most memorable lines of the campaign — her moment seemed to arrive.

But Harris was uneasy even as she vaulted toward the field’s top tier in the ensuing days. She cringed at how the coverage was painting her as the race’s anti-Biden attack artist, not as a nimble realist able to build consensus between the party’s warring factions, as she believed herself to be. She hesitated as some advisors encouraged her to re-embrace the strategy and single out Biden again in the next debate, in Detroit. She delivered no scripted strike, and instead took a pummeling from him and others now eager to take her down a peg. “That wasn’t great,” campaign donors told her at suddenly nervy private fundraising events over the next few days. “That’s an understatement,” she responded.

Harris, however, never reversed and went after Biden. That, she told her inner circle, wasn’t her. Instead, until late this fall — just weeks before she pulled the plug on her campaign on Tuesday afternoon, after reviewing its finances and chances over the Thanksgiving weekend — Harris routinely insisted that she was still introducing herself to Americans. But Harris’s campaign, dogged for months by questions about her health-care stance, her political ideology, and, ultimately, her staff’s infighting, never seemed to settle on a single consistent answer to a question voters kept asking: What was she about? At times on the trail, she presented herself as a matter-of-fact progressive, a comforter-in-chief, and an unapologetic prosecutor. Harris, and those who’ve known her for decades, insist all of these are accurate descriptors, but that at her core she’s a results-oriented pragmatist with a long-running disdain for ideological boxes. That, they often said, is precisely what the country could have used right about now. Yet as Harris tried appealing to as broad a swath of the Democratic electorate as possible, she found that in an overflowing field led by three far better-known characters, being a consensus-style candidate who can offer something to everyone meant it was especially difficult to offer everything to anyone.

When Harris sat down over the weekend to re-evaluate her plans and dig deep into her campaign’s financial state after a pair of brutal reports from the New York Times and Washington Post, she saw an operation quickly running out of cash and low on realistic paths to victory, even though she already qualified for the December debate. She spoke with family and close aides, and considered both her short-term options and her political future beyond the primary race. On Monday, she determined there was no politically acceptable way for her sputtering campaign to keep competing. She opted for an abrupt halt to a fall that would have been unfathomable back in Oakland in January, but which could have worsened in the unforgiving Iowa winter.

It would soon get harder, but at the time, the aftermath of the Detroit debate felt like a new low for Harris’s campaign. Looking back four months later, that stretch crystalized what went wrong. As she struggled to find a meeting of minds with the voters she needed between spring and fall — while Biden held onto his support and Elizabeth Warren gained steam — Harris and her team tried out a series of different messages. They didn’t stop trying until they ultimately settled on “Justice Is on the Ballot” late this year. Some political allies urged her to return to the “fearless” message she’d used while running for Senate in 2016. (“Fearless” was also the name of a TV ad she’d ran that was based around footage of Warren praising her.) Others grumbled that her early focus on “truths” meant little to voters, and that her subsequent “3 A.M. Agenda” wasn’t ambitious enough. “Sometimes her over-preparation comes across as a lack of preparation,” said one of her advisors. Still, most in Harris’s corner were convinced that she was close to hitting the right note. “The political consultant class gnashes their teeth over this — they have to market a product,” a Harris friend and longtime political ally told me this fall. “The problem that they have is: She is what she is. She’s complicated.” After the second debate, her team advised her to start telling more personal stories on the campaign trail, fearing the career prosecutor who was campaigning on her toughness was coming across as too lawyerly.

But then, and throughout the campaign, the advice wasn’t always consistent. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” one former Harris aide who remains close with her team told me repeatedly over the summer and fall. Harris has long been surrounded by a wide array of advisors — in addition to campaign chair Maya Harris (her sister), and campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, there were strategists Sean Clegg, Ace Smith, and Laphonza Butler, former chief of staff Rohini Kosoglu, adman Jim Margolis, and pollster David Binder, among others. “It’s a Kamala thing to have 9,000 people whispering in her ears, thinking they’re running the show,” said another of her ex-aides.

For nearly a year, her allies privately downplayed the importance of Iowa’s caucuses and New Hampshire’s primary to their ultimate strategy, insisting her strength would come in the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina, and then in the big March-voting states, beginning with California. But over the fall and early winter, Harris was forced to effectively shutter her campaign outside of Iowa and, to a lesser extent, South Carolina, in a dramatic but uncertain attempt to free up whatever resources were available for a last-ditch run at those states. (“I’m fucking moving to Iowa,” she was overheard telling Senator Mazie Hirono this fall.) As she slipped into fifth place or worse in national polling, and as she fell far behind in the first-to-caucus state where she bet it all, she cut her payroll and struggled to raise money, all while fighting off a widening stream of stories about disarray among remaining aides. Staff morale plummeted, and private finger-pointing burst into public, with her campaign manager and her sister mired in the middle.

Evidence existed that Harris was connecting with the voters who were still coming to see her and her latest message while she hosted intimate meet-ups and voter dinners — she often ended events hugging and consoling crying Iowans who’d just revealed stories of runaway health-care costs or job loss or gun violence. But her crowds were frequently dwarfed by most of her front-running rivals, as once-Kamala-curious Iowans who’d first seen her lighting up Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, and Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill gravitated elsewhere in the intervening months. And positive November developments — a well-received speech at the same closely-watched pre-caucus fundraising dinner that breathed life into Barack Obama’s campaign in 2007, an endorsement from the influential United Farm Workers union, Thanksgiving in Iowa, and a debate performance widely seen as a much-needed rebound — did little for her polling, which was stuck in mid-single digits, or her fundraising, which flatlined, then bottomed out. Where she was once a widely-liked contender frequently named as voters’ second choice candidate, her net favorability rating dropped by about 25 points in Iowa between June and November, according to in-state polling.

On a gray afternoon late this fall, Harris sat across from me on the second floor of a t-shirt shop in Cedar Rapids, her final stop on a three-day, six-town swing in the eastern part of the state, and explained that she thought voters had a hard time grasping her candidacy because they’d never seen a presidential hopeful quite like her.

Throughout her campaign, Harris, 55, projected a “Can you believe this shit?” air in public when talking about Donald Trump or the day’s latest outrage. But in person, when she was comfortable, she was more analytical. She could be startlingly jocular at times — once, in August, when we were finishing an interview on her campaign bus, rolling up to a Muscatine senior center where she’d lead the residents in a game of bingo, she exuberantly burst out singing, “B-I-N-G-O!” and exhorted her heretofore quiet aides to join in. But she was more often deliberate. Still, as her campaign matured and fumbled, she grew more open to allowing glimpses of how the Trump age and the presidential race hit her personally, which occasionally meant barely masking her frustration.

At the t-shirt shop, she raised her eyebrows and, with a little smile that then turned serious, said she’d been thinking about something, and was going to try it out on me. She was going to say a phrase, and would ask what image I pictured in response. “The boy next door,” she said, then paused. That week, all the buzz on the ground in the state had been about Pete Buttigieg. “There is an image there. And you can think about certain people on the debate stage that could be attributed to.”

“Are there four words who would describe who I am? There’s no frame of reference,” she continued. Exactly a week later she’d announce a mass staff layoff and underscore the extent of her bet on Iowa, to try and catch up to Buttigieg, but also Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren. “Like, we have terms for that guy. He’s the boy next door. That’s your uncle, who’s at the Thanksgiving dinner, who does this thing and that. There are images. The girl next door, there’s an image for that, too.”

“Is there enough time?” one of Harris’s longest-standing political allies asked me as early as September. “I don’t know.” A few weeks later, most of the political world had decided, basically, that there was not. That didn’t stop Harris advisors from pointing out that in late 2003 — the last time a Republican president loathed by the left was up for re-election — John Kerry still trailed Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt in Iowa, which he then won. Perhaps thinking it unwise to compare herself to Kerry, Harris never talked much about that race. But late this fall, after months of pleas from her aides to tell more personal stories, she started speaking about her own time in Iowa 12 years ago, door-knocking for another candidate who was still far behind at that point. Obama’s campaign, too, was described as listless and overmatched before its own Iowa relaunch.

Often, she’d tell the story of meeting an elderly woman at an African-American senior center in Des Moines the night before the 2008 caucuses and convincing her to turn out for Obama even after the woman told her, “They not gonna let him win.” Harris would make the case that her challenge was simply convincing voters she could beat Trump. But by that point, the comeback she’d need just to stay in the game in Iowa — a state where voters and kingmakers pride themselves on their discernment and their patience in making up their minds — was far bigger than both Obama’s and Kerry’s were. In October, I spotted former Iowa Representative Dave Nagle hanging out in the back of a Harris town hall in Waterloo. Nagle, who left Congress 26 years ago and hasn’t endorsed any 2020 candidate, praised Harris’s ambitions in the state, but was far from convinced: He said she had dropped by his office building earlier in the year for a separate meeting, but had neglected to stop by and say hello to him. “As Charlie Brown said, there’s no greater burden than great potential,” he said.

At the time, Harris’s advisors were insisting she could still win if she finished in the top three in Iowa (some privately said top two), and they hoped Trump’s impeachment would return the former prosecutor to voters’ minds. Harris herself, though, hesitated to call the inquiry good for her campaign when Nancy Pelosi first announced it. When I asked her the next day, by phone, whether her history in law enforcement might give her an opening during months of impeachment talk, she replied, “Well, I mean, I suppose there is that.” Soon, though, she became convinced she could make up ground by focusing on Trump: She took to calling him a “walking indictment in a red tie.” Later in the fall, she told me: “He literally told us who he is when he said, ‘I could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue.’ He was saying, ‘I can commit a crime,’ meaning, ‘I’m willing to think that I might, and if I do, I would get away with it.”

Still, “I understand!,” she said of voters’ hesitation while addressing a local party fundraiser in a dark DoubleTree hotel ballroom in Cedar Rapids in October. “People are saying, ‘Maybe it’s not your turn, maybe it’s not your time,’” she continued, over the clink of silverware. “But I will tell you, Linn County, I’ve heard this conversation in every campaign I have — and now here’s the operative word — won.” She was trying to convince Iowans she was still worth considering as her campaign — running perilously low on cash — scrambled to raise enough money to put a new ad on air, or even online. She repeated the line until the campaign’s final days.

The first time I heard a journalist straight-up ask Harris if she would run for president was less than two months after she joined the Senate in 2017. The first time one of her then-likely opponents described to me why she’d be a serious contender was that summer. The first time I heard someone in her orbit outline her possible path to the nomination was before the midterms. This autumn, when it was becoming clear that Harris was struggling to break through to the surprisingly solid top rank of candidates, I started hearing from a quiet cadre in her orbit that believed if she could find a way to last long enough in the race — deep into next year — she might be well positioned to compete in a contested convention next July. That view gained purchase among some of her most loyal supporters, who saw a drawn-out fight as a very long-shot best-case scenario.

But others, including many in her inner circle, wondered how much longer Harris would be willing to stay in a race where she was stuck responding to others and unable to gain attention on her own terms. One of their concerns: That Harris’s name would remain on the California ballot even if she was no longer a viable candidate by the state’s March primary, which could lead to an embarrassing result that further weakened her political standing at home. Even after what Harris’s team thought was a standout performance at November’s debate, it was Buttigieg who gained the most potential new supporters in its immediate aftermath, according to FiveThirtyEight’s overnight polling. Among some aides and allies, whispers about Harris’s future were common — whether she might have a future in someone else’s presidential cabinet; whether she might have to worry about a primary challenge to her Senate seat in 2022; or if there might be room for her to run for the presidency again in 2024 (if Trump is re-elected) or 2028. “I do think she has another shot at this,” said Randi Weingarten, the influential president of the American Federation of Teachers union, in late October.

Harris herself never talked this way, of course — until the final days, she’d pepper her speeches with “I intend to win!” — but she thought, and spoke, more about representation, and what her candidacy meant, in recent weeks. “The feeling that I have, the sense of responsibility to be on that stage, and to do well on that stage because of that responsibility — I never want to disappoint anybody,” she told me in Cedar Rapids, reflecting on her status as the most prominent black woman candidate ever, and just the second since Shirley Chisholm nearly half a century earlier, and a child of immigrants. This was a conversation she’d had with her family when she first decided to run, she said. “Because I know what being on that stage means to a lot of people, and for a lot of people. And I carry that, as something that is heavy. Meaning it is very important.”

Harris’s struggle to get the right voters to truly understand her pitch began the day after her Oakland launch. Rarely has a campaign gone from such a high to damage control so immediately. Speaking with Jake Tapper in Des Moines for a televised town hall, Harris answered a question about private health-care coverage by unspooling a long answer about insurance company bureaucracy that included the line, “Let’s eliminate all of that, let’s move on.” Harris had been the first senator to sign onto Sanders’s famous Medicare for All bill a year-and-a-half earlier, but she’d also co-sponsored a more modest scheme that would permit private insurance in some cases, so it wasn’t yet clear how she’d position herself in the race. The next day, a Harris advisor told CNN she would be open to moderate proposals allowing for some private insurance coverage, and thus began a mind-numbing saga that turned into a media proxy for Harris’s ideological flexibility and unwillingness to be pinned down on policy. In April, she told Pod Save America: “I’m not saying we need to get rid of private insurance.”

By May, she was trying to get off the health-care topic as she leaned into her prosecutorial experience on the trail as a way of contrasting directly with Trump, a pivot that inflamed internal campaign tensions — and questions about decision flow — that were never resolved. On one side was Harris’s sister Maya, her campaign chair who is especially attuned to the activist left. On the other was a set of Harris’s strategists including Clegg and Smith, who saw more opportunity in a more moderate tack. Then, in June, she raised her hand on the debate stage when asked if candidates would “abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan,” only to, afterward, say she thought the question was if she’d give up her own coverage. Finally, in July, Harris released her own plan, with a longer transition period away from private insurance than Sanders’s, but a narrative was already set about her caution and perceived flip-flops. It was en vogue then to compare her to Marco Rubio — a GOP Establishment favorite “candidate of the future,” until he wasn’t, in 2016 — or, as Nate Silver did, to Mitt Romney: “Hits all her marks, positioned quite optimally toward the middle of the primary electorate and has the potential to unite different wings — but voters aren’t entirely clear what she stands for,” he tweeted late that month.

For left-wing activists already suspicious of Harris because of her prosecutorial record, it was all further evidence that she was no true progressive. For wary moderates and conservatives, it was reason enough to think she stood for radical change. All the while, Biden’s support was holding firm and Warren’s was only growing, contrary to the long-standing projections of Harris’s inner circle. Behind the scenes, aides agreed Harris needed a serious fix, and soon, but the lack of a clear chain of command bogged down their decision-making, and territorial tensions ruled out collaboration between some of the team’s most important players.

Yet Warren’s rise through the summer was also forcing Harris into a conversation she found counterproductive, especially during her first extended tour of Iowa, in August. “No false choices” had been something of a personal slogan of hers earlier in her career, and she now saw no contradiction in saying one day that she was not trying to restructure society and another standing for the Green New Deal and eliminating the Senate filibuster to achieve it. Harris refused to pinpoint herself on the Biden-to-Sanders political spectrum, even when asked point-blank. “I think it’s just a nice subject for a graduate class, but it’s not how people are living life,” she told Bloomberg. Later that day, while meeting with farmers in Lacona, Iowa, she said, unprompted, “You don’t have the luxury of engaging in some intellectual political conversation about what we need to grow and thrive.”

“It is frustrating,” she said to me the next day on her shiny black campaign bus (with “KAMALA” written on its side in yellow, blue, and red). “And it’s frustrating because — I mean, this sounds so cliche — but it’s the labels, right? And it tends to oversimplify issues, and it tends to reward or induce a requirement to have really discrete — and not many — categories. And so, ‘Which of these few categories do you fit in?’ Those categories that have been pre-designated, by the way, by other people. And I just refuse to do that.” She leaned forward with her arms crossed, sitting across from a map of the state stuck up on the wall with pins marking her stops in the state. A handful of aides sat around, listening quietly and nodding knowingly. Some pretended not to be listening in. They’d all heard this from her before, and would again. This question “never comes up with voters,” she said. “It never comes up with voters Never! Voters don’t have time for that.”

Harris then decided to play strategist. Upon leaving the state, she called each member of her senior staff. The political territory in Iowa felt more fertile than expected, she told them, and, recalling her time campaigning for Obama in 2007, she said she saw an opportunity to compete seriously there if she could spend enough time on the ground to prove she could win. She directed Rodriguez to draw up an entirely new plan: To make sure she’d now have enough resources to compete in Iowa and increase her in-state staffing, and to fill the fall with stops in the state. In September, she announced her first surprise pivot to Iowa. Soon after, she redrew her campaign’s organization to give Kosoglu a formal role and hand Butler direct reports, aiming to establish order.

That discipline never arrived, and she also spent nearly all of late August and September off the trail, raising money — which was supposed to come easier to her given her history running high-dollar campaigns in California, but which was both an increasingly difficult task amid Buttigieg’s rise and her plateauing polls, and doubly important to fund her Iowa push. For over a month, she didn’t visit Iowa. When she started returning, her crowds were smaller, the focus elsewhere. With the media’s eyes on other candidates, Harris resumed talking about health-care — promoting her proposal’s protection of union workers’ plans, and calling it “Medicare for All.”

A few weeks later, she tried putting a more positive spin on the lingering questions about her political identity. Harris was in Los Angeles, taking a quick break from a West Coast fundraising swing, and when I asked about her struggles explaining her health-care position to a national audience, she grew reflective. “It can often just be the inability to see something they’ve never seen before, so they want to put it in a box that they have seen before. So it’s maybe an oversimplification. That’s the challenge, really,” she said, sounding far less exasperated than on the bus, slightly more at peace with this existential challenge. She was “asking people to see something they’ve never seen before. And I know it is asking a lot, and I say, based on experience: I know people are up for it.”

In September, a Los Angeles Times survey revealed that Democratic voters identified Harris as their closest ideological fit, after all. A week later, a poll conducted by Binder, working for another client, showed her slipping into sixth place in Iowa, down 13 points from mid-summer.

Since the day Harris launched her campaign in January, some Democrats in her orbit wondered aloud whether it’d be worth starting a super PAC to support her. The notion was always knocked down as other candidates rejected help from such outside groups, but the idea never quite died.

Late Tuesday morning, operatives monitoring TV ad spending noticed that a brand-new super PAC had started placing buys to run a pro-Harris spot in Iowa. It was a last-ditch, million dollar effort created by long-time aides to prop her up as her own campaign effectively ran out of cash as she criss-crossed the state. The cavalry wasn’t quite arriving to save her, but here, at least, was a much-needed last-second boost. The plan was to air a minute-long video that featured Harris grilling Barr, Kavanaugh, and Sessions, and closed by calling her “the Democrat for president that Donald Trump fears most.”

Early Tuesday afternoon, Harris got on a conference call with what remained of her campaign staff. She thanked them for their work, but told them this was the end of the road.

“I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,” she wrote in a final email to supporters. “I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do.”

Within an hour, the super PAC canceled its ad buy.

But the group isn’t completely adrift. “We said if somehow this one doesn’t work out we’ll go with that one,” said Scott, who said they’ve been closely monitoring two other candidates. “We go deep into planning.”

Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next.

The California senator left the race after support and fundraising slumped — but after nearly 11 months she had amassed a well-regarded bounty of supporters, particularly among black Democrats.

AD

The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters.

AD

At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women.

The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.

AD

“I don’t know who needs to hear this but stay the [expletive] away from the Harris field,” wrote Dvorsky on Twitter. “Of course you want them to work for you. They’re freaking amazing. And sad. And grieving. Sit all the way down. They know where you live. They’ll get back to. Or not.”

A spokesman for Harris didn’t reply to questions about whether she would endorse another candidate in the race.

AD

By 9 a.m. Wednesday, less than a day after Harris’s surprise departure became public, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign announced he had won the endorsement of Mitch Henry, a key Iowa figure who had been a member of Harris’s Iowa Latinx steering committee.

In the hours after Harris left the race, everyone from her finance team, to a local South Carolina gun control activist to members of Congress who had sided with her were hearing pitches.

AD

Four campaigns — and one presidential candidate — reached out to Iowa state Rep. Ross Wilburn of Ames within 24 hours of Harris leaving the race.

“It was just offers of support, one or two with more of a pointed ‘here’s what my candidate brings to the table,’ ” Wilburn said, adding that he received a call from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and campaign officials representing former vice president Joe Biden, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and Sens. Warren and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

AD

Other Harris supporters also were girding for a full-court press from candidates, with Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, warning the white candidates not to “pander.”

AD

“What have you done in the past that will give me an indication of what you will do in the future for people of color?” Fudge asked, explaining what she wants to hear. “A lot of people have great plans. But if you put a plan together without the input of the very people you say you want to help, that is just as pandering to me as anything else.”

“We like Warren. We like Sanders. We like Biden. We like our neighbor in South Bend,” said another caucus member, Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.), referring to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of the Indiana city. “We’re just deciding which one we like the most at the moment.”

AD

During her campaign, Harris didn’t fit neatly into a particular ideological lane, meaning that there was no single obvious beneficiary of her departure.

AD

In South Carolina, some observers assume much of Harris’s support could go to Biden, who already is well known among African Americans there.

But Warren also is positioned to benefit, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a group trying to elevate women of color in American politics.

“She’s been focusing on intersectional policies that directly address race and gender,” Allison said. “Warren and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders are beneficiaries of the latest dynamic.”

Many of Harris’s donors were already looking elsewhere. Roughly half of more than 100 well-connected fundraisers who raised at least $25,000 for Harris’s campaign also gave the maximum donation to some of her Democratic rivals, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.

AD

AD

Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic donor, jumped on board with Harris shortly after her campaign launched in Oakland in January. But later, Buell also supported Buttigieg.

When asked about Harris’s campaign shortly before she dropped out of the race, Buell said in a text message: “Sad that Kamala didn’t do better but she wasn’t ready.”

Buell added on Wednesday that she is now fully backing Buttigieg: “I am seeing his effective, creative campaign as a symbol of his leadership qualities. The energy and focus in the campaign is very positive and impressive.”

The ultimate fight will be for the individual voters who backed Harris, including people like Vanessa Phelan, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mother of two from Des Moines.

AD

Not long after Harris dropped out, texts started to come in from organizers of other campaigns. “It was, like, ‘Not today Satan,’ ” she said.

AD

Phelan said she will eventually settle on another candidate but isn’t sure when. The hardest part of Harris’s decision to quit, she said, was explaining it to her 4-year-old daughter Zoe.

“Kamala ran out of money,” Phelan told her.

The little girl looked at her mother with wide eyes, trying to understand. “I’ll give Kamala my piggy bank,” her mother recalled Zoe saying. “I want her to be president.”

There's little chance that impeachment will remove President Trump from office. But one Wall Street strategist notes that it could complicate his reelection path.

Economic forecasters have predicted that Trump should cruise to a second term next year given the strength of the economy. But a new analysis from JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that the onslaught of coverage of impeachment and Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is drowning out the positive economic news he needs to win.

The dynamic highlights the challenge facing the White House as it pursues a split-screen strategy depicting Trump as focused on his agenda while congressional Democrats press ahead with impeachment.

Michael Cembalest, JPMorgan Asset Management's chairman of market and investment strategy, lays out the quandary facing Trump in a pair of charts. First, Cembalest crunched a raft of data to conclude Trump is heading into the 2020 campaign with the strongest economic tail winds going back to 1896.

The measures blended more than a century of readings on consumer price inflation, the jobless rate, the change in that rate, per capita economic growth, how that growth compares to that of other leading economies, stock market returns, and home price appreciation, among others:

But viewers tuning into primetime CNN and MSNBC from 8 to 10 p.m. over a year-long period ending in September saw barely a blip about positive economic developments. Instead, the Mueller investigation and Russian interference in the 2016 election overwhelmingly dominated those airwaves, followed by coverage of Trump’s personal conduct in office, then immigration issues, then administration corruption:

Trump critics will contend the president has earned that coverage through his behavior, while he merely inherited an economic expansion that has mostly continued apace. Cembalest mostly agrees: “Trump deserves the coverage he’s getting from those news outlets,” he tells me.

But he wrote the note to illustrate something he observed in his own home: His wife, a devoted MSNBC watcher, hears a version of the news that bears little resemblance to what he sees all day studying market and economic indicators. The divide both fuels and is fueled by a broader Balkanization of the electorate that suggests the traditional relationship between the economy's performance and the president’s political fortunes may be breaking down.

By matching historical economic data to presidential election outcomes, economists at Moody’s Analytics, Oxford Economics and Trend Macrolytics have all projected Trump will secure reelection more easily than his first win, barring a serious economic downturn. But the more relevant point of comparison may be 2018. An analysis Cembalest conducted after the election found that measured against the strength of the economy, Republicans suffered the worst midterm losses by a president’s party in at least a century.

The finding could reframe Trump’s political incentives in waging his trade war. Conventional wisdom has held the president keeps up the fight at his own peril, since it remains arguably the greatest menace to continued economic growth.

But if he can galvanize his base by stoking confrontation with the Chinese — and that outweighs whatever economic costs it brings — it may be in Trump’s interest to keep putting off a deal. “I think that’s true up to a point,” Cembalest says, arguing if the president goes forward with December 15 tariffs heavily targeting consumer goods, ""I think he’d lose them, because the global recession that could result would offset the benefits from the base. He has to figure out how to conduct the trade war” with lower stakes.

Some support for the theory comes from across the Atlantic. “Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, both of Bocconi University in Milan, study election results in 15 European countries,” per The Economist. “They find that areas facing greater competition from Chinese imports were more likely to vote for nationalist parties.”

More from that piece, titled ""Does the economy affect elections anymore?"": “The old straightforward relationship between the economic cycle and elections could yet return. But the implication of the new research is that support for populism is a deeper-rooted feature of Western economies… Voters care less than they used to about the economy's immediate impact on their wallets. But they care more than ever about how the economy shapes their identity--their sense of security, and their freedom.”

MARKET MOVERS

— Growth stumbles for services sector, private payrolls. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: ""U.S. services sector activity slowed in November as lingering concerns about trade tensions and worker shortages pushed production to its lowest level in a decade, which could heighten fears about the economy’s health. Other data on Wednesday showed private employers hired the fewest workers in six months in November. The reports came on the heels of data on Monday showing manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November and a decline in construction spending in October.

""The continued manufacturing slump and second straight monthly drop in construction outlays tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter, which had been boosted by a rush of upbeat reports on the trade deficit, housing and business investment. Still, the economy appears to be growing at a moderate pace rather than stalling.""

— Stocks snap losing streak. MarketWatch's Andrea Riquier: ""U.S. stocks closed higher for the first time in four sessions following a report that a phase-one trade U.S.-China trade deal was still in the works, helping to offset fears of a delay sparked a day earlier by [Trump’s] remarks.

""The money manager found in an analysis of earnings that more than a third of S&P 500 companies have posted a year-over-year decline in earnings in 2019. The last times the share of companies posting contracting earnings was that high: 2009, 2008 and 2002, all periods when the broader economy, plus the stock market, were in decline.

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— Mnuchin warns of issues with global tax rewrite: “The U.S. has ‘serious concerns’ with proposals being discussed in the global rewrite of corporate tax rules, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as he introduced a new idea that could complicate a deal over adapting the tax system for the digital economy,” the Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin and Paul Hannon report.

“In a letter to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Mr. Mnuchin cited concerns raised by U.S. businesses. He said that changing the mandatory rules for when countries have the right to tax companies could affect ‘longstanding pillars of the international tax system upon which U.S. taxpayers rely’ … Nevertheless, Mr. Mnuchin’s reservations come as a surprise given that the broad outlines of new rules agreed to in October were based on ideas advanced by the U.S., which has long pushed for measures that cover all companies, not just those whose businesses are highly digital.”

— Dems see USMCA deal on horizon: “‘We are on the 2 1/2-yard line,’ Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said about efforts to wrap up negotiations on the replacement for Nafta and clear the way for approval in Congress,” Bloomberg News’s Erik Wasson and Eric Martin report.

“Mexico’s top trade negotiator, Jesus Seade, was meeting … with his Trump administration counterpart Robert Lighthizer in Washington in an attempt to resolve final issues. Neal said rank-and-file Democrats would be briefed on the details of the talks later in the day. California Representative Jimmy Gomez, a member of the U.S. House Democrats negotiating team, said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Lighthizer have offered Mexico a compromise on labor enforcement that ‘respects Mexico’s sovereignty.’ ”

— China slams Pompeo over Huawei: “China’s envoy to the European Union hit back at what he called politically motivated U.S. warnings that Chinese telecom equipment makers should be kept out of European 5G networks,” Politico’s Laurens Cerulus reports.

“In response to an op-ed in Politico by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the head of the Chinese Mission to the EU said that claims about Huawei were ‘a far cry from the truth …’ “While Pompeo attacks the Chinese Communist Party and proudly claims the moral high ground, he forgets about the NSA’s notorious PRISM surveillance program and the wiretapping of America’s closest allies,” the Chinese diplomat added … Zhang was responding to the opinion article published Monday in which Pompeo wrote that ‘it’s critical that European countries not give control of their critical infrastructure to Chinese tech giants like Huawei, or ZTE.’ ”

POCKET CHANGE

— Amazon cloud boss chides Pentagon: “‘It’s fairly obvious that we feel pretty strongly that it was not adjudicated fairly,’ Amazon Web Services chief executive Andy Jassy said during a news conference at the company’s annual conference [in Las Vegas]. ‘If you do a truly objective, detailed, apples-to-apples comparison with the platforms, you don’t end up in a spot where the decision was made,’” my colleague Jay Greene reports.

“The contract, valued at up to $10 billion over 10 years, was awarded to Microsoft in October, and Amazon has formally challenged the Pentagon’s decision, filing a protest with the Court of Federal Claims last month that cites comments by President Trump as indicating bias against Amazon. Trump has repeatedly criticized Amazon, whose founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.”

— Under Pichai, Alphabet could face more scrutiny: “Alphabet’s leadership change has some investors hoping that the owner of Google will take a hard look at the cash-burning ventures championed by its founders,” Reuters’s Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich report.

“Shares of Alphabet rose 2% ... with some investors saying Pichai’s pragmatic approach and his background at Alphabet’s core business may make him less patient about money-losing projects fostered in recent years by [Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin]. One of the biggest changes for Pichai will be taking responsibility for those so-called ‘moonshots,’ which are aimed at diversifying Alphabet’s business.”

What those “moonshots” include: “Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.”

“Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.” Just how much is a Google worth?: Page and Brin “just got a $2.3 billion retirement gift from investors,” Bloomberg News’s Tom Metcalf reports. “They each own about 6% of the internet giant and still control Alphabet through special voting shares.""

— Expedia’s CEO, CFO ousted: “Expedia Group Inc.’s chief executive and finance chief were both forced to resign after clashing with Chairman Barry Diller and the board over the direction of the travel company,” the WSJ’s Patrick Thomas reports.

“The website that helps users find hotel rooms and flights said Wednesday that CEO Mark Okerstrom and financial chief Alan Pickerill would step down immediately from their roles, at the behest of the board. Expedia’s brands include Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire and CarRentals.com.”

— Italy claims Fiat massively undervalued Chrysler: “Italian tax authorities have claimed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV underestimated the value of its American business by 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion) following its phased acquisition several years ago, presenting the carmaker with a potentially hefty bill as it prepares to merge with French rival PSA Group,” Bloomberg’s Daniele Lepido,Tommaso Ebhardt and Ania Nussbaum report.

“The dispute relates to the October 2014 restructuring that took place after the former Fiat SpA purchased the final part of its Chrysler unit, according to company filings and an Oct. 22 audit report seen by Bloomberg. The purchases stretched over five years and culminated in the full takeover of the once-bankrupt owner of brands such as Dodge, Ram and Jeep.”

— Billionaire, in need of cash: “Elon Musk says he doesn’t have a lot of cash. Musk’s wealth came up in the second day of his testimony before a federal jury in Los Angeles where the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive is on trial over a tweet in which he referred to a British cave expert as a ‘pedo guy,’” Bloomberg’s Dana Hull, Edvard Pettersson, and Tom Metcalf report.

“After an unsuccessful objection from his lawyer, Musk told the jury he has Tesla stock, and SpaceX stock, with debt against those holdings, and his net worth is about $20 billion. But contrary to public opinion, he said, he didn’t have much cash. Musk finished testifying after a total of about six hours on the stand over two days.”

— Walmart talks about how it collects data: “Walmart Inc for the first time … revealed the breadth of customer information it collects as it came out in favor of consumers having ‘reasonable controls’ with regard to collection, use and sharing of personal data,” Reuters’s Nandita Bose reports.

“The world’s largest retailer said shoppers should have an opportunity to ‘reasonably access, correct or delete their data while limiting the sale of their data to third parties and its use in digital advertising,’ as it testified at a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The hearing, which was also attended by companies like Microsoft, was convened to examine various legislative proposals to protect consumer data privacy.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)

— Biden releases $3.2 trillion tax plan: “Former vice president Joe Biden released a plan to raise $3.2 trillion in taxes over 10 years to pay for his domestic spending proposals, including on health care and climate, as he seeks to cast himself as the fiscal moderate in the Democratic presidential primary amid pressure from his liberal rivals,” my colleague Jeff Stein reports.

“Biden’s plan calls for raising the tax rate paid by corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent, still below the 35 percent level in place before the 2017 GOP tax cut law. He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures … The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.”

How it compares: “The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s. Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.”

Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.” Less aggressive than it could have been: “Biden also opts not to adopt more-aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign, including a new tax on Wall Street transactions … Similarly, Biden proposes increasing the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent, where it was before the 2017 GOP tax law. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.”

The fight over Harris’s donors has begun: Sen. Kamala Harris’s “most affluent fundraisers, spanning from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, have been receiving calls and emails from people close to top-tier candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker. These people are hoping to snag the support of the bundlers and their donor networks,” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz reports.

Warren trolls Bloomberg on Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren accused former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg of trying to buy the 2020 election with millions of dollars in advertising to fuel his late entry into the Democratic race,” Bloomberg’s Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou and Joe Weisenthal report.

“Warren delivered her message in an interview on Bloomberg Television from the company’s headquarters in New York City. ‘I don’t believe that elections ought to be for sale,’ Warren said. ‘And I don’t think as a Democratic Party that we should say that the only way you’re going to get elected, the only way you’re going to be our nominee, is either if you are a billionaire or if you’re sucking up to billionaires.’”

That wasn’t all: Before the interview, Warren bought an ad to air on the network that directly attacked its owner-turned-candidate:

Warren proposes crackdown on bank mergers. NYT's Jeanna Smialek: ""Warren plans to introduce a bill in coming weeks that would intensify the scrutiny of bank mergers, a signal less of legislative action to come than of her intentions for the finance industry if she is elected president.

""The bill, a companion of which will be introduced Wednesday in the House by Representative Jesús 'Chuy' García, Democrat of Illinois, will almost certainly go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. But its argument that the 'review process for bank mergers is fundamentally broken' indicates that Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, still has the financial industry in her sights.""

New Georgia senator is ready to cut a big check to her campaign: “Soon-to-be Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler plans to spend $20 million of her own money on her 2020 Senate campaign in Georgia — a massive sum that could give potential rivals pause about trying to unseat her,” Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports.

“Loeffler, a wealthy financial executive and co-owner of Atlanta’s WNBA team, was tapped Wednesday morning to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who is resigning later this month due to health problems, on an interim basis. She has told advisers in recent days of her intentions to tap her vast fortune to win next year's special election to complete Isakson's term, according to a person with direct knowledge of the decision.”

Loeffler is heavily connected to Bitcoin: “Loeffler has been the chief executive of Bakkt, the Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin-focused subsidiary, since the entity’s announcement in August 2018,” Coindesk’s Nikhilesh De reports. “Under her tenure, the company rolled out its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts earlier this year.

She also used to be directly connected to the NYSE: Loeffler was “the chief communications and marketing officer and head of investor relations for the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange, a financial trading platform that owns the New York Stock Exchange,” the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Jim Denery writes. “Intercontinental Exchange was founded by Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher.”

Sundar Pichai has been acting like Alphabet’s top leader in Washington for more than a year. Now, it’s official.

Alphabet CEO Larry Page and President Sergey Brin made a surprise announcement yesterday that they are stepping away from day-to-day operations at the company they co-founded, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports. They’re handing the reins over to Pichai, thrusting the Google CEO into the top role at Alphabet at perhaps the most critical juncture in its 21-year-history. The company is confronting broad political backlash over potentially anti-competitive behavior, its data collection practices and even election security, among other controversies.

But Pichai’s new job title will probably have little immediate effect on the company’s political battles. He’s already been on the front lines and weathering the techlash in Washington in the absence of Page, who he reported to until yesterday.

Page was largely missing in action in Washington for more than a year. Senators tore him apart last September when he was a no-show at an Intelligence Committee hearing with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey.

Pichai — who also declined to testify at that hearing — was left to clean up the mess solo. He held quiet meetings with members of Congress, the White House and Pentagon officials to smooth things over. He was the executive the company later sent to Washington for a Capitol Hill grilling. President Trump even targeted Pichai personally in tweets over the summer as he attacked Google, without evidence, for being biased against conservatives.

Pichai has also been leading the company's annual developer conference and quarterly investor call, Greg notes.

The new Alphabet CEO has “effectively been the spokesperson for Google and for Alphabet for a while now,” Alan Davidson, who opened Google's Washington office in 2005 and now serves as Mozilla vice president of global policy, trust and security, told me in an interview.

Pichai’s treatment in Washington hasn’t been all that different from other embattled tech titans, like Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey. The only distinction was that unlike those executives, Pichai didn’t have the top role in the company’s organization chart.

But he was overseeing the products regulators are most worried about, including YouTube as well as the company’s search and advertising businesses. Alphabet, the Google parent company established in 2015, encompasses a much wider range of businesses, including the self-driving car division Waymo, the smart-home appliance maker Nest and other “moonshot initiatives.” But regulators have largely not paid attention to the company's organizational structure.

“Regulators have seen Google and Alphabet as largely synonymous,” Davidson said. “This move is not going to change any of that.”

Page will not have an operational role at the company for the first time since Google's founding, though he and Brin will retain their board seats and company shares. The announcement marks the end of an era, especially because the two co-founders played an integral role in shaping the values that have defined the company politically, Davidson said.

“They played pivotal role in deciding what Google stood for,"" he said.

They also shaped the company's unique corporate culture — which was widely celebrated until recent years, as divisions between employees and management broke out over issues ranging from the company's work with the Pentagon to its handling of sexual harassment claims.

BITS: Genius Media Group is suing Google for lifting lyrics from its site and engaging in what it claims amounts to anti-competitive practices, the Wall Street Journal's Robert McMillan reports. The lawsuit puts a spotlight on how the search giant can stymie smaller rivals as regulators open antitrust probes into Google and other tech titans.

The lawsuit seeks $50 million in combined minimum damages from Google and LyricFind, the company that provides lyrics for Google's information panels on its search page. Genius alleges that its search traffic plummeted after Google began publishing lyrics on its search results page and that Google and LyricFind violated the website's terms of service. The company found more than 1,000 instances of its watermarked lyrics appearing on Google's website since August. In one instance, when Google posted lyrics directly to its search page, site traffic to Genius's lyrics page plummeted 70 percent.

Yelp and Trip Advisor have also publicly accused Google of favoring its own content in search results to stifle competition.

NIBBLES: Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been one of the loudest advocates for breaking up Big Techl. Now the Massachusetts Democrat is drafting legislation to strengthen antitrust law, bringing her battle with Silicon Valley to the Senate, The Information's Ashley Gold reports.

The legislation would give the regulators more authority to punish violations of antitrust laws, Ashley reports. A draft tentatively titled the""Anti-Monopoly and Competition Restoration Act"" is circulating in Washington.

“Introducing a bill on antitrust would allow Warren to claim she is doing something while on the campaign trail about what she says is an excessive concentration of power among companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet,"" Gold writes.

Warren's campaign previously released a plan outlining how she proposes to break up the tech giants, such as breaking off WhatsApp from Facebook. Her plan would also prevent companies like Amazon and Apple from peddling their own products or apps on the platforms they manage.

There's bipartisan support of greater antitrust scrutiny, especially as state attorneys general from both political parties open a flurry of antitrust investigations into tech giants. But any major overhaul of antitrust law is unlikely to pass as Congress is focused on an election year and the impeachment inquiry.

BYTES: YouTube reports that U.S. viewers spent 70 percent less time watching videos that advance conspiracies and other debunked theories following changes it made earlier this year, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports.

The Google-owned company didn't release additional figures, such as how much time viewers still spend on the videos or how often they're clicked.

YouTube now pushes users toward news sources and creators it deems “high-authority"" when searching for news events, the company says. For instance, in searches for news events such as “Brexit,” 93 percent of the top 10 recommended videos are from creators YouTube deems “high-authority.” The company didn't disclose its sample size for that data, however. And many viewers of conspiracy content subscribe directly to the channels that promote it, Greg reports.

“There will always be content on YouTube that brushes up against our policies, but doesn’t quite cross the line,” YouTube said in the blog post. “We’ve been working to raise authoritative voices on YouTube and reduce the spread of borderline content and harmful misinformation.”

The company's efforts to reduce viewership of unreliable information follows significant criticism of its moderation policies. In January it adjusted its algorithms to reduce recommendations of unreliable content.

-- Four recently fired Google employees announced their intent to file charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging they were fired in retaliation for organizing workers at the tech giant, Ryan Mac at BuzzFeed News reports. The complaint could spark a wide investigation into the search giant's labor practices as it attempts to crack down on internal unrest.

“We participated in legally protected labor organizing, fighting to improve workplace conditions for all Google workers,” Laurence Berland, Rebecca Rivers, Paul Duke and Sophie Waldman, the four fired employees, wrote in a letter posted on Medium. “Google didn’t respond by honoring its values, or abiding by the law. It responded like a large corporation more interested in revenue growth than in ensuring worker rights and ethical conduct.”

“We dismissed four individuals who were engaged in intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data security policies, including systematically accessing and disseminating other employees’ materials and work,” a Google representative told BuzzFeed. “No one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company’s activities.”

An internal memo said that the employees were fired for searching, accessing and distributing information including the calendars of other employees outside the company, Bloomberg News reported last week.

At a campaign rally in Atlanta for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a day after the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, dozens of charter school supporters interrupted Warren’s speech to protest the presidential candidate’s plan to curb charter school growth. The New York Times reported the protesters were members of the Freedom Coalition for Charter Schools, an alliance of black and Latino education leaders, who toted signs that read “Charter schools = self-determination,” and “Black Democrats want charters!”

Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, a black lawmaker and Warren surrogate, threw the presidential candidate a life preserver. “We are grateful for your activism and your voice, and you are welcome here,” Pressley told the activists. But she also made it very clear that Warren’s voice would not be silenced.

It was, once again, an example of black leaders rushing to the rescue. Oddly enough, the charter activists and Pressley were both coming to the defense of white-led causes that could stand more vigorous feedback from black people. Because Democrats have to earn the black vote in black cities, the black community has leverage to demand that our concerns be addressed.

Warren needs to learn from black voices — but the charter school movement is not ours to defend.

Organizations such as the charter school advocacy group Families for Excellent Schools have orchestrated statewide campaigns using dark money to influence state ballots to increase the number of charter schools, hiding who’s actually behind the movement. The Associated Press reported in December 2018 that an advocacy group that received $1.5 million from the Walton Family Foundation, one of the biggest funders of education reform, paid for 150, mostly black parents from Memphis to travel to Cincinnati two years prior to protest at a meeting of the NAACP. The parents sought to lobby against an NAACP proposal — which the organization passed despite the protests — to call for a moratorium on charter schools. They denied that the Walton Family Foundation asked them to carry out the protest.

This political season, black people cannot afford to be human shields for white leaders who don’t have the legitimacy to enter black communities on their own.

Democrats vying for the presidency have mostly backed off from endorsing charter schools, a reversal of the party position, which has largely supported these publicly financed, independently run schools since the Clinton administration. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, two leading Democratic presidential candidates who represent the progressive wing of the party, have been the most aggressive in their proposals to curb the growth of charter schools.

AD

Warren’s K-12 education proposal would eliminate the Federal Charter School Program, which provides financial resources to start charter schools. And, if elected, she has promised to ban for-profit charter schools outright. Sanders would freeze all federal funding to charters. The Democratic Party now poses the biggest existential threat to the charter school sector.

AD

This reversal of position by Democrats is a sign that members of the party are listening to black communities.

After more than 25 years of charter development, it's almost cliché to say that the research is mixed on charter schools' academic benefits as measured by standardized test scores. At best, advocates can say there are specific charter networks that generate higher academic outcomes. There are exceptionally good and bad charter schools, just as there are exceptionally good and bad non-charter public schools, which isn’t saying much about the efficacy of chartering as a solution. If we are to embrace charter schools politically, they better bring additional benefits to black communities. And this is something charters have failed to do.

AD

Over the course of more than two decades, charter school expansion resulted in a significant loss in black-held jobs and a reduction in black political power in several black-majority cities. Black teachers were fired en masse in New Orleans, Washington D.C., and Newark, N.J., decimating the black middle class there.

AD

Hundreds of millions of dollars directed towards electing pro-charter candidates ultimately empowered Republicans in many states. The pro-charter group Students First realized that its funding of Republican candidates had backfired. The association of the charter cause with the Republic party lead to the defeat of pro-charter proposals. Democratic voters showed they will not support movements that bolster the Republican Party — the same party that refuses to check Trump’s blatant racism. Democrats who support the idea of charter schools should make it clear to Republicans that they will not tolerate a charter system that offers improved academic performance for some black students only by harming the communities in which those students live.

However, Democrat reformers developed a bad habit of accepting this Faustian bargain, and staying silent in red states on issues like jail expansion, cuts to higher education and attacks on organized labor because dissent ran the risk of slowing the proliferation of charters. Yes, black families want and need choice, but the current charter school movement is too tightly braided with Republican causes; a defense of one is a defense of the other.

AD

To embrace charter schools in 2020 is to embrace Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump and other Republicans who stand to gain more politically from charter support than black communities have gained in jobs and educational benefits. Black kids lose when Democratic educational reformers act like Republicans.

AD

The black community is split on charter schools, which have a 46 percent approval rating among black and brown parents, according to a poll conducted by the pro-reform magazine EducationNext. Maybe black people are divided because black leaders are too. For years black charter leaders have battled for support from a philanthropic apparatus that favored their white peers.

The funders of charter schools continuously put black parents and teachers in the position of fighting against their own interests. White-led philanthropy and education groups will eventually abandon public policy experiments when it is no longer popular, politically expedient or, in some cases, lucrative. For-profit charters are in education ostensibly for the money.

AD

Some black charter leaders feel they must defend the schools because black children attend them. But we don’t need to fall into that trap. We can defend black children and workers without defending charter schools. Black people need systemic change. We can’t allow the cry for charters to drown out the demands for school financing reform, better work conditions, higher teacher pay, universal pre-K, free college, teachers’ training and recruitment programs, stronger labor protections and workforce housing initiatives.

AD

The fight for charters is not about self-determination; it’s clearly about the sector’s survival. If we are going to bat for something, it should be something that gives us a lot more than a slow walk to first base.

We must stop cleaning up the political messes the charter school sector has created for Democrats and black communities. Black charter leaders certainly have a role to play in this election: They should continue to defend black lives. This time, let the charter lobby deal — on its own — with the mess it has made.

Moreover, she was friends with Biden’s deceased son Beau, a fellow state attorney general. One cannot help but think picking her as a running mate would strike a deep emotional cord with Biden.

Harris is one of those potential VP contenders who would help virtually any candidate — and not simply because the serious contenders who remain are all white and she is an African American woman. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could use someone older, with inside-the-Beltway experience and a record on civil rights that would reassure many nonwhite voters. If she is on the ticket with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), she provides some appeal for progressives; on a ticket with the super-progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), she becomes the more moderate vice president, someone with appeal outside the niche of white, New England progressives.

In one sense, Harris’s perceived fuzziness on issues during her own campaign becomes a plus as a vice president who can easily adopt the positions of the top of the ticket. Her own policy positions are not set in stone and are therefore not likely to clash with a running mate.

Sure, Harris’s campaign failed, but few would argue that she lacked political skills, charisma, smarts and media prowess. As a vice presidential nominee, she would not be running the campaign; she would be on one that successfully navigated through a crowded field.

There is one more interesting scenario in which she may play a significant role. This cycle really is the one in which there is a reasonable chance no candidate will get a majority in the primaries, setting up a convention fight. Who wouldn’t want to have on his or her side someone part of the largest delegation (California), someone who racked up endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus and someone who can deliver a boffo political speech in a big arena?

There will be plenty of other VP contenders, including the rest of the nonwinning presidential candidates, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, both New Hampshire female U.S. senators (Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan) and female governors Gretchen Whitmer (Mich.), Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.) and Laura Kelly (Kan.), all three of whom were elected in 2018. Nevertheless, if you want to start handicapping the vice presidential pick, Harris probably should be at the top of the list.

ALLENDALE, S, C. — The Democrats in South Carolina's bluest county had laid out the welcome mat for Pete Buttigieg: a crowded headquarters, a soul food buffet, and praise for being the first 2020 Democrat to visit.

The next thing the South Bend, Ind., mayor got was skepticism.

“I hear a lot about how you don't have support from African Americans,” said Willa Jennings, the county Democratic chair. She turned to Sharon McBride, a black member of South Bend's city council who'd come to campaign with Buttigieg. “Could you tell us some of the things that Mayor Pete has done in South Bend to benefit the citizens in your city?”

It wasn't comfortable. It wasn't supposed to be. Buttigieg, who has surged in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire thanks to support from college-educated white voters, had put together a sort of Southern humility tour. A candidate breaking crowd-count records in small, white towns was holding small meet-and-greets in nonwhite ones.

“I know a lot of African American voters have felt not only kicked around by the Republican Party, but sometimes taken for granted by the Democratic Party that knows how to come to church just before an election but doesn't always come back and engage the community when it's most needed,” he explained. “I know that as somebody who's new on the scene, I've got to earn that trust.”

Sometimes he linked his life as a gay man and son of an immigrant to the experience of nonwhite voters. Sometimes, more self-effacingly, he admitted what he didn't know. In Allendale, where McBride called it a “myth” that Buttigieg had problems with black voters back home, Buttigieg said he was working to connect his own experience to theirs, if he only got the time.

“It's so important to me to earn the support of black voters,” Buttigieg said. “Now, if you were the last poll that came out, I think there were two candidates who had double-digit support among black voters. All the rest of us were in [single digits]. But I don't think that's permanent.”

That was a reference to a national Quinnipiac poll, which had shown Buttigieg surging to 23 percent with white voters, a lead, while winning just 4 percent of black voters. No other candidate polling in double digits overall had such a large racial support gap. His weakness with nonwhite voters has become a punchline from “Saturday Night Live” (“My supporters are a diverse coalition from young to old, gay to straight, white to eggshell”) to the Onion (“Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote”). And racial justice activists had piled on, with a protest breaking out at a pro-Buttigieg event in South Bend, and four immigrant rights groups demanding that he give back any donations from McKinsey employees after revelations about the consulting firm's work on deportation.

Buttigieg's monochrome appeal has made the campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden (the two candidates with double-digit support from black voters in that Quinnipiac poll) happier about his rise in Iowa. In their view, the mayor could kneecap Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has made some inroads with black and Latino voters and take over her “lane” with well-educated white voters, only to get pushed out in Nevada and South Carolina. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, one of the state's most prominent black politicians — the kind of pol, an ambitious mayor of a mid-sized city, who has gotten behind the mayor in other states — endorsed Mike Bloomberg days before Buttigieg's latest trip began. Even this week, as Buttigieg went on the air with a $2 million ad buy, supporters of Biden and Sanders dismissed his chances.

“He's a nonstarter; he's not going to scratch,” said Dick Harpootlian, a state senator and Biden supporter. “This is a guy who's been the mayor of a town not even as big as Columbia, who's got tremendous issues with race relations, who's abandoned his city to run for president. He's not got any sort of civil rights record that would engage African American voters. He's too young and too white.”

The mayor's low-key Southern tour put all of his troubles on display, as well as the different ways he has tried to tackle them — sometimes admitting his blind spots, sometimes sounding too eager to link his relatively privileged life to black and brown struggles.

On Sunday, after attending a service at the Rev. William Barber's church in North Carolina, Buttigieg admitted that he “worked for years under the illusion that our schools in my city were integrated because they had to be, because of a court order.” On Tuesday, at a roundtable with Latino voters, he mentioned that his own father came to America in the 1970s under the “lawful immigration process.” But the experience of a first-generation Maltese American didn't really resonate in the room.

“Part of the bigger issue that is affecting our communities is really that fear in trusting someone again, right?” said Fernando Soto, a DACA recipient and immigrant rights activist from Charleston. (He'd attended a previous meet-and-greet with Biden.) “The Latino community is very, very loyal. But we've been burned many times. And with the Obama administration, I would say that we were tokenized in order for that election to be won.”

Soto wanted Buttigieg to promise an immigration solution in his first term, which Buttigieg did before returning to his overall theory of politics. “If this White House really wanted to resolve immigration issues, they could do it; there's a bipartisan consensus, and then they could claim credit for the achievement,” Buttigieg said. “But they've made a decision not to. And I think that shows that the division is more useful to them than the issue. For my White House, the reverse would be true. We are depending on a more unified country.”

Without Biden's long record in the state, or Sanders's civil rights history, or Warren's detailed critique of discrimination, Buttigieg was often asking voters to see his sincerity. In Allendale and at the Latino forum in Okatie, voters most impressed by Buttigieg cited his military service as evidence that he understood nonwhite voters.

“When you sign up you meet people from all kinds of different backgrounds,” said Gustavo Gomez, 47, a Marine veteran, who’d asked Buttigieg about Puerto Rican representation in Congress. (Buttigieg favored changing that “sooner rather than later,” which Gomez appreciated.) “That helps you govern better.”

On Monday afternoon, Buttigieg took a tour of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, solemnly visiting a memorial to students killed in 1968 when protesting a segregated bowling alley, then bowling a round at the alley on campus — eight pins, then a strike. Two dozen students stopped by for free pizza and conversations, appreciating that Buttigieg would spend the time with them.

“He just did an endorsement video for my Instagram,” said Kayla Hasty, 21, who was running in a contest to pick the top 10 “kings and queens” of historically black colleges and universities. “You don't see many politicians doing that.” She remained undecided.

Charles C. Patton, Hasty's running mate, was in some ways less impressed. Buttigieg was not connecting with black voters, he said, when he linked his own life to the civil rights struggle. As a queer man, Patton found Buttigieg most compelling when he talked about LGBTQ rights, a subject he clearly knew inside out.

“I was happy to hear that he knows what's going on in our community, with black trans women, with LGBTQ youth, with homelessness,” said Patton. “That mattered to me. I like him. He's cool. I love his policies, but sometimes people don't have real awareness of how it affects people, and he has that.”

It was as strong a connection as Buttigieg had all day. After their conversation, Patton was considering a vote for Buttigieg — or Biden, or Warren.

DEBATE SEASON

There are just seven days left for Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to make the sixth Democratic debate. It’s not likely to happen.

To climb onto the Los Angeles debate stage, Booker would need to hit 4 percent in four polls, or 6 percent in two polls of the early-voting states. There may not be enough polls in the field right now, even if Booker were experiencing a dramatic surge in support. Which he isn’t.

That was the backdrop for Booker's Thursday morning speech in Iowa, a late edition to his schedule in the wake of Sen. Kamala D. Harris's exit from the presidential race, where he argued outright that nervous donors and shortsighted debate rules were bleaching the primary before voters got to pick their candidate.

“People in Iowa, people in New Hampshire, people in Nevada, people in South Carolina should determine this race. Not how much [money] is being poured in,” Booker said. “This isn't about an individual candidate, as much as I am hurt, my family members hurt, as much as people are frustrated about Kamala’s story. Kamala was never in it for herself. She knew this was a bigger story. This is not about one candidate. It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.”

Booker returned again and again to Harris, whose campaign had collapsed in Iowa, but who had been drawing bigger crowds, more endorsements, and more volunteers than the wealthy candidates who'd plunged into the race.

“She had this campaign that spoke to the aspirations of our country,” Booker said. “Here is a black woman, an Asian woman who broke barriers at every point of her campaign, and won in our largest state: 40-plus million people. She's lived her whole life dedicated to public service. I get to sit with her in the Judiciary Committee, I see who she is and I just want to say from my heart, it is a problem when an immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters, didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa.”

It was a dramatic moment for Booker, who had been making this case again and again in the hours since Harris's campaign ended. Harris had qualified for the December debate, making her an inconvenient martyr for this cause. But her exit gave new urgency to an argument former HUD secretary Julián Castro had been making when he missed the November debate: The party was silencing several credible nonwhite candidates.

That argument has helped Castro, who has no path back to the stage under current rules, raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, keeping his low-overhead campaign afloat. It has found a guilty conscience in Tom Steyer, the billionaire whose omnipresent TV ads have helped him qualify for the debates.

“I’m calling on the DNC to open up the debate requirements for January so that more candidates can participate,” Steyer said in a statement. “In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country, and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee.”

Steyer was pushing on an open door; DNC Chairman Tom Perez told The Post last month that the DNC would revisit its debate rules in January. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said that the party had created “the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires,” and that Democrats were “proud of this historic and diverse field,” as showcased in most of the debates so far.

“While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process,” Hinojosa said. “Nobody who has failed to reach 4 percent at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Joe Biden, “Laughed At.” A pool camera covering a Buckingham Palace reception for NATO members captured Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau making fun of President Trump. Within 24 hours, Biden's campaign put it into an ad that focuses on the theme of his recent campaign spots: that Trump is embarrassing the country and the former vice president could restore its image. Three of Biden's last four commercials hit the same notes (and even the same imagery, of Biden walking alongside Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel), but this one went viral quickly, helped by audio clips of TV hosts discussing how little respect Trump commanded.

Elizabeth Warren, “Wealth Tax.” The senator from Massachusetts has spent less on TV than anyone else polling in double digits, and her campaign plunked down less than $1,000 to run this spot, in conjunction with her Bloomberg TV interview. It's her second time with this gimmick; previously, she bought time on CNBC to highlight criticism of the wealth tax from some of the network's wealthy guests.

Tom Steyer, “Save the World, Do It Together.” The billionaire candidate's march through early-state TV screens continues with a first: a subtle argument with another candidate. In the spot, Steyer asks a rhetorical question: “How are we going to pull this country together?” He answers it by talking about climate change. “We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world and do it together. You think that’d pull America together? I do.” It's a response to the message that has done well for Buttigieg recently, that the post-Trump president's first job will be reuniting Americans, something he doesn't tie to a particular issue.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (UC Berkeley, 1,694 California voters)

Bernie Sanders: 24% ( 5)

Elizabeth Warren: 22% (-7)

Joe Biden: 14% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg: 12% ( 6)

Kamala Harris: 7% (-1)

Andrew Yang: 3% ( 1)

Amy Klobuchar: 3% ( 1)

Mike Bloomberg: 2% ( 2)

This may be the final poll to offer Kamala Harris's name for voters, and a sub-question found that 61 percent of California Democrats thought she should leave the race. It's also Sanders's first good poll in the state for some time, though Harris's departure ameliorates the bad news for Warren: She was the most popular second choice for voters who had been sticking with the race's second-highest-profile female candidate. And she's in a better position than Biden, who trails Sanders with Latino voters and gets pummeled with young voters: By a landslide, voters under 30 stick with Sanders. Biden's strength with nonwhite Democrats, the basis of his lead in Southern primaries, is harder to find in delegate-rich California.

IN THE STATES

Florida. Andrew Gillum, last year's unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor, will become the chairman of iVote's board, following a year of voting rights advocacy and voter registration campaigns in his home state.

Georgia. Five-term Rep. Tom Graves will retire next year, a surprise for Republicans who saw a long future for their 49-year-old colleague. Graves's 14th District, which covered northwest Georgia, is safely Republican and backed the president by 53 points in 2016.

Washington. Four-term Rep. Denny Heck is leaving his relatively safe Democratic seat around Tacoma, explaining in a letter that the Republican response to the Trump presidency had wearied him: “Will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.” Trump lost Heck's 10th Congressional District by 13 points, making it a reach for Republicans in a state Democrats expect to easily win.

2020

Joe Biden. He got one of the biggest endorsements in the Democratic Party on Thursday, with former secretary of state and 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry getting behind his campaign. Kerry, who's three years younger than Biden, had been fitfully discussed as a 2020 candidate but made no moves toward a run. He'll campaign with the former vice president this weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Pete Buttigieg. He won endorsements from three lower-profile members of the Obama team: the president's personal aide Reggie Love, former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Austan Goolsbee, and former White House Office of Health Reform communications director Linda Douglass.

Bernie Sanders. He picked up the support of the Iowa CCI Action Fund, a liberal group in the state that had supported him in 2016 and worked with him in his campaigns.

Mike Bloomberg. In Aurora, Colo., the site of a 2013 mass shooting, he proposed a new gun control system that would include not just background checks but federal licensing, a bugaboo of gun rights activists.

Cory Booker. United We Win, the new super PAC that had bought an ad contrasting Booker with Buttigieg, announced $500,000 in new spending designed to help him enter the December debate. One example: a bus ad showing Booker next to Bloomberg and Steyer, with the legend, “We need diversity, not more billionaires.”

MEET A PAC

THE PAC: 1820 PAC

PARTY: Republican

FOCUS: Providing air cover for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, running ads that pitch her as a moderate who the Senate could not afford to lose.

BUDGET: It has paid for $400,000 of ads so far, and as of summer, it had raised $776,000 from wealthy donors, most of it from Blackstone Group chief executive Stephen Schwartzman.

PLAN: The group's first ad emphasizes ways in which Collins has broke with Republicans and the Trump administration. “When the big drug companies were gouging patients, Susan took them on and wrote a law to lower drug prices,” a narrator says. “When extremists in both parties shut down the government, Susan Collins led the bipartisan effort to end the stalemate.”

EFFECTIVENESS: It's on brand for Collins, whose campaign, like others that have expected super PACs to help them, had already uploaded b-roll footage for curious ad-makers. (Campaigns cannot coordinate with super PACs, but nothing prevents them releasing a few soundless clips of candidates meeting voters in factories.)

WHAT I'M WATCHING

NARAL's big 2020 bet. The abortion rights group is planning its biggest-ever political investment next year, spending $34.7 million to turn out 3.6 million voters in eight states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina.

“We think abortion is central to the election, and it should be central,” said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. “It’s an issue Democrats can and do win on. The energy of the base on this is off the charts, because of the abortion bans we’ve seen in the states.”

NARAL's target states include a few of the Democrats' must-wins in the electoral college and a few the group sees as crucial for Senate math: Georgia and Iowa. (There are Senate races in all eight states, and Michigan and Minnesota have Democratic incumbents.)

The focus of the campaign, a combination of ads and organizing, will be “reminding people of what their senator has done and what Trump has led,” said Hogue. That included the “extraordinary overreach of judges,” the appointment of antiabortion judges who most of the targeted senators voted for (Collins was an occasional exception), and the passage or introduction of “dangerous medically inaccurate legislation” in the states.

That messaging, Hogue said, would activate three kinds of voters: the Democrats' base, lower-propensity voters who lean toward Democrats (and sat out some recent elections), and “soft partisan” women who've voted Republican before but bolted the party over abortion rights. Virginia, where Republicans tried and failed to turn legislation to loosen abortion restrictions into an election issue this year, was the proof of concept.

Hogue, who helped amend the Democrats' 2016 platform to make it more supportive of abortion rights, said that NARAL had advantages that didn't exist then.

“We were warning people that Trump said women should be punished for abortion, and that he’d appoint only pro-life judges,” Hogue said. “But there was a combination of people saying, 'Oh, he only says that to be elected,' and 'Oh, and that could never happen here.' That’s what’s been so shocking with these state laws, and that's why they're central to the campaign.”

He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump,” the report continued. “His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.”

Biden has survived and is now more critical of his rivals, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) who he claims never got the scrutiny she deserved for her Medicare-for-all plan. (He might have added that she has not gotten many queries about her subsequent retreat from Medicare-for-all, either.) He has a few things going for him now that the candidates have dwindled.

First, no one in Iowa can honestly doubt who he is and what he stands for. He was never for Medicare-for-all; he wants to build on the Affordable Care Act. He is not an America First or an America Retreat proponent. Reporters talk a lot about authenticity but do not seem to grasp that, for many voters, all those gaffes and strange verbal journeys show how different he is from his opponents. He does not need to introduce himself to the African American community. He is comfortable in his own skin (maybe too comfortable?), which voters can sense. Even if they don’t love him, they trust him.

Second, Biden sure has lowered expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire. That is the flip side of losing one’s lead. He does not have to win or even come in second to keep going. Staying ahead of one or more of his rivals in these first two races likely will be good enough to keep him in the race through Super Tuesday when his national name recognition and support among nonwhite voters will pay off.

Finally, as Trump destroys one government institution after another, sending career civil servants into retirement and deforming the mission of Cabinet departments (Does anyone think the Environmental Protection Agency is looking out for your health and well-being?), it might dawn on voters that the next president will find the federal government in utter disarray. It surely is the case that the next president will have to rebuild our reputation internationally.

His recent ad makes the persuasive argument that it would be nice if foreign leaders didn’t laugh at the U.S. president:

The world is laughing at President Trump. They see him for what he really is: dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.

Under such circumstances, perhaps someone who knows everyone and every nook and cranny of government and every world leader would be useful.

This is not to say that Biden is the “front-runner,” but he has as good a chance as anyone to win the nomination. He and his team have figured out that Twitter and the rest of social media, not to mention national media outlets’ snarky 30-something reporters, don’t represent America. You would be foolish to count him out.

A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white.

Democratic contenders who kicked off their campaigns promising to break gender barriers, or rally the rainbow coalition of Barack Obama, instead found themselves fighting concerns that the country’s lingering racism or sexism could help reelect Trump.

AD

“I do think this is a real moment of reckoning in the party,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign who now works for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, most of whose members are immigrants or women of color. “We had the most diverse field in history, and there is an argument that was soundly rejected by voters.”

AD

To a striking degree, Democratic voters appear to be adopting the role of pundits, choosing candidates based on how they believe other voters will act rather than their own preferences, interviews with voters shows.

Still, the nomination is far from settled. Obama trailed Clinton in the polls in late 2007 before going on to win the nomination, and past nominees such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004 came back from polling deficits the preceding fall. But neither of those candidates was excluded from the party’s debates because of low polling, a prospect that has hit some women and nonwhite candidates particularly hard this year.

AD

Currently, six white candidates, including two women and billionaire financier Tom Steyer, have qualified for the December debate. Two others, businessman Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are of Asian descent, need one more poll at 4 percent to qualify. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who is black, and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, who is Latino, are not likely to make the cut. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black and who entered the race last month, also is not expected to make the stage.

AD

“We have more billionaires onstage than black people,” said former South Carolina state representative Bakari Sellers, who had endorsed Harris. “The Republican top six candidates at this time in 2016 was more diverse than our top six candidates.”

The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black.

AD

Sellers cautioned against buying into fears that Trump would more easily beat a minority candidate. “Trump is an interesting phenomenon: He has actually put the Democratic Party in what I feel is an untenable position by believing we need a white candidate to win,” he said.

Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who had endorsed Harris, said journalists and others were disproportionately critical of the senator’s campaign.

AD

“I think we as a party give lip service to diversity, but we really care very little about it,” Fudge said. “I would say for the highest-ranking elected black woman in the country to have gotten the kind of dismissal by so many people, I think is nothing more than misogynistic, as well as in some respects quite racist.”

AD

Strategists and candidates blame the struggles of female and minority candidates on a variety of factors. The initial fury of the women’s marches that greeted Trump’s arrival in Washington has faded, they say. Individual weaknesses were shown by candidates like Harris, who struggled to articulate a consistent campaign message, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), who ran an unabashed women-focused campaign that failed to connect with voters.

Others point to media coverage that they say focused on white working-class male voters and suggested the party’s overriding challenge was to win them back. Candidates like Harris, Castro and Booker, in contrast, have run explicitly on their promise to turn out more urban voters in the general election.

AD

“There is a narrative that has developed in the media about who can best take on Donald Trump, about this moderate working-class white voter in the Midwest,” Castro said in an interview. “I don’t recall any articles that have spent nearly as much time figuring out what happened with the decline in the black vote, looking at Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia.”

AD

The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.

“You do hear over and over again from women in focus groups, ‘I would like to see a female president, but I think it would be harder for a woman to win,’ ” said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private surveys. “People are projecting who people will vote for, who they think will win.”

AD

Some Democratic candidates have directly addressed such fears. Both Castro and Booker have regularly urged Democrats to avoid defaulting to a “safe” choice.

AD

“People have been traumatized by a president who often sounds more like George Wallace than we would hope would sound like George Washington,” Booker said in an interview.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has leaned into her history-making quality as potentially the first female president, has made calls for dreaming big and doing hard things a central part of her message. And at the last Democratic debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) tried to dispel doubts that a woman could take on Trump.

“Women are held to a higher standard — otherwise we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Female President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men,” Klobuchar said. She cited the example of the House speaker. “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,” she said.

Karen Finney, a strategist who worked on Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said the recent gains by women and minorities, including the election of Obama and the nomination of Clinton, do not erase the head winds faced by such candidates.

“There is still cultural bias, frankly,” Finney said. “Some of it is unconscious. There is a sexism and some racism about what a leader looks like and who we think can win.”

In public polls, voters give conflicting signals about their association of race and sex with electability. A June Los Angeles Times/USC survey found that when Democratic voters were asked to describe the characteristics of a nominee with the best chance of beating Trump, 68 percent said that imaginary candidate would be white and 70 percent said the person would be a man.

On the other hand, a September Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly 8 in 10 saying a candidate’s race did not matter in his or her ability to defeat Trump, while nearly 7 in 10 said the same about gender.

AD

Booker and Castro have argued that rules of the nominating process have contributed to the struggles of nonwhite candidates. Castro points to the enormous influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, two overwhelmingly white states, on selecting the nominee.

Booker blames the rules for qualifying for the Democratic debates, established by party Chair Tom Perez, which emphasize polls and grass-roots fundraising. Such guidelines favor candidates with a narrow appeal, Booker says, and force campaigns to shift focus away from their field programs to raise more money.

Perez allowed 20 candidates to attend the first debates, and he has been gradually winnowing the stage. All the networks hosting debates are required by the party to have nonwhite and female representation among the moderators.

Booker argued that for the January debate, the qualifications should be changed to include endorsements in Iowa and other factors like whether a candidate is considered a second or third choice in the state.

“It is unacceptable that there is a true competition in Iowa that you will not get to see right before their caucus,” Booker said. “That incongruence is unacceptable.” The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3.

Another obstacle for nonwhite candidates has been the staying power of former vice president Joe Biden. He received 27 percent support from Democratic-leaning voters overall in a late October Washington Post-ABC News poll, but 30 percent support among nonwhites and 39 percent support among blacks. Those numbers may shift if he fails to perform well in the early contests in states such as Iowa, where he is polling lower.

Charles Lewis, chairman of the Greenwood County Democratic Party in South Carolina, said many voters in the first Southern state to cast its primary vote feel safer with Biden’s profile.

“I think because he is, of all things, an older white man and this is the South,” said Lewis, who is African American. “People think they rolled the dice on Obama, but now let’s be safe this time and let’s get something done.”"

THE BIG IDEA: After the 8 1/2-hour impeachment inquiry hearing wrapped up last night, Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) joined the other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee for a news conference. “All I got to say is: If you love America, mamas, don't let your babies grow up to go to Harvard or Stanford law school,” Gohmert said.

Constitutional scholars from those two institutions, invited to testify by the Democrats, had just finished laying out arguments for why President Trump’s conduct warrants impeachment.

Gohmert’s quip was a play on the country song popularized by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in 1978: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. … Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.”

It was a fitting coda to a day that showcased a virulent strain of anti-elitism, even anti-intellectualism, that has flared up as Trump hijacked the GOP from the establishmentarians who once called the shots.

Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, set the tone in his opening statement. “America will see why most people don’t go to law school,” he declared. “No offense to our professors. But please. Really? We’re bringing you in here today to testify on stuff … that we already know, out of the classrooms that maybe you're getting ready for finals in, to discuss things that you probably haven't even had a chance to [read or watch].”

Collins, who just got passed over for a Senate appointment despite Trump pressuring the governor of Georgia to pick him, pooh-poohed a sober-minded discussion about when the Founding Fathers thought impeachment would be advisable as “esoteric.”

Paul Taylor, the chief counsel for Republicans on the committee, suggested as he began questioning the four witnesses that the legal profession as a whole is somehow controlled by the left. He claimed at the start of his questioning – without any citations – that 97 percent of campaign contributions from lawyers during the 2016 presidential campaign went to Hillary Clinton while Trump received only 3 percent. “And the situation is essentially the same at law schools around the country, including those represented on the panel here today,” Taylor said.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who told reporters at the start of the day how much he disliked attending lectures in law school, told Stanford Law School Professor Pamela Karlan that she was unable to see from “the ivory towers of your law school” how condescending she was being to “actual people in this country.”

And so it went.

-- The attacks on law schools and the legal profession in general reflect the broader focus on process and style over substance in Trump’s defense strategy. There is little dispute about the underlying facts of the case, even as a growing body of evidence directly ties Trump to an alleged conspiracy to coerce the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into a 2020 challenger, former vice president Joe Biden, in exchange for transferring nearly $400 million of military aid, which Congress had already approved, and scheduling a coveted meeting with a neophyte president who was desperate to project strength in the face of an ongoing Russian occupation in his country.

-- Marginalizing experts and debasing expertise have been hallmarks of the Trump presidency. Trump doesn’t just reject climate science. His administration has suppressed research. He’s purged nonpartisan experts from an array of government agencies. He still refuses to accept the consensus of the professionals in the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy.

The manager of Trump’s reelection campaign, Brad Parscale, referred to the scholars invited by Democrats to testify as “the Three Stooges” on Twitter. “Just more of the same old sham!” he wrote.

-- The criticism of the professional class offers another proof point to illustrate why so many white-collar suburbanites who have traditionally supported Republicans have defected during the Trump era. But Trump has proven to also be a magnet for non-college-educated whites in the Rust Belt who are ancestrally Democratic, accelerating a once-in-a-generation realignment.

-- Karlan replied forcefully to Collins’s suggestion that she knew not of what she spoke. “I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts. I’m insulted by the suggestion that, as a law professor, I don’t care about the facts,” Karlan said. “I spent all of Thanksgiving vacation sitting there, reading these transcripts. … I ate, like, a turkey that came to us in the mail that was already cooked because I was spending my time doing this.”

-- Rank-and-file Republicans have soured considerably on the value of colleges and universities in recent years. A Pew Research Center study published in August showed that only 33 percent of Republicans see value in higher education, down from 53 percent in 2012. “Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) say professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom is a major reason why the higher education system is headed in the wrong direction (only 17% of Democrats say the same),” according to Pew. “And three-quarters of Republicans (vs. 31% of Democrats) point to too much concern about protecting students from views they might find offensive as a major reason for their views.”

-- The criticism of the legal profession came even though 15 of the 17 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee hold law degrees. Overall, 161 House members and 53 senators earned juris doctorates, according to the Congressional Research Service.

-- House Democrats signaled there will be at least one article of impeachment related to the 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller’s report. “President Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election. He demanded it for the 2020 election. In both cases, he got caught,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

-- University of North Carolina Law Professor Michael Gerhardt, one of the witnesses, testified that an obstruction case against Trump is a slam dunk, citing the administration’s stated refusal to comply with any subpoenas for documents and depositions. “In our law schools, we would teach our students this is an easy, straightforward situation,” he said.

Gerhardt also argued that what Trump asked of the Ukrainians is impeachable, as well. “I just want to stress that if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" he said. “This is precisely the misconduct that the Framers created a Constitution including impeachment to protect against. … If we cannot impeach a president who uses his power for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy.”

-- Even the witness that Republicans invited to testify, George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley, said that Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “anything but perfect.” But Turley argued that it’s not impeachable and accused Democrats of rushing to impeach without the testimony of key witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo – who are refusing, at Trump’s direction, to appear.“If you rush this impeachment, you’re going to leave half the country behind,” he said.He later called the Democratic case “not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous.”

-- “Impeachment goes to college” is how Dan Zak and Ben Terris framed the hearing in their write-up for the Style section: “After last month’s testimony from bow-tied diplomats and stone-faced bureaucrats — ‘fact witnesses’ who actually saw or heard Trump’s inciting behavior — the impeachment process has reached the peer-review phase. During this hearing, professors referenced a 1640 sermon by John Winthrop and a 1792 edition of Samuel Johnson’s dictionary. There were multiple odes to forgotten founder William Richardson Davie, the onetime governor of North Carolina who argued fiercely for an impeachment provision in drafts of the Constitution. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) had in front of him a tattered college copy of the Federalist Papers, scrawled with marginalia.”

-- When he got a chance to question Karlan, Gaetz noted that the professor has given campaign contributions to Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He asked her about a comment she made on a podcast that suggested liberals cluster in tighter communities while conservatives tend to spread out. “Do you understand how that reflects contempt on people who are conservative?” Gaetz asked. “No, what I was talking about there was the natural tendency -- if you put the quote in context – the natural tendency of a compactness requirement to favor a party whose voters are more spread out,” she answered. “I do not have contempt for conservatives.”

Karlan later apologized for “getting a little overheated.” She also apologized for quipping earlier in the day that “the president can name his son Barron,” but he can’t make him a baron. “It was wrong of me to do that,” she said, after Republicans attacked her. “I wish the president would apologize, obviously, for the things that he's done that are wrong, but I do regret having said that.”

“That does not lend credibility to your argument,” Gaetz told her. “It makes you look mean.”

-- One Republican on the committee also floated a new defense of the president: Everybody does it. Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said that basically every president could have been impeached under the standards cited by Democrats for abuse of power. “When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he was president, directed the IRS to conduct audits of his political enemies ... would that be impeachable conduct?” Buck asked Turley. “How about when President Kennedy directed his brother, Robert Kennedy, to deport one of his mistresses as an East German spy?”

“Turley said he couldn’t rule it out, nor could he do so when Buck asked about allegations that President Lyndon Johnson used the CIA to plant a spy in the campaign of his 1964 Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater,” Mike DeBonis notes. “Buck ultimately landed on Obama, pointing to his interpretation of the recess appointments power that was later rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court, as well as his response to the 2012 Benghazi attack.”

“Can you name a single president in the history of the United States — save President [William Henry] Harrison, who died 32 days after his inauguration — that would not have met the standard of impeachment for our friends here?” Buck asked.

“I would hope to God James Madison would escape,” said Turley, who has written about Madison. “Otherwise, a lifetime of academic work would be shredded. But once again, I can’t exclude many of these acts.”

Buck reasoned that, if Democrats impeach Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine, Republicans will impeach the next Democratic president if they have control of the House because the concept of what’s in the “national interest” is so open for debate.

“Some people live in an ivory tower and some people live in a swamp,” Buck said. “And those of us that are in the swamp are doing our very best for the American people, but it’s not pretty.”

“Well, actually, I live in an ivory tower in a swamp because I'm at G.W.,” Turley replied. “But it's not so bad.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a brief speech this morning that she’s asked House committee chairs to proceed with articles of impeachment, saying lawmakers have “no choice but to act.” “The president has engaged in abuse of power undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections,” she said. “His actions are in defiance of the vision of our founders and the oath of office that he takes to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our Founders and our heart full of love for America, today I’m asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.” She didn’t give any indication of how quickly the process would move.

-- Attorney General Bill Barr’s handpicked prosecutor, John Durham, told Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that he can’t back up the right-wing conspiracy theory that the Russia investigation was a setup by American intelligence. Horowitz’s office contacted Durham, “the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett scoop. “The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign … But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets … And Durham informed Horowitz’s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general’s findings on that point. … That could rebut conservatives’ doubts — which Barr has shared with associates in recent weeks — that Horowitz might be blessing the FBI’s Russia investigation prematurely and that Durham could potentially find more, particularly with regard to the Maltese professor.”

-- Rudy Giuliani, trying to poke holes in the case against his client, is in Kyiv and Budapest this week to talk with former Ukrainian prosecutors. From the Times’ Ken Vogel and Benjamin Novak: “Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk … Mr. Giuliani is using the trip … to help prepare more episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative. His latest moves to advance the theories propounded by the prosecutors amount to an audacious effort to give the president’s supporters new material to undercut the House impeachment proceedings and an eventual Senate trial.”

-- The White House is preparing for an aggressive effort to defend Trump in the Senate. Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian report: “Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs, told reporters that Trump ‘wants his case made fully in the Senate,’ previewing a strategy that would include live witnesses on the floor, rather than videotaped depositions that were entered into evidence during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999. … Ueland was among a quartet of top White House officials, including Counsel Pat Cipollone, who met with GOP senators on Wednesday as the administration continues to strategize with Republicans on the Senate proceedings. The private session … underscored the extent to which Trump has largely blown off the House inquiry and is focusing on a likely trial in the GOP-controlled Senate, where the White House says he would get a fair defense and can easily win an acquittal.”

-- But Trump opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee’s first hearing, unlike Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. Paul Kane reports: “Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump’s side.”

-- Joe Biden said he would not voluntarily appear as a witness in a Senate impeachment trial if called to testify. Colby Itkowitz reports: “‘No, I’m not going to let them take their eye off the ball,’ Biden said [in Iowa]. … ‘The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes. And I’m not going to let them divert from that, I’m not going to let anyone divert from that.’ Biden added that he’d released 21 years of his tax returns, so if Trump is worried about corruption, ‘let him release some of his.’”

-- Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) announced he will not seek reelection. From Politico: “Heck, 67, was first elected in 2012 to represent a [solidly blue] district southwest of Seattle. He said in a Medium post he had time over the Thanksgiving recess for ‘rest and reflection,’ which led to his retirement decision. … Heck also wrote that the process of compiling the intelligence committee's recent impeachment report had left him ‘discouraged’ about continuing to serve in Congress. ‘The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary,’ Heck wrote. ‘I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.’”

Sandra Diaz, a former employee of the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster and an undocumented immigrant, poses for a portrait at home in Bound Brook, N.J. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Undocumented workers who served Trump recall his habits and outbursts: Joshua Partlow and Dave Fahrenthold have interviewed 48 people this year who worked illegally for the Trump Organization at 11 of its properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Virginia: “They have seen poolside tantrums and holiday arguments. They’ve laughed with the in-laws and watched after the grandkids. Their recollections also show how Trump’s entrance into presidential politics — denouncing illegal immigrants as criminals and job-stealers — upended their lives and prompted some of them to publicly confront their former boss.” Here are choice nuggets from their must-read piece:

“It was important for Sandra Diaz to be invisible. Before entering the Trump family villa, she would tie back her hair, pull on latex gloves and step into delicate paper shoe coverings. She knew not to wear makeup or perfume that might leave the faintest trace of her presence. As Donald Trump’s personal housekeeper, Diaz was dealing with a fussy celebrity owner who presided like a monarch over the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster long before he was elevated to president. She was an immigrant from Costa Rica working illegally for Trump with a fake Social Security card she had bought for $50. Being invisible was her life’s work. Moving quickly through the two-story house in the mornings, Diaz carried out Trump’s fastidious instructions. In his closet, she would hang six sets of identical golf outfits: six white polo shirts, six pairs of beige pants, six neatly ironed pairs of boxer shorts. …

“Those who cooked and served Trump knew that he liked … his Diet Coke in small glass bottles with a plastic straw that no one could be seen touching. Trump loved Tic Tacs. But not an arbitrary amount. He wanted, in his bedroom bureau at all times, two full containers of white Tic Tacs and one container that was half full. The same rule applied to the Bronx Colors-brand face makeup from Switzerland that Trump slathered on — two full containers, one half full — even if it meant the housekeepers had to regularly bring new shirts from the pro shop because of the rust-colored stains on the collars. A special washing machine in the laundry room was reserved for his wife Melania Trump’s clothing. Donald Trump liked Irish Spring bar soap in his shower. But his housekeepers quickly learned not to throw out his soap even if it had worn down to the tiniest sliver: Trump decided when he wanted something discarded. When that happened, with clothes or newspapers, he would toss them on the floor.

“A regular recipient of Trump’s castoff clothing was Melania’s father, Viktor Knavs … ‘They’re the same size and everything,’ [said Victorina Morales, Diaz’s successor as Trump’s housekeeper at Bedminster]. Knavs and his wife, Amalija Knavs, were favorites of the Bedminster staff, even if much was lost in translation from Slovenian to Spanish. … One day in 2013, Viktor Knavs went out to play golf wearing one of Trump’s discarded red baseball caps. When Trump spotted him on the fairway, he blew up, and he ordered his father-in-law, in front of other golfers, to remove the hat and get off the course. … Diaz and Morales were in the villa when Knavs returned, threw the hat on the ground and cursed Trump. The housekeepers pieced together the story from what Amalija Knavs told them in English and what they heard from the caddies who were on the course at the time. ‘Nobody could wear the red hat but [Trump],’ Diaz said.”

-- The Post’s year-long investigation on Trump’s employment of undocumented workers has led to these five additional findings:

At least 11 Trump properties hired undocumented workers, some who said they started working for Trump 17 years ago. Trump said in July he wasn't sure if his company employed undocumented workers. But many former workers said it's hard to believe that the managers didn't know. The Trump Organization didn’t face many legal consequences for using undocumented labor. The workers, however, have lost their jobs and have found it hard to get back on their feet after being fired by the organization. Some have also been ostracized by other undocumented workers who fear that the attention might put them at greater deportation risk. While some of the undocumented workers entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, others arrived on flights with tourist visas that they overstayed. In those cases, Trump’s promised border wall wouldn’t have mattered.

-- A gunman opened fire at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam near Honolulu, killing two and injuring a third before killing himself, base officials said. Reis Thebault and Marisa Iati report: “The shooter was identified as an active-duty U.S. Navy sailor and the three victims as civilian Defense Department employees working on the base’s shipyard. The surviving victim is at a hospital in stable condition, Rear Adm. Robb Chadwick said in a Wednesday evening news conference. The shooter’s motive is still unknown, Chadwick said, and it wasn’t yet clear whether the attack was targeted or random.”

-- Birds are getting smaller, and scientists believe it’s because of global warming. Ben Guarino reports: “So shows an analysis of migratory birds that died after colliding into buildings in Chicago and were collected as specimens for the Field Museum of Natural History. David Willard, a Field Museum ornithologist, has measured the Windy City’s dead birds since 1978. Data from his calipers and scales reveal decades-long trends in bird bodies: Their legs, on average, are growing shorter. They have lost weight. Their wings are getting slightly longer. These changes are present in nearly all of the species he measured, according to a study of 70,716 bird specimens from almost 40 years published Wednesday in the journal Ecology Letters. Morphing birds, Willard and his colleagues say, reflect a changing climate. ‘Warming temperatures seem to be having a pretty consistent and almost universal effect on a large number of different species, regardless of other aspects of their biology,’ said study author Benjamin Winger, who studies the evolution and ecology of birds at the University of Michigan.”

-- The freak storms of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season have left behind a trail of destruction. Matthew Cappucci reports: “Both Dorian and Lorenzo, which became the strongest hurricane to develop so far northeast in the Atlantic, attained Category 5 strength. The storms brought the count of Category 5s in the Atlantic since 2016 up to six, and marked the fourth year in a row with at least one Category 5, the longest stretch on record. The historic intensity of both Dorian and Lorenzo, along with the record-setting rains produced by storms Barry and Imelda in the United States, exhibited influences consistent with warming ocean waters and climate change. … This year had an above-average season. It was only the seventh season since the 1930s to rack up multiple Category 5s over the Atlantic Basin. Across the board, 24 percent more ‘accumulated cyclone energy’ than average was expended by storms this season. It also brought about one of the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfalls on record. But many in the United States view the season as a reprieve for the storm-beleaguered country, noting that only two hurricanes made landfall in the United States this season, along with one tropical storm. Both hurricanes were at Category 1 strength when they did so. The year was still incredibly active; the contiguous United States just got lucky.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Trump administration is considering sending 14,000 more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran. From the Wall Street Journal: “The deployment could double the number of U.S. military personnel who have been sent to the region since the start of a troop buildup in May. [Trump] is expected to make a decision on the new deployments as soon as this month … There is growing fear among U.S. military and other administration officials that an attack on U.S. interests and forces could leave the U.S. with few options in the region ... By sending additional military resources to the region, the administration would be presenting a more credible deterrent to Tehran, which has been blamed for a series of attacks, including one in September against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied involvement.”

-- U.S. intelligence officials believe Iran is secretly moving missiles into Iraq. From the New York Times: “New intelligence about Iran’s stockpiling of missiles in Iraq is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s efforts to deter Tehran by increasing the American military presence in the Middle East has largely failed. The missiles pose a threat to American allies and partners in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and could endanger American troops ... Both Iran and Iraq have been gripped in recent weeks by sometimes violent public protests. In Iraq, some are protesting against Iranian influence.”

-- German authorities said they suspect that Russian agents were behind an execution-style killing in Berlin in the summer and expelled two Russian diplomats in connection with the case. Loveday Morris reports from Berlin and Robyn Dixon reports from Moscow: “The federal public prosecutor said there was ‘sufficient factual evidence’ that the Aug. 23 killing was carried out by Russian intelligence agencies or those of Russia’s Chechen Republic. The German Foreign Ministry declared two employees of the Russian Embassy in Berlin ‘persona non gratae,’ saying that Russian authorities have not cooperated with the investigation ‘sufficiently’ despite repeated ‘high-ranking’ requests. The killing compounds concerns about Russia’s efforts to assassinate political opponents on European soil less than two years after Britain accused Moscow of attacking former Russian agent turned informant Sergei Skripal with nerve agent in Salisbury, England. … [This] would represent the first such slaying on German soil since the end of the Cold War. It threatens to stymie relations between Berlin and Moscow, a fragile bond for Germany, which tries to balance political differences against its energy needs.

“Berlin prosecutors named the victim, who was shot in the head in a central Berlin park, as ‘Tornike K.’ — a 40-year-old Russian-Georgian citizen … Between 2000 and 2004, he commanded a Chechen militia that fought Russian forces during the Russian-Chechen war … The slain man also fought with a Georgian unit defending South Ossetia during the 2008 Georgia-Russia war … He survived a 2015 assassination attempt, despite being shot four times, and later fled to Germany, where he claimed asylum. … [H]e was tailed by a man on an electric bicycle before being shot with a Glock-26 pistol.” This is right out of the Kremlin's playbook.

-- Ukranian and Russian leaders will try to seal a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and agree on prisoner swaps when they meet next week. From Reuters: “With Kiev politically constrained and Moscow unlikely to bend, prospects for peace remain bleak, diplomats said. … Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions. Key to the accords are elections in the disputed eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. But both sides accuse each other of failing to stick to the deal, which includes restoring Ukrainian state control over the entire border with Russia and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the conflict zone.”

-- As the NATO summit concluded, ""Trump abruptly canceled a planned news conference, saying that he had already answered so many questions from reporters in other settings during his visit to Britain. He took off for Washington,"" Michael Birnbaum, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report from London. ""Though his conduct here fit his pattern of disruption at international summits, Trump did not make the fiery threats that have punctuated previous gatherings. NATO leaders were almost giddy as they survived another encounter with Trump with their alliance intact. Trump’s canceled news conference — eliminating one last chance for him to take aim at them — was to many the departure gift.”

-- The British Conservative Party breathed a sigh of relief after Trump left the U.K. without smashing its election strategy. From Politico: “It means [Boris Johnson] survived the Trump visit without any extra obstacles being put in his way ahead of the December 12 vote. … Johnson spent two days working hard to avoid being pictured with Trump, who is deeply unpopular in the U.K. He did not greet the president at the door of Downing Street when world leaders arrived for a reception on Wednesday night. The only photos of Johnson and Trump together were the full NATO group shot and the obligatory opening handshake snap.”

-- France is bracing for massive transportation disruptions starting today as trade unions launch a strike in response to changes Emmanuel Macron wants to make to the country’s retirement system. James McAuley reports: “Much of the Paris Metro will be shut down, as will many national and international train lines, including certain Eurostar services. Flights also will be canceled, as air traffic controllers say they will join the protests through Saturday. Strikes and protests, of course, are a well-known fixture of French life, from the student uprisings of 1968 to the ‘yellow vest’ demonstrations against inequality that stunned the French government last year with their vigor and violence. No other Western democracy seems to have as high a tolerance for burning cars and broken windows. But these protests could be bigger and more destabilizing than most.”

-- Australia is blocking asylum seekers held offshore from seeking medical care in the country. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton claims the policy has helped people migrate into Australia ‘through the back door.’ Physicians and refugee advocates say it has saved sick asylum seekers’ lives. And Wednesday, Australian lawmakers voted narrowly to revoke the policy, in what Doctors Without Borders described as a move that ‘endangers patients in need and ignores the ethical framework of the entire medical profession.’ At least 135 asylum seekers have sought treatment or assessment in Australia since the policy was approved this year. The law required physicians to deem their transfer to Australia necessary. It is unclear whether these asylum seekers are still in Australia.”

2020 WATCH:

-- The Democratic candidates have joined a new race – courting supporters of Kamala Harris. Annie Linskey, Chelsea Janes and Holly Bailey report: “Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next. … The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters. At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and [Biden] appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women. The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.”

-- Democrats were once excited about their diverse candidate field. That thrill is gone. Michael Scherer reports: “A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white. … The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black. … The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.”

-- Biden said he would consider Harris as a potential running mate. From CNN: “‘Of course I would,’ Biden said. ‘Look, Sen. Harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. I mean it sincerely. I talked to her yesterday. She's solid, she can be president someday herself, she can be vice president, she could go on to be a Supreme Court justice, she could be attorney general. I mean she has enormous capability.’”

-- The former vice president has not been energizing voters during his week-long bus tour around Iowa. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “The ‘No Malarkey’ tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails [Pete] Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors...""

-- Camping out in New Hampshire: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard rented a small house outside of Manchester, N.H., for the last months before the primary. From WMUR9: “‘We had a town hall in Rochester and then in Gilford right before the storm hit, and people said, 'You must be getting out of town,' and nope, we're here for the duration,’ Gabbard said. Gabbard tweeted out a photo of a snowbound yoga session at her new place Tuesday.”

-- A Republican House candidate called for Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (D-Minn.) execution. Katie Mettler and Hannah Knowles report: “In a fundraising letter sent last week and first reported on Tuesday by the Tampa Bay Times, the campaign of George Buck, a St. Petersburg Republican running for Congress, repeated falsehoods about Omar’s alleged ties to foreign nations. ‘We should hang these traitors where they stand,’ the email said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In an initial comment to that newspaper, Buck denied writing the campaign email, which arrived in the form of a letter and bore his signature. ‘That was not me. I did not see that,’ Buck told Times reporter Steve Contorno. ‘I would never talk like that.’ But Buck sent another statement later in the day that cited the federal punishment for treason, which includes death, prison time of at least five years and a fine of not less than $10,000. … House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) disavowed Buck’s words in a statement Wednesday, saying ‘there’s no place for inciting violence in politics.’”

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) shows no signs of voluntarily resigning from the House, despite his guilty plea to a felony campaign finance charge. From Politico: “When asked Wednesday about whether and when he intended to resign, Hunter blew off the question. ‘Good talk,’ Hunter told a Politico reporter. So far, neither Republican nor Democratic leaders have pressured Hunter to leave office, although there is precedent for expelling members who don’t step down following a criminal conviction. Hunter is not scheduled to be sentenced until March 17.”

Stephen Colbert had a few ideas about what Rudy Giuliani’s conversations with “-1” were like:"

THE BIG IDEA: Research experiments conducted by social scientists help illustrate why it’s so insidious for President Trump and his congressional defenders to keep parroting the debunked conspiracy theory, which originated with Russian intelligence agencies, that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

People who are repeatedly exposed to the same false information, even if they’re initially told that it is false, feel fewer qualms sharing it on social media after each additional time they see it. In five experiments involving more than 2,500 Americans, Daniel Effron, who teaches organizational behavior at the London Business School, and Medha Raj, a PhD student at the University of Southern California, documented how seeing a fake headline just once leads individuals to temper their disapproval of the misinformation when they see it a second, third or fourth time. They outline their findings in the new edition of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

The researchers asked online survey participants to rate how unethical or acceptable they thought it would be to publish a fake headline, and how likely they would be to like, share, block or unfollow the person who posted it. Participants were much more prone to “like” or share headlines they’d seen previously and less likely to block or unfollow the person who posted them, even if they were warned the information was false. The results shows a tendency of humans to misremember false headlines as true because they’ve seen them before. The researchers argue that repeating misinformation in the echo chamber of something like social media lends it a “ring of truthfulness” that can increase people’s tendency to give it a moral pass, regardless of whether they believe it.

“Misinformation can stoke political polarization and undermine democracy, so it is important for people to understand when and why it spreads,” said Effron.

-- Thus far, the truth is that the president’s broader efforts to muddy the waters surrounding the Ukraine affair have been remarkably effective. About four dozen national and state polls have now been conducted since the impeachment inquiry was announced. Public attitudes have stayed remarkably consistent, and they didn’t shift in a statistically significant way after the televised congressional hearings. Our in-house pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin review the data:

“Democrats and Republicans are mirror opposites on the issue, with an average of 86 percent of Democrats supporting impeachment, compared with 9 percent of Republicans. Democrats have grown more united in their support for impeachment since before the inquiry began, when polls showed roughly two-thirds supported impeachment. Among Republicans, an average of 87 percent are opposed, while 8 percent of Democrats say the same. …

“The stability of Trump’s approval ratings affirms just how locked-in Americans are in their views toward Trump, even as some independents and Democrats changed their opinion on whether Congress should impeach and remove him from office. The lack of movement in this essential measure of Trump’s political standing also indicates that while most Americans think Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, news and congressional testimony about this issue have not shifted how people feel about the president.”

-- Anecdotal evidence also bears this out. An Associated Press reporter interviewed voters around Wisconsin last week and found that many either aren’t paying attention or don’t know how to decipher the back-and-forth over the president’s conduct. To wit: “Everything they say, it’s so repetitive. To me, it’s like they’re beating their heads against the wall,” said Harry Rose, a 78-year-old retired factory worker and Trump supporter in Racine County. Nicole Morrison, a 36-year-old nurse who can’t see herself voting for Trump in 2020, had a similar review. “There’s so much information that sometimes it’s hard to decide which is the truth and which is just rumors,” she said. “So I just don’t pay attention to it.”

-- In a preface to the House Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday afternoon, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) noted that the core facts aren’t in dispute and warned about the “corrosive” dangers of tribalism. “If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism,” Schiff wrote. “Although the Framers viewed parties as necessary, they also endeavored to structure the new government in such a way as to minimize the ‘violence of faction.’ As George Washington warned in his farewell address, ‘the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.’”

The Constitution is mentioned more than 100 times in the 300-page report, which alleges that Trump “compromised national security to advance his personal political interests” and engaged in an “unprecedented campaign” to obstruct congressional efforts to uncover his abuses of power. “Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party,” Schiff concluded. “But perhaps even more corrosive to our democratic system of governance, the President and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences?”

-- A procession of events over the past 24 hours underscored the pervasiveness of factionalism. The Intelligence Committee approved Schiff’s report on a party-line, 13-to-9 vote. Republicans on the committee released their own 123-page prebuttal the day before that said Trump’s approach to Ukraine was founded on “genuine and reasonable” suspicions about the country.

-- Attending the NATO summit in London, meanwhile, Trump accused Democrats of being “unpatriotic” by moving ahead with impeachment while he’s traveling overseas. Trump then suggested that Schiff might be “in a jail” if he wasn’t in Congress for what he’s said about the president. “I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being,” Trump said. “I think he’s a very sick man.” Trump boasted that Democrats trying to impeach him is getting rank-and-file Republicans to rally around him. “I don’t think we’ve ever had the spirit right now that we have in the Republican Party, and the impeachment hoax is what’s done it,” he said, adding that the GOP is will stick together “like glue” because of the investigations.

Democrats punched back, such as New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. But this only underscored the partisan divisions:

Unpatriotic?



You are not a King.



You are not the Chosen One.



You are not the Supreme Leader.



You are an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to our democracy who will be held accountable for your brazen #AbuseOfPower.

A video that went viral overnight shows three foreign leaders apparently laughing about Trump’s antics behind his back during a reception at Buckingham Palace. Unaware that they were on camera, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seemed to ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron if they were late for their audience with Queen Elizabeth II because of Trump’s impromptu press conference. “You just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Trudeau answers.

This morning, Trump called Trudeau “two-faced” for his comments on the hot mic. Sitting beside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he added that the Canadian was just lashing out because he called him out for not spending enough money on defense.

-- Perhaps the most revealing illustration of the tribalism, though, came last night when 71 House Republicans voted against a bipartisan resolution saying that Russia should not be allowed to attend future Group of Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, gives Crimea back to Ukraine and adheres to the standards of democratic societies. The measure passed with 339 votes, including unanimous Democratic support and 116 Republicans.

Republican lawmakers loudly and overwhelmingly cheered Mitt Romney when, as the party’s nominee for president in 2012, he declared that Russia was the biggest geostrategic threat facing the United States. Now, with a very different standard-bearer in Trump, many of those same lawmakers try to look the other way as a revanchist Russia viciously asserts itself against free societies and deepens strategic ties with communist China. In this case, 71 did. (The list of Republicans who voted with Russia is here.)

Trump wants to welcome an emboldened Vladimir Putin back into the fold. At the G-7 summit in France this summer, Trump strongly advocated on Russia’s behalf over multiple days. He even announced plans to invite Putin to the G-7 summit in the United States. Rank-and-file Republicans take cues from right-wing elites, including Trump and Tucker Carlson, who has used his prime-time platform on Fox News to make some startling, eyebrow-raising comments about Russia in recent days. “I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine,” Carlson said last week.

-- A Post contributing columnist who formerly served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia and has held a senior post on the National Security Council under Barack Obama, chastised Carlson:

I speak Russian. I know Russia. I've lived there for 8 years of my life. You are wrong Mr. Carlson. Putin does hate America. You (I assume unwittingly) help his anti-American objectives with these ill-informed rants. Be a patriot.

-- “The inchoate and unproved nature of the Republican case against Ukraine has not prevented several GOP leaders from taking up the cause,” Bob Costa and Karoun Demirjian report. “There is also a growing view inside the GOP that the party’s core voters will not revolt if the party takes a softer position on Russia — a calculation backed by polling during Trump’s presidency. Gallup’s surveys, for instance, show that an expanding group of Republicans — 40 percent in July 2018 — now says Russia is a U.S. ally or is friendly, up from 22 percent in 2014, while 25 percent of Democrats say the same, little changed from 2014.”

“Historically, Republicans have been opposed to Russia, and they’re trying to do a narrative to help their guy,” said Thomas H. Kean, a Republican former governor of New Jersey who served as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission. “It’s a very strange time where there isn’t a center to govern around.”

-- As other Republicans have capitulated to Trump on Russia, Romney is holding firm. “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” the senator from Utah told reporters on Tuesday. “Leaders of the countries are pulling for one candidate or another, that’s to be expected, but there’s a big difference between pulling for someone, hoping someone wins in the American election and interfering in the way Russia did.”

-- Many Democratic lawmakers are forcefully rejecting the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered, but this also has the unintended consequence of drawing more attention to the underlying false claim. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he’s sat through more than 25 hearings and briefings about what happened in 2016. “In none of those meetings was there ever a hint, a breath, a suggestion, a word that somehow Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election in the interference or the influence campaign. It was Russia. And it was Russia in a systematic, widespread way,” King said on CNN.

Ukrainians, including government officials, spoke out against Trump publicly in 2016 after he said that maybe Crimea should remain part of Russia. “That would be like us being angry that somebody else took Florida,” King noted. “I mean, it was understandable, but that's been blown up into somehow that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 interference campaign. It wasn't.”

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), asked David Hale, the third-ranking official at the State Department, a hearing yesterday if there was any reason to doubt Fiona Hill’s testimony last month that the conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s interference in 2016 “is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services themselves.” Hale said he did. “Is our national security made stronger or weaker when members of the administration or members of Congress insist on repeating debunked Russian lies?” Menendez asked. “That does not serve our interest,” Hale replied.

-- This whole donnybrook is just the latest illustration of the president refusing to believe his own intelligence briefings. Speaking publicly for the first time since being pushed out of government after 30 years of service, former deputy director of national intelligence Sue Gordon told the Women’s Foreign Policy Group on Tuesday that one of Trump's most common responses to intelligence briefings is to doubt what he's being told. She said “I don’t think that’s true” was the president’s most frequent reply. Trump broke with protocol by blocking Gordon from becoming acting director of national intelligence when Dan Coats stepped down this summer.

“Gordon seemed to suggest that it was more difficult trying to figure out where the President had gotten the information that was shaping his beliefs and opinions than dealing with his tendency to doubt what he was being told,” CNN reports. “Gordon's ouster came about because Trump, who has had a contentious relationship with his own intelligence services, wanted a political loyalist in the role who would ‘rein in’ the intelligence agencies. … Gordon suggested that the President's intelligence briefers not only faced a challenge because of Trump's lack of familiarity with the world of intelligence, but also because he consumes information and hears opinions that aren't as carefully vetted as an intelligence product.”

-- Believe it or not, the rank partisanship will grow even starker as the impeachment process shifts today from the Intelligence Committee to the House Judiciary Committee. Trump’s defenders are intent on making the process look as partisan and circus-like as possible, and they now have a good venue to do so. Some of Capitol Hill’s most aggressive and colorful characters are members, from Matt Gaetz and Louie Gohmert on the Republican side to Steve Cohen and Sheila Jackson Lee on the Democratic side.

Nancy Pelosi gets to handpick the members of the Intelligence Committee. Schiff keeps his members on a much tighter leash. In contrast, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is much more free-wheeling. That’s partly how that Corey Lewandowski hearing got so out of hand in September. Nadler says he’s ready for the spotlight this time. (Elise Viebeck, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore the power dynamics within the committee more deeply.) “It’s a bunch of brawlers sometimes on the Judiciary Committee, so it should get pretty hot under the collar as we go along,” said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the panel, during an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Phone-call records disclosed in the Intelligence Committee’s new report show extensive contact between Rudy Giuliani and the White House during key moments of the Ukraine saga. Paul Sonne, Rosalind S. Helderman and Greg Miller report: “The call records provide powerful circumstantial evidence that Giuliani was coordinating with the White House on his Ukraine gambit, something Giuliani has previously acknowledged. The records also show contact between a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, and one of Trump’s key defenders in Congress, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.). … [Schiff] said ‘the phone records show that there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House.’ …

“Giuliani’s phone records include calls with a number designated only as ‘-1,’ sometimes close in time to calls between Giuliani and the White House switchboard. The suggestion is that ‘-1’ might be a phone belonging to Trump, though the report does not state that clearly. Schiff, speaking to the Los Angeles Times, said he suspects the number could be Trump’s and that the committee is trying to find out whether calls logged as ‘-1’ indeed came from the president. …

“The records show several calls and text messages in early August between Giuliani and numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. At that time, U.S. diplomats were trying to set up an Oval Office meeting between Trump and [Volodymyr Zelensky] that the Ukrainians were eager to schedule. Giuliani’s calls and texts include a nearly 13-minute call with an OMB official and ‘-1’ on Aug. 8. … The call records also show a number of phone calls between Nunes and Giuliani and between Nunes and Parnas earlier this year. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, has accused Nunes and his staff of participating in Giuliani’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.”

-- The report details 58 calls Giuliani made over the course of six days. (Philip Bump breaks them down here.)

-- Nunes, speaking last night to Sean Hannity on Fox News, said it’s “possible” that he spoke with Parnas, although he doesn’t recall doing so. “I remember that name now, because he’s been indicted,” said the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people. … We have Americans and foreigners contact us every single day with information.” He also dismissed questions about his contacts with Giuliani. “We were actually laughing about how [Bob] Mueller bombed out,” Nunes said of his conversations with Giuliani. (Felicia Sonmez)

THE LEGAL BATTLES:

-- Trump’s personal attorneys remain on the sidelines as the president battles the inquiry. Carol D. Leonnig reports: “The president is relying almost exclusively on White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his in-house team of attorneys … The White House lawyers are not sharing with his personal attorneys some internal government records central to the inquiry about the pressure the administration put on Ukraine, citing the need to protect executive privilege. The unusual decision to have the White House counsel captain the president’s defense — at least for now — departs from how previous presidents have contended with impeachment proceedings and has worried some Trump allies, who believe a multipronged defense would be stronger. … Cipollone has taken the lead, operating separately from Jay Sekulow, a conservative Christian legal advocate who is the leader of the president’s personal legal team, joined by seasoned white-collar defense lawyers Jane and Marty Raskin.”

-- A federal judge is weighing whether to order the State Department to release internal communications between Pompeo and two of the three men designated by Trump to steer Ukraine policy. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “U.S. District Judge Christopher R. ‘Casey’ Cooper of Washington on Tuesday heard arguments in a public-records lawsuit seeking communications by Kurt Volker, former State Department envoy to Ukraine, and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, with other State Department officials including Pompeo. … The Trump administration has declined to release records to the House, as part of the White House’s blanket refusal to cooperate in the impeachment probe. However, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) empowers judges to order the release of documents requested by members of the public, and federal lawsuits to enforce such requests can move much more quickly through the courts than battles over congressional subpoenas.”

-- A federal appeals court ruled that House Democrats can access Trump’s private financial records from two banks, citing a “public interest” by refusing to block congressional subpoenas. Ann E. Marimow and Renae Merle report: “The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information. The court gave the president seven days to seek review by the Supreme Court in the case … Sekulow said in a statement Tuesday that Trump’s legal team believes the subpoenas are ‘invalid as issued’ and is reviewing the ruling to determine next steps, ‘including seeking review at the Supreme Court.’”

-- A key witness in Mueller’s investigation has been indicted with seven others on charges of conspiring to funnel more than $3 million in illegal campaign contributions. Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: “George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates who acted as an intermediary for members of [Trump’s] presidential campaign seeking to forge contacts in the Middle East, was charged with conspiring to make conduit campaign contributions and related offenses in a 53-count indictment unsealed Tuesday in Washington, prosecutors said. U.S. prosecutors also charged Ahmad ‘Andy’ Khawaja, a Lebanese American businessman, with 35 counts related to allegations that he conspired with Nader to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in campaign contributions directed to U.S. political committees associated with presidential candidates.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race. Chelsea Janes reports: The California senator, “proud of being one of the only presidential candidates to spend Thanksgiving in Iowa and not at home, invited reporters into her temporary residence in Des Moines on the holiday to show off her turkey preparation skills. What she didn’t say at the time was that she was also having intensive conversations with her husband, her sister Maya Harris and Maya’s family as the tightknit group grappled with whether there was any path forward for her campaign. The talks extended into late Monday night, as Kamala Harris stayed up until 2 a.m. futilely trying to find a way to push on. But Tuesday around 12:45, she called her staffers to tell them it was all over. … [The end] marked a long, painful fall from her January kickoff, when Harris ran onstage to electrify a crowd of more than 22,000, the embodiment of Democratic hopes that she represented one of their best chances to beat Trump — a rising female star with a mixed-race background who could rebuild the coalition that propelled Barack Obama. …

“In a note to supporters Tuesday, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. ‘I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,’ she wrote. ... Some Democratic activists saw Harris’s departure as a troubling sign that minority candidates are not faring well despite the party’s ostensible sensitivity to diversity. … The news came as a particular shock to backers who that very morning had announced a super PAC to support Harris’s candidacy. Some donors spent the day frantically trying to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars they had wired into the super PAC’s account. …

""Harris remains a potentially appealing running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee. Unlike the senators staying in the race, she will be free to spend January focused on Trump’s expected Senate impeachment trial … An aide said an assessment of the campaign’s finances conducted over the weekend found that after raising about $12 million in each of the year’s first three quarters, the operation was failing to keep up that pace, raising just ‘a fraction’ of that amount this quarter. That left Harris without money to spend on ads in Iowa and elsewhere, essentially forcing her hand.”

-- Harris’s exit indicates that a once historically diverse Democratic field may winnow down to only whites. Philip Bump reports: “The six candidates who’ve earned a slot [in the next Democratic debate] are white. … Again, this was by design. The party didn’t want to have two dozen candidates crowding the debate stage with only two months to go until voting began. [The DNC's] strict criteria, though, have had the unexpected effect of making it easier for an extremely rich white man with no experience in elected office (Tom Steyer) to gin up the contributions and poll numbers needed to get a spot onstage, while experienced officials with more limited resources — like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or former HUD secretary Julián Castro — appear to come up short. The three are all doing about as well in the polls as each other, but Steyer’s incessant ads asking for contributions or boosting him just enough in just the right places give him the needed edge.”

-- Castro said Harris’s campaign suffered because the media holds candidates of color to different standards. From BuzzFeed News: “‘I don’t know if it impacted her decision to withdraw from the race or not, but I’m sure it didn’t help,’ Castro, the only Latino candidate running for president, [said] on Tuesday night. ‘This was a narrative from very early on. … From the earliest critique that she has no black support, the [Congressional Black Caucus] is going other directions. It’s just holding people to different standards,’ he said.”

-- As he fights to establish himself as the most liberal candidate, Bernie Sanders has split from Elizabeth Warren with his embrace of far-left foreign leaders. From Politico: “Sanders’ foreign policy views are a clear mark of distinction from Warren in a race in which their domestic agendas are viewed as very similar. Left-wing leaders around the world see an ally in Sanders — Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently thanked him for his ‘solidarity’ and Bolivia's ousted Evo Morales called him ‘hermano Bernie Sanders’ — but have not publicly embraced Warren in the same way. … Sanders has made clear during his campaign that he shares many of the left wing's long-held critiques of American imperialism — from opposition to clandestine interference across the world, but particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, to disapproval of the American military's global footprint. … Warren, by contrast, has been more cautious on foreign affairs, straddling the line between the left and the Democratic foreign policy establishment. She has not been as definitive about the situation in Bolivia, where Morales was forced to resign under pressure by the military after allegations of election fraud in what Sanders deemed a ‘coup.’ Nor has she gone out of her way to praise and cultivate relationships with leftist figures around the world.”

-- North Carolina has a new congressional map for 2020. Ted Mellnik and Tim Meko report: “According to the Associated Press, state judges said the new map, drawn last month by Republican legislators, was good enough for immediate use and that there was not time for further study. The map is likely to add two seats for Democrats in 2020, but it probably won’t end controversy over partisan gerrymandering in the state. … Based on 2016 election results, the new map appears to tilt five districts to Democrats and eight to Republicans. The two new congressional seats expected to favor Democrats are in the 6th and 2nd districts. The 6th will pool Democrats previously divided among three Republican districts around Greensboro. The new 2nd has been carved out of a Democratic stronghold in Raleigh. There is little change in the 12th District, where Charlotte Democrats and minorities remain packed. The Democratic seats under the new map are not locks for the party. The 1st, 2nd and 4th districts all lean Democratic by less than five points, meaning they could have competitive races in 2020.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Trump unsettled the world stage on the first day of the NATO 70th anniversary summit in London. Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum report: “Trump openly jousted with French President Emmanuel Macron — a leader who until recently had been one of Trump’s earliest and most prominent partners in bromance. He thrust Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uncomfortably into the spotlight, dubbing Trudeau’s country ‘slightly delinquent’ and asking for Canada’s ‘number’ on meeting its financial commitment to NATO’s shared defense. And he previewed a likely confrontation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, also over Germany’s financial contributions to NATO. … To watch Trump perform alongside other world leaders was to witness his use of disequilibrium as political strategy, deployed throughout his presidency to keep everyone slightly off-kilter. Over the course of three one-on-one meetings with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Macron and Trudeau, Trump turned what were expected to be brief photo opportunities into his own personal daytime cable show. As the other leaders largely bore witness, the U.S. president — frequently affable, occasionally bored — held forth for a collective two hours, fielding questions on topics ranging from the impeachment investigation he left at home to the British election campaign he flew into here. …

“At his afternoon appearance with Macron, Trump and the French president articulated their disagreements — at times quite forcefully — but with a veneer of conciliation. … Macron reiterated that he was not backing down from his comments to the Economist. … ‘When we speak about NATO, it’s not just about money. We have to be respectful with our soldiers. The first burden we share, the first cost we pay, is our soldiers’ lives,’ [Macron said]. Trump then turned to Macron and suggested that Europe — and the French president in particular — should shoulder more responsibility for taking back captured Islamic State fighters. ‘Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?’ Trump asked with a smirk. ‘I can give them to you.’ … By nightfall in London, Trump and Macron appeared to have put the day’s acrimony aside. … Several leaders will enter the formal NATO meeting on Wednesday with strategies inside their thick briefing books about what to do if Trump threatens to quit NATO on the spot.”

-- Today is the second day of the NATO summit, and participants are bracing for more contentious meetings. Michael Birnbaum raises the curtain: “Trump was scheduled for a day of highs and lows: after the three-hour discussion with all 28 other NATO leaders, he planned to have lunch with representatives from countries that are meeting spending alliance spending guidelines. It could be a moment to showcase his efforts to boost European defense contributions. But he will also have a one-on-one meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel … At the meeting, leaders are expected to approve a slew of new defense plans in a choreographed move intended to paper over the contentious relations of recent years. They will agree that outer space is a military domain that NATO needs to defend. They will also discuss how the alliance should handle the rise of China as a potential strategic threat. And they will agree on plans for Europe and Canada to spend more money on NATO’s central budget, to save the United States some money — a drop in the bucket in the context of overall defense spending, but still a symbolic gesture to Trump’s demands that other countries pick up some of the slack. Leaders are also expected to clash about a Turkish demand that the alliance give concessions about the Kurdish fighting groups in northeast Syria that have been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Erdogan says the Kurds are dangerous terrorists — and he has blocked unrelated approvals for updated military plans to defend the Baltics from Russia until he gets his way.”

-- The French government threatened massive European Union retaliation if Trump follows through on his threats to slap tariffs on dozens of popular French products. James McAuley reports: “Later in the day, [Trump] suggested that some kind of compromise might be achievable, and [Macron] indicated his willingness to work toward one. This came hours after Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, vowed what he called a ‘strong European riposte’ to Trump’s proposed tariffs.”

-- Trump announced that next year's G-7 summit will be held at Camp David after giving up plans to hold it at his private resort in Doral, Fla. Colby Itkowitz reports: ‘We’re going to do it at Camp David and we’ll be doing some special things at Camp David,’ Trump said. ‘It’s nearby, it’s close. We’re going to give really great access to the press, you’ll have great access. And we’ll have a little bit of a Washington deliverance. But it will be at Camp David, which is a place people like.’ The White House had previously panned suggestions that he host at Camp David in Maryland, as [Obama] had in 2012. ‘I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,’ acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had said in an Oct. 17 news conference. ‘It was way too small. It was way too remote.’”

-- Trump is waging a war of attrition against America’s diplomats. From GQ: “Previously unpublished data from the AFSA shows that the foreign service is losing people at an alarming clip. In the first two years of Trump’s presidency, nearly half of the State Department’s Career Ministers retired or were pushed out. Another 20 percent of its Minister Counselors, one rank level down, also left.”

-- Trump nearly avoided wading into British politics while at NATO. William Booth and Karla Adam report: The president “was relatively diplomatic Tuesday, promising to ‘stay out’ of British politics, just 10 days before a general election. But he couldn’t quite help himself. In the same breath, Trump declared that his ally Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ‘very capable and I think he’ll do a good job” if elected Dec. 12. As for Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, the president on Tuesday said, ‘I can work with anybody.’”

-- Murky allegations of supposed Russian interference in the British election are flying, with less than two weeks to go before voters head to the polls. Adam Taylor reports: “The latest victim is Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party and a challenger to the Conservative government of Boris Johnson, who had last month proudly displayed a series of leaked government documents that portrayed ongoing bilateral trade negotiations in an unflattering role. On Tuesday, the country’s leading center-right newspaper splashed its front page with a headline that argued the dossier ‘points to Russians.’ Citing an investigation by the consulting firm Graphika, the Daily Telegraph wrote that senior members of the Conservative Party were now calling for Corbyn to ‘come clean.’ But wait — hasn’t the Conservative government been asked to come clean, too? Yes, Johnson’s right-wing government has its own, unresolved issues with Russia. At the start of November, it was accused of sitting on a report that investigates possible Russian interference in British politics, delaying the release of the report’s supposedly damning findings until after the Dec. 12 vote.”

-- Global greenhouse gas emissions will hit another record high this year, experts project. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Total carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry totaled 36.8 billion tons, according to an estimate from the Global Carbon Project, an academic consortium that produces the figures annually. That represents a 0.6 percent increase from 2018, which until now stood as the record. … Global emissions have risen for three consecutive years, at a time when they should be starting to drop sharply if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The news of still-growing greenhouse gas emissions is the latest in a drumbeat of negative findings that come as world leaders gather in Madrid for an annual climate change conference, where they face mounting pressure to alter the current trajectory.”

​​​​​​-- North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is -- quite literally -- back on his white horse, inspecting “revolutionary battle sites” on a sacred mountain as Pyongyang foreshadowed a major policy decision later this month. Simon Denyer and Min Joo Kim report: “The images of Kim on horseback, returning to Mount Paektu after a similar visit in October, were high on symbolism. But it was a second, more dryly worded announcement on Wednesday that was at least as significant. The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided to convene the fifth plenary meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in the latter part of December, the Korean Central News Agency said, ‘to discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad.’ Put simply, after giving the United States until the end of the year to change its approach to denuclearization talks and warning that North Korea would follow a ‘new path,’ Kim appears to have made his decision on what that path should be, experts said.”

-- China criticized the U.S. House for passing a bill backing sanctions on Beijing over the mass detention of Muslims. Gerry Shih reports: “The Uighur Act cleared the House by 407 to 1 a week after [Trump] signed legislation that would sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials involved in human rights abuses in the protest-ridden financial hub. China has angrily denounced both measures and said Wednesday it would respond to the House’s passage of the Uighur Act, which must be reconciled with a Senate version passed in September before it reaches Trump’s desk. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged the United States to ‘immediately correct its mistake, stop the above bill on Xinjiang from becoming law, and stop using Xinjiang as a way to interfere in China’s domestic affairs.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- McKinsey, the consulting giant, has been helping to support the implementation of the Trump administration's immigration agenda. But some of their draconian suggestions for cost-cutting have been deemed as overly harsh, and even inhumane, by career ICE employees. From ProPublica and the New York Times: “ICE quickly redirected McKinsey toward helping the agency figure out how to execute the White House’s clampdown on illegal immigration. But the money-saving recommendations the consultants came up with made some career ICE workers uncomfortable. They proposed cuts in spending on food for migrants, as well as on medical care and supervision of detainees, according to interviews with people who worked on the project for both ICE and McKinsey and 1,500 pages of documents obtained from the agency after ProPublica filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. McKinsey’s team also looked for ways to accelerate the deportation process, provoking worries among some ICE staff members that the recommendations risked short-circuiting due-process protections for migrants fighting removal from the United States. The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — actions whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings.”

-- The Trump administration plans on cutting off food stamps benefits for about 750,000 Americans. From Bloomberg News: A new regulation will make it “harder for states to gain waivers from a requirement that beneficiaries work or participate in a vocational training program … The work requirement only applies to ‘able-bodied’ recipients who aren’t caring for a child under 6 years old. The measure would be the first of three Trump administration initiatives curtailing food stamp benefits to take effect. The Urban Institute estimated in an analysis last month that the measures together would cut 3.7 million beneficiaries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, often known by its previous name, food stamps.”

­-- The White House is torpedoing the bipartisan tradition of confirming nominees from both parties for positions at independent agencies. From the National Journal: “For decades, presidents have tapped Republican and Democratic nominees in tandem to fill open slots on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and many other independent bodies. But this week, senators are preparing to confirm Republican Robert Duncan to another term as chairman at one of those agencies, the United States Postal Service Board of Governors, without a Democratic companion.”

-- Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone resigned following accusations that he mishandled sex abuse cases. Chico Harlan reports: “Under Malone’s watch, Buffalo had become perhaps the U.S. Church’s most scandal-tainted diocese. It faces an FBI probe and more than 200 lawsuits. Malone pledged to institute reforms, but he was instead battered by accusations of coverup and by embarrassing leaks. One whistleblower said she found a 300-page dossier on accused priests hidden away in a supply closet near a vacuum cleaner. In a short statement, the Vatican said that Malone would be replaced on a temporary basis by Albany’s bishop, Edward Scharfenberger. Malone, 73, is departing two years before the mandatory age at which bishops must offer their retirements to Pope Francis — though many prelates stay on the job beyond the 75-year mark.”

-- Senate Republicans are poised to confirm either today or tomorrow a Trump judicial nominee who claimed that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave effects on society, including diminished respect for motherhood and the unique mother-child bond; exploitation of women; commodification of gestation and of children themselves; and weakening of appropriate social mores against eugenic abortion.” HuffPost reports: “Sarah Pitlyk, [Trump’s] nominee to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, argued those points in a 2017 amicus brief opposing a California statute that protects the right to assisted reproductive technology like in vitro fertilization, or IVF, and gestational surrogacy. Pitlyk … went on to say in a 2017 interview with the National Catholic Register that ‘surrogacy is harmful to mothers and children, so it’s a practice society should not be enforcing.’ Nearly 1 in 6 U.S. couples face infertility, according to a 2014 National Institutes of Health study.

“Pitlyk, 42, fits the mold of many of Trump’s judicial nominees: She’s young, white and a member of the Federalist Society. … She defended anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, who broke federal and state laws by secretly recording and deceptively editing videos that falsely claimed to expose Planned Parenthood’s illegal sale of fetal tissue. She defended Iowa’s six-week abortion ban that was later struck down as unconstitutional. In another case, Pitlyk argued that it is ‘scientific fact’ that ‘human life begins at the moment when a human sperm fertilizes a human egg.’ (It is not scientific fact.)

“So far, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the only Republican who plans to oppose Pitlyk’s confirmation, meaning Pitlyk has the votes to be confirmed. In a statement, Collins cited Pitlyk’s ‘troubling assertions’ about fertility treatments. … Collins also raised concerns with Pitlyk earning a rare and embarrassing “not qualified” rating by the American Bar Association based on her lack of experience. The rating was unanimously decided. … Pitlyk previously clerked for Brett Kavanaugh. … When Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Pitlyk came to his defense. … Pitlyk also publicly dismissed Ford’s story, saying in a CNN interview that it was ‘hard to take it seriously…’”

-- Describing it as an “untamed beast” in “distress,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos wants to spin off the Federal Student Aid office into a new agency. Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports: “The proposal follows a series of missteps involving the office that intensified scrutiny of DeVos’s leadership, including the release of $11 million in loans to unaccredited for-profit colleges and the violation of a court order to halt collections on former Corinthian Colleges students. … Policy experts have questioned whether the office has the economic expertise to meet the challenge and have recommended changes, but they have stopped short of calling for anything on the scale of what DeVos is proposing. … The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators has long urged Congress to review whether the Federal Student Aid office is subject to enough supervision by the education secretary. DeVos referred to the trade group’s past critiques of the office in her speech Tuesday, but the group’s president, Justin Draeger, noted that spinning off the unit was never among its recommendations.”

-- The Supreme Court seems skeptical that Superfund landowners can seek a more extensive cleanup than what the Environmental Protection Agency has approved. Robert Barnes reports: ""The court was considering a massive cleanup of arsenic from a 300-square-mile section of Montana where a copper smelter operated for nearly 100 years. The Anaconda valley has been a Superfund cleanup site since 1983, and owner Atlantic Richfield already has spent more than $470 million to remove toxic chemicals from the land. But nearly 100 homeowners in the area want more work done, and they went to state court in hopes of convincing a jury that the company should pay an additional $50 million to reduce the arsenic level in the ground. The Montana Supreme Court said the suit could proceed. But the question for the U.S. Supreme Court was whether such a supplemental lawsuit undermines the EPA’s authority to implement a cleanup plan it deems appropriate for all parties.”

-- New York City is shipping its homeless to squalid housing out of the state, officials in Newark allege in a new lawsuit. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “The complaint, which names the city of New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks as defendants, accuses the city’s Special One-Time Assistance program, or SOTA, of violating commerce laws by pushing recipients into Newark apartments that are not suitable for living and sometimes illegal. The suit comes amid a national battle to mitigate a national homeless crisis that has left many of the country’s urban areas desperate for answers.”

-- Rep. Steve Watkins (R-Kan.) is facing perjury and voter fraud allegations for listing a UPS store as his home residence. From the Topeka Capital-Journal: “Shawnee County records show the first-term Republican listed his official residence as 6021 S.W. 29th St. in Topeka, which corresponds to a UPS Store, when he signed a form to change his residency for voter registration purposes in August, signed an application for a mail-in ballot in October and signed a document to complete advance voting for the November election. It isn’t clear where the congressman physically resided in Kansas after August nor what Topeka precinct he was legally qualified to be part of when voting in November. By asserting his place of residence to be the UPS Store, Watkins left the Topeka City Council’s 5th District for the city council’s 8th District. He then cast a November ballot in an 8th District contest decided by 13 votes.”

-- The D.C. Council voted unanimously to recommend Jack Evans for expulsion over multiple ethics violations. Fenit Nirappil reports: “The action comes after a series of investigations that found Evans, the city’s longest-serving lawmaker, used his public office to benefit private clients and employers who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars. … A person who spoke to Evans on Tuesday afternoon said the lawmaker recognized his council tenure was over and was concerned about being the first member to be expelled but was not yet prepared to resign. … Evans has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. In a letter sent last week, Evans’s lawyers argued that expulsion would override the will of voters.”

President Trump risks tipping the United States — and the world — into recession if he presses ahead with tariffs on Chinese imports set to bite in just 11 days.

That’s the conclusion some economists are drawing after the president renewed trade tensions with Beijing by saying he was open to waiting until after the 2020 election to reach a deal some advisers recently described as imminent.

“The economy is on the precipice and this would just push us over into the abyss. I don’t think we’re very far from recession as it is,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi tells me.

Zandi sees a cascade effect ricocheting through the economy if the administration follows through on its threat to impose 15 percent import levies on $160 billion of Chinese goods, a list that includes laptops, cellphones, toys and other consumer goods. “It would just be too much,” he said of the tariffs planned for December 15. “It would undermine investor confidence, weaken business sentiment and the negative reinforcing dynamics of a recession would take hold.”

Investors are processing the renewed threat, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1 percent, its third straight day of losses and the steepest one-day sell-off since early October, as the Wall Street Journal’s Michael Wursthorn and Anna Isaac write.

Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said his firm projects the next round of tariffs would trim 0.2 percent from economic growth. “It’s not huge, but it’s one additional layer of drag on top of the tariffs we’ve already seen,” he said. “I would note the possibility that the loss of confidence from the private sector would exacerbate that.”

Daco says tariffs alone would be unlikely to precipitate a recession. But like Zandi he said they could ripple out dangerously if they depress business confidence, weighing on financial markets, reducing hiring and, ultimately, crimping consumer spending. “If we have an end of the year like last year,” with tariffs rising, a government shutdown looming, and the Federal Reserve signaling it won't help, Daco noted, “We’re starting off from a much lower point in activity now, and the risks of a recession going into 2020 are that much greater.”

How seriously to take the possibility the Trump team fails to reach an agreement with its Beijing counterparts that forestalls the tariffs remains uncertain. While in London for NATO's 70th anniversary summit, Trump said ""in some ways I like idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal."" Still, he noted that the Chinese ""want to make a deal now and we will see whether or not the deal is going to be right.""

But Bloomberg News reports despite the heated rhetoric, Washington and Beijing are moving closer to agreeing on how many tariffs already in force should be rolled back as part of a phase-one deal. And the WSJ's Bob Davis and Lingling Wei report the recent involvement of White House adviser Jared Kushner could indicate a deal is close-at-hand.

Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors, said his firm has been telling clients they believed the Dec. 15 deadline didn’t necessarily mean much: As long as the two sides were continuing to negotiate in good faith, the Trump team was likely to find a way to put them off. Now, he says, “it's fluid in the sense that Dec. 15 is starting to look like a harder deadline than it was, say, 48 hours ago. But that in and of itself can change.”

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to underscore the two sides still have difficult issues to resolve, and the U.S. feels no urgency to strike a deal. Ross told Reuters in an interview that the point Trump, in his comments at the NATO summit in London, “was trying to make is we need a proper deal, and whether it comes this December, or it’s next December, or some other date is much less important than getting a proper deal.”

“The important thing is to get a deal that works,” he said. “Because let’s face it, if we don’t make a deal with China now, it’s going to be a long, long time before there is a deal.”

Investors perceive a pattern they hope will play out again in the coming days: Trump tends to ramp up trade confrontations when the stock market is gaining steam and back off when it tumbles. The president was dismissive of the trade-induced selloff, calling it “peanuts.” And, he said, “I don’t watch the stock market.” The claim is belied by his own Twitter feed:

Trump: ""I don't watch the stock market."" pic.twitter.com/9BCb059zLE — Ivan the K™ (@IvanTheK) December 3, 2019

“There’s this binary moment in the market where people are freaking out, and there’s also a group that says, ‘He’s focused on reelection, and he knows how bad this would be for it, so he’ll pull back,’” Myrow says. “There’s a lot of post-hoc rationalization. But a lot of this comes down to what was on Fox News that morning, what did he have for breakfast, and what’s going on with impeachment.”

MARKET MOVERS

— All eyes on payrolls number. CNBC's Patti Domm: ""Wednesday’s report of ADP private payrolls could give clues on the labor market, the next part of the economy to be scrutinized after an important manufacturing report showed an unexpected decline. ADP is expected to show that 140,000 payrolls were added in September, following 195,000 in its report in August. That August number was not a good barometer for the much lower government report of just 96,000 private payrolls in August, but it will be watched nonetheless. Total payrolls were 130,000 in August, including government workers.""

— Investors look to fiscal stimulus. Bloomberg News's Gregor Stuart Hunter: ""The next push for the global economy may come from governments instead of central banks -- and the outcome for markets could be messy. Synchronized monetary easing helped keep global stocks and bonds afloat amid a succession of bruising trade disputes and geopolitical flare-ups in 2019. But the effect may tail off soon, and an array of government spending measures designed to fuel growth may produce much more divergent results.

""The outlook for markets in the next year varies 'drastically' from country to country in line with the ability of each to deploy fiscal stimulus, said Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. The result will be 'incredibly wide dispersion' for stock markets 'and quite a bit of volatility therein,' she said.""

— Post-Thanksgiving shopping was no turkey after all: “A record 189.6 million Americans went shopping over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said, and most of them did their spending online,” my colleague Abha Bhattarai reports.

“The new bar represents a 14 percent increase from last year, the industry lobbying group said. About 48 million consumers shopped only in stores, 66 million shopped only online, and 76 million shopped both in stores and online.”

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— Mexican official’s return signals possible USMCA momentum: “Mexican undersecretary for North America Jesús Seade is headed back to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this week, three people familiar with the plans told Politico,” Megan Cassella and Sabrina Rodríguez report.

“The meeting comes as the two sides are racing to wrap up a compromise on changes to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. After a flurry of meetings late last week involving Seade, Lighthizer and Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, the U.S. had asked Mexico for a response by [Tuesday], a fourth person closely following the talks said.”

— France fires back on possible tariffs: “The French government fired back Tuesday against the Trump administration’s threats to slap hefty tariffs on dozens of popular French products, insisting that the European Union would retaliate if the White House went through with its proposal,” my colleague James McAuley reports from Paris.

“Later in the day, President Trump suggested that some kind of compromise might be achievable, and French President Emmanuel Macron indicated his willingness to work toward one. This came hours after Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, vowed what he called a ‘strong European riposte’ to Trump’s proposed tariffs — as much as 100 percent on about $2.4 billion in imported goods, including wines, cheeses and certain designer clothes.”

Key quote: “We need to be pugnacious,” Agnès Pannier-Runacher, a junior economy minister, said speaking to France’s Sud Radio.

— Ross said imported auto tariffs might still be possible: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that “the Trump administration has not ruled out imposing tariffs on imported autos, after letting a review period end in November with no action,” Reuters’s David Shepardson reports.

“[Trump] did not announce any new tariffs after a six-month, self-imposed review period expired in mid-November following a Commerce Department investigation into whether imported autos pose a national security threat. He has threatened to tax them by as much as 25%.”

— Huawei could have been kicked out of U.S. banking system: “The Trump administration considered banning China’s Huawei from the U.S. financial system earlier this year as part of a host of policy options to thwart the blacklisted telecoms equipment giant, according to three people familiar with the matter,” Reuters’s Alexandra Alper reports.

“The plan, which was ultimately shelved, called for placing Huawei Technologies Co, the world’s second largest smartphone producer, on the Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. One of the people familiar with the matter, who favors the move, said it could be revived in the coming months depending on how things go with Huawei. The plan was considered by the White House National Security Council, and seen by officials as a nuclear option atop a ladder of policy tools to sanction the company, two of the people said. Such a designation can make it virtually impossible for a company to complete transactions in U.S. dollars.”

— Verizon CEO doesn’t want 5G “cold war”: “Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg told CNBC ... that he does not want geopolitical tensions around 5G technology to become further inflamed,” CNBC’s Kevin Stankiewicz reports.

“Asked whether he thought the fight between the U.S. and Chinese tech giant Huawei could result in a so-called 5G cold war, creating a fractured global network, Vestberg said, ‘I hope not.’ ”

The US can't use Cold War tactics to engage with China, says former NSA head Michael Rogers China's main goal is to achieve 21st century technological dominance, argued Admiral Michael Rogers, former head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, in a recent cybersecurity podcast. He also explained some of the tactics that are hard to counter, such as IP theft, government subsidies of tech companies, and linking corporate interests to education and government research. CNBC

“The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information. The court gave the president seven days to seek review by the Supreme Court in the case, which predates the public impeachment proceedings in the House.”

POCKET CHANGE

Google CEO Sundar Pichai. (Jeff Chiu/AP)

— Massive change at Google's parent company: “Google co-founder Larry Page is stepping down as CEO of the search giant’s parent company in favor of Google CEO Sundar Pichai, marking a major shift for one of the world’s most valuable companies,” my colleague Greg Bensinger reports.

“Page and co-founder Sergey Brin will no longer be involved in day-to-day operations of Alphabet, the parent company, according to an announcement, though they will keep their board seats. Page has turned over the CEO role once before, in 2001, to Eric Schmidt, who held the post for nearly 10 years before handing the reins back to Page.”

What’s next: “Pichai inherits sole responsibility for a company buffeted by antitrust investigations and the ire of [Trump]. Under Pichai, Google has been trying to become more buttoned up, amid a series of leaks to the media and worker pushback. Some things will remain the same: Brin and Page hold a majority of the company’s voting stock, meaning major board decisions still need their stamp of approval.”

— India is changing the rules after tech giants bet big: “After Walmart Inc. sealed a $16 billion deal last year to buy India’s biggest domestic e-commerce startup, it got some bad news. India was changing its e-commerce regulations,” the Wall Street Journal’s Newley Purnell reports.

“Foreign-owned online retailers would need to modify their supply chains and stop deep discounting. Those rules didn’t apply to Indian companies. India, the world’s biggest untapped digital market, has suddenly become a much tougher slog for American and other international players.”

Where this push is coming from: “Seeking to match China’s success at protecting and promoting homegrown tech giants, such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and TikTok parent Bytedance Inc., India is increasingly trying to shelter domestic companies.”

“Seeking to match China’s success at protecting and promoting homegrown tech giants, such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and TikTok parent Bytedance Inc., India is increasingly trying to shelter domestic companies.” Who is at risk: “In the crosshairs, beyond Walmart, are firms including Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. and its WhatsApp messaging service.” (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post)

— Bridgewater co-CEO to depart: “Bridgewater Associates said Eileen Murray plans to step down as co-chief executive in March, culminating a sometimes rocky leadership transition at the world’s largest hedge fund,” the WSJ’s Rachael Levy reports.

“David McCormick, who has shared duties with Ms. Murray since 2017, will become sole CEO, the firm said. Bridgewater, which manages $160 billion in assets, said the change marks the end of founder Ray Dalio’s succession planning. That process has been marked by tumult. Mr. McCormick’s elevation represents the sixth change to Bridgewater’s chief-executive lineup since 2016.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Harris drops out: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris's “departure is the latest surprise in a Democratic primary that has repeatedly defied prediction, with several prominent senators, as well as candidates of color, struggling in a political landscape marked by anger, passion and a desperate Democratic desire to unseat Trump. The other early star of the campaign, former congressman Beto O’Rourke (D-Tex.), dropped out a month ago,” my colleague Chelsea Janes reports.

Why now?: “In a note to supporters, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. 'I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,' she wrote. 'My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.' ""

“In a note to supporters, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her departure. 'I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,' she wrote. 'My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.' "" But the news came as a shock to some of Harris's biggest backers: Some of those supporters had “just announced a super PAC to support Harris’s candidacy. Some donors spent the day frantically trying to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars they had wired into the super PAC’s account. One of Harris’s biggest backers, Quinn Delaney, had even approved a large transfer of funds to pay for an Iowa television ad from the new super PAC — a fact unknown to the Harris staffers as they prepared to pull the plug.”

A parting blow: "" 'I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,' "" Harris wrote her letter, a not-so-subtle shot at former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and financier Tom Steyer.

It’s interesting to recall that just over two months ago there was speculation that Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign might be finished. After the natural initial fears faded, nobody really thought his heart attack would keep him from staying in the race. But the general feeling outside his own camp was that it was a potential coup de grace for an already-struggling campaign that had lost a lot of its mojo to the high-flying Elizabeth Warren.

Instead, Sanders has hung in there and improved his relative position even as Warren has lost altitude. And as pundits have come back around to examining his base of support, many have come to realize something about it that is somewhat different and quite important, as Ron Brownstein reports:

[T]here are signs Hispanics may prove a kind of secret weapon for Sanders. In a recent Fox News poll of Nevada, Hispanics there preferred Sanders over Biden by 7 percentage points. Sanders also led Biden with them by 9 points in a recent Latino Decisions poll of California and doubled the former vice president’s vote among them in the University of Texas at Tyler poll. Sanders narrowly led Biden with Hispanics in a New York Times/Siena poll of Florida, and the two ran even in Arizona, according to the OH Predictive Insights survey.

The evidence of Sanders’s strength among Latinos is everywhere, most recently in a University of California IGS survey of the Golden State, where Sanders led the field, in no small part because of his 32 percent showing (Biden is second at 19 percent) among Latinos.

Brownstein notes that Sanders did well among younger Latinos in 2016, but quotes his pollster to the effect that Bernie is now exhibiting “more appeal across generations” in this demographic group. Perhaps — though cross tabs from Morning Consult’s most recent tracking poll show Sanders leading Biden 40/16 (with Warren at 11) among under-35 Latinos and 24/18 (with Warren at 16) among Latinos aged 34–44. But among Latinos aged 45–65, Biden leads Sanders 35/16 (Warren is at 12) and among Latino seniors Biden’s lead balloons to 45/10 (with Warren at 9). Sanders has an overall 29/23 lead over Biden (with Warren at 12) in this demographic because Latinos are an unusually young ethnic group.

The age factor is also critical to Sanders’s solid if less-powerful positioning among African-American voters, too. According to Morning Consult, Bernie is leading Joe Biden among under-30 black voters by a 41/23 margin. But at the other end of the age spectrum, among black seniors, Biden trounces Sanders 61/6.

As I noted recently, Sanders and Biden have joined Andrew Yang and Julian Castro as the remaining candidates who are drawing more support from nonwhite than white voters (by contrast, according to CNN data, Warren’s white/nonwhite percentages are at 17/9, and Pete Buttigieg’s are at 17/4). As the nomination contest calendar moves to more diverse states after New Hampshire, this dimension of their electoral bases could help them rebound from losses to Warren and/or Buttigieg in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire."

In the fond hopes of those who consider some sort of single-payer health-care system essential, 2020 once looked like the year that would give their movement a giant leap forward. Initially no fewer than 13 Democratic presidential candidates (Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Bill de Blasio, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Tim Ryan, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Eric Swalwell, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) said they favored some sort of single-payer plan. Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, and Warren were original cosponsors of Bernie Sanders’s signature Medicare for All bill, an uncompromising version of single-payer, while Gabbard, Ryan, and Swalwell had co-sponsored the House counterpart bill.

But as the invisible primary segment of the 2020 cycle proceeded with its debates and fast-changing rivalries, support for Sanders-style M4A splintered, and public support for it declined significantly, too. The latter erosion of once-robust majorities favoring Sanders’s approach was likely attributable to a combination of relentless attacks from the health-care industry, and to a growing public understanding that “Medicare for All” really meant single-payer health-care, with no room for the private insurance policies that, after all, about 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had chosen through the Medicare Advantage option.

Partly thanks to debate moderator interest in sowing conflict among the Democratic candidates, hair-splitting over the details of various Medicare for All and then Medicare for Most proposals became and remained a prominent part of intraparty conflict. And before long, supporters of progressive candidates were using the health-care postures of their opponents to paint them as corporate sell-outs, while supporters of moderate candidates scored M4A as a general election loser. Far from ushering in a consensus for a big leap toward universal health coverage, the M4A debate has unsettled the Democratic Party on the one issue they think they “own” against Republicans. At least one major candidate, Kamala Harris, arguably ran a promising campaign right into the ground via feckless efforts to take and explain a more nuanced position.

As Vox’s Ezra Klein explains, M4A has become almost entirely a symbolic issue:

In Democratic Party politics, Medicare has become a which-side-are-you-on test. Are you with Sanders and the left, and against insurance companies, squishy moderates, commodified health care, and a politics of preemptive compromise? Or are you afraid that Sanders and the left are going to scare the country into reelecting Donald Trump and set health care reform back for a generation?

This is a fundamentally political question, and splitting the difference through complex acts of technocracy ends up alienating both sides.

That was definitely true of Kamala Harris’s proposal, and Elizabeth Warren’s transition plan to M4A was quickly attacked by hardcore single-payer fans as a sell-out. But as Klein notes, there’s an air of unreality about all these arguments, because M4A simply isn’t happening in the near-term:

The ferocity of this debate is at odds with the legislative reality. Even if a Democrat wins, Medicare-for-all will not pass the House and it will not pass the Senate. “I’m not a big fan of Medicare for All,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. When I interviewed the key Senate Democrats who will write the next health reform bill, none of them supported Medicare-for-all or believed it could pass.

So are Democrats doomed to fight each other over M4A right up to and beyond the 2020 elections, feeding Republican attack lines on them as both feckless and socialistic?

Klein suggests a sort of Nixon-to-China solution: Anoint Sanders the nominee (or at least the chief Democratic spokesman on health-care, I suppose) as the one candidate with the progressive street cred to gently explain to single-payer advocates that compromise will be necessary:

Sanders also has a unique level of credibility with the party’s more ideological left wing. His commitment to Medicare-for-all is sufficiently steadfast that leftists will believe him if and when he has to convince them that the compromised bill Congress is prepared to pass is the best bill they’re going to get. He wrote the damn bill; he might be the only one who can cut the damn deal. And if Sanders was able to get an ambitious Medicare-for-more plan through Congress and make it look like a compromise, it’d be a tremendous legislative coup.

This does make some sense, because Sanders either has — or will have to — develop a Plan B when the pixie-dust “political revolution” he has claimed will suddenly sweep Congress toward M4A fails to materialize. But in the mean time, of course, making M4A official party gospel will expose the party to a multi-billion-dollar “no socialized medicine” campaign during the general election.

Perhaps it would be best for Democrats to muddle through the primaries while trying to keep differences on health-care policy from appearing as vast as the gulf between virtually all Democrats and virtually all Republicans. But if they do win, whether he’s president of the United States or simply a very distinguished U.S. senator, Bernie Sanders may still be called to the patriotic duty of explaining that the “political revolution” has its limits."

Sandys/The Washington Post via Getty Im

Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have spent the last several months attempting to wriggle free of a trap they set for themselves two and a half years ago, when the leading contenders jumped aboard Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan. Politico has a story detailing how this bizarre debacle came out.

Before 2017, the dominant view within the Democratic Party held that single-payer insurance is a theoretically superior policy design that is impossible to obtain, at least in the short run. The unfortunate reason for this is the path dependency created by the peculiar American system, which, beginning in World War II, built a system in which employers provided insurance to most working adults. Generations of Democratic presidents — Truman, Johnson, Clinton — tried and failed to steer the system off the course. But the high cost of the system paradoxically made it harder to dislodge, as it created more constituencies with an interest in maintaining the status quo (insurers, doctors, hospitals, drugmakers) and made people who had employer-sponsored insurance ever more skittish about losing their benefits.

President Obama’s solution was to leave the employer system in place and build around it to cover the people outside the system: Medicaid expansion would cover those with the lowest incomes, and a regulated and subsidized market would offer insurance to those in the middle class who were locked out of the employer system. Obama’s reforms worked — imperfectly, like any social reform in history, but unambiguously. Obamacare’s remaining holes — excessive premium costs for high-income customers, and the refusal by some red states to join Medicaid expansion — could be patched up at relatively little cost.

What would be extraordinarily difficult would be moving the 150 million Americans already covered by employer insurance onto a public plan. It would require, first, transferring the cost of their insurance off the books of their employers, which is largely invisible, and onto the federal budget, requiring major tax hikes, It would also require persuading them that they’d be better off with a public insurance plan than their current coverage. I believe they would, but closing that sale to an electorate that is averse to change and suspicious of politicians is an extraordinary hurdle. It seemed crazy to multiply the fiscal cost and political risk of the Democrats’ health-care position merely to change the coverage of Americans who already had insurance.

Yet somehow, in the summer of 2017, almost all the Democratic presidential candidates decided to do just that.

At the time, the left had gained the appearance of an ascent that far outstripped its actual power. The aftermath of the 2016 election had persuaded progressive activists that Bernie Sanders was the party’s future, and had lost either due to cheating (as hard-core supporters maintained) or Hillary Clinton’s name recognition and establishment support. The future belonged to Bernie, or at least his ideas. The debate was taking place largely within Twitter, which magnified the views of progressive activists and intellectuals and underrepresented those of both the party’s voters and elected officials.

Politico’s reporting fills in some of the details that explain the foolhardy rush to endorse the Sanders bill, which proposed to fold the entire health-care system into Medicare, without explaining any of the tradeoffs that had made such an undertaking impossible. Two unnamed policy aides say they knew at the time the bill was not a finished product. But Kamala Harris leaped aboard, moving so quickly she joked at the time of her announcement that her own staff would be learning of her stance in real time.

At this point, the fear of being outflanked and holding an apparently unpopular “no we can’t” position took hold. “Kamala’s decision started a stampede,” one campaign operative tells Politico. “Some of them were checking the box of doing what they felt they needed to in order to appease the progressives,” another campaign adviser admits.

It took two years for the candidates to grasp the liability they had taken on. Progressive activists circulated polls showing “Medicare for All” drew broad public support, but that support rested on the absence of details. Once voters were told the policy involved higher taxes or moving everybody off employer-sponsored insurance, the bottom fell out. The strategy of attacking anybody who pointed this out as an industry shill was only going to work for so long.

At this point, the main distinction between the rivals to Sanders is the speed and distance with which they’ve raced away from his bill. Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg almost immediately declared their support to be aspirational and symbolic. Harris oscillated disastrously between renewing her support and disavowing the bill (which is itself rather galling, given the the role she played in stampeding her colleagues toward it in the first place). Elizabeth Warren grasped tightly to the bill over the summer, then rolled out an elaborate series of pay-fors, and only now is endorsing an interim plan that she promises to undertake first, before getting to Medicare for All by the end of her term. (In reality, she is signaling that later means never, but the question is whether that will allow her to disavow the attacks on the bill if she wins the nomination.) Ed Kilgore’s case that Bernie himself will need to bail the Democrats out of the jam created by their support for his bill is an indication of just how dire the situation has grown.

Progressive activists are not the only source of bad political ideas. Moderates have bad ideas, too. Yet what is so striking about the Medicare for All debacle is how foreseeable it was, and how so many candidates plunged ahead simply because all the other candidates were doing it, too."

It fell by 3 points for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to 14%, and it declined by 1 point to 6% for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, entered the race as the fifth-most popular candidate with 4% support. Support for Warren dropped by 2 points to 9% in the national poll, the worst showing for the U.S. senator from Massachusetts in the Reuters/Ipsos poll since August.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) is at 4 percent as well.

This is one poll — a national poll at that, but still. If one looks at either state or national polling, Warren’s numbers have dropped significantly over the last few months. The media have been so fascinated with the “Biden is faltering” meme that they seem to have ignored the bigger, more accurate assessment: Warren has been in decline as Sanders and Buttigieg rise. In the RealClearPolitics averages, Warren is third in both Iowa and New Hampshire, both races she looked poised to win just weeks ago. Unlike Biden, who can afford a mediocre showing and wait for states with high percentages of African Americans, Warren so far is not pulling heavily from nonwhite voters.

AD

AD

The reasons for her decline are several: Her botched Medicare-for-all plan, an overreliance on plans (when others now have plenty of plans as well), questions about electability (tied to Medicare-for-all) and the rise of fresher candidates who are more interesting. Certainly she is still in the top tier and has the organization and money to potentially prevail, but if you believe in political momentum, hers is going in reverse.

It is worth stressing that the parade of debates has not helped the primary electorate settle on a favorite. When nearly a third of voters are still undecided, you wonder if some of the dropouts might have hung around for a while. (Klobuchar is the quintessential example of a candidate who is stuck in low single digits but just keeps chugging along; she isn’t yet in the top tier, but she at least is going in the right direction.) It is also possible that when candidates leave the race, voters, even ones for whom the departing candidate was the top pick, reassess. So who is left now? What’s my choice? People are intuitively illogical in that they can prefer A to B and B to C, but not A to C. (A voter might say, “Hey, I like Warren more than Biden, Biden more that Klobuchar, but whoops, I’d take Klobuchar over Warren.”)

Throw in one more possible reset moment: As of now, it looks like only six (maybe up to eight) candidates will qualify for the December debate stage. Perhaps that will help voters settle on a favorite. Certainly it is easier to choose one of six than one of 12. Those candidates who do not make the stage — some for the second time (e.g., Julián Castro) — may finally have to call it quits. Where those voters land is anyone’s guess.

In sum, less than 60 days out from the Iowa caucuses, the race is entirely up in the air. It’s good news for Warren that voters are still kicking the tires; the bad news is some voters have already bypassed her.

Not long before his assassination, Martin Luther King Jr. announced the formation of the Poor People’s Campaign. The project would eventually unite poor whites from Appalachia with farmworkers, indigenous people, and black civil-rights activists. After King’s death in 1968, the campaign marshaled a significant mobilization in Washington, D.C., and then went quiet — until 2017. Revived by Reverend William Barber and Reverend Liz Theoharis, the renewed Poor People’s Campaign continues the mission set out by King and his allies so many decades ago. Its ambitions are broad: On its website, it says it intends to “lift up and deepen the leadership of those most affected by systemic racism, poverty, the war economy, and ecological devastation.” It goes on to state, bluntly, that “people should not live in or die from poverty in the richest nation ever to exist.”

Since its revival, the multiracial, interfaith campaign organized six weeks of civil disobedience last year in addition to bus tours of impoverished communities. Earlier this year, the campaign also hosted several Democratic candidates for president, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, at a forum so they could answer questions from activists. (Another candidate, Pete Buttigieg, spoke at Barber’s Goldsboro, North Carolina, church in recent days.) In June 2020, the campaign intends to organize a march in Washington, D.C., to coincide with its first ever Poor People’s Assembly, which will train the nation’s attention on poverty and related issues ahead of the presidential election. That work serves the campaign’s principal goals: to force a more honest conversation about the state of inequality in America, and to make sure that conversation leads to substantive political change.

The new Poor People’s Campaign builds in part on the Moral Mondays movement, which began in 2013 as a series of demonstrations against the policies of North Carolina’s then-governor, Pat McCrory. Barber, known to many as one of the lead organizers of the Moral Mondays protests, spoke to Intelligencer two weeks ago about the Poor People’s Campaign, the upcoming election, and the obstacles in the way of a more equitable American future.

This interview has been edited for clarity and condensed for length.

Polling suggests that Americans tend to think of themselves as middle class, even if their household incomes are low. But historically, the Poor People’s Campaign has fractured that myth by emphasizing poverty. Why is it so important for struggling people to understand themselves as poor or working class?

﻿This campaign is being built from the bottom up. It is poor people, impacted people saying it’s time for us to unite together and transform the reality that they do not have to be. And they were the ones that told us we need to make this clear: that in this nation, a nation that gives trillions of dollars of tax cuts to benefit 75,000 or 100,000 people, there are also 140 million poor and low-wealth people. Some of them are three- or four-hundred dollars from pure economic destruction. Many of them are also living on the street.

One of the problems with the polling is that the polling operates in a narrative that oftentimes uses the government numbers for poverty and not the actual number for poverty that we use in our empirical data study called “The Souls of Poor Folk.” Also, over the years, poverty has been racialized so badly that some people tend to resist the category of poverty.

But a lot of the polls, they haven’t been the places we go, in the hills of Kentucky where people are very clear that they are poor and low-wealth. Or in the Delta of Mississippi. And they are not ashamed of being poor. They are ashamed of a country that continues to push policies that create poverty. Poverty is not, for them, something that they have created because of their lack of initiative. You know, we talk about the working poor, as if the rest of poor folk aren’t doing anything. The problem is not a lack of morality, it is a fractured and broken system that tends to lean itself toward the middle-class and the wealthy. When we even have political discussions, since 1968 and 1969, we have had the Republicans racializing poverty and Democrats running from poverty. Even the word “poverty” has almost been removed from the political discourse. In 2016, there were 26 presidential debates. Not one was about poverty.

Trump is very good, obviously, at pitting people against each other in a way that is heavily racialized. But the Poor People’s Campaign is a multiracial coalition. That really presents another way of being, doesn’t it?

﻿It really does. To understand Trump you almost have to step away from him and understand the Southern Strategy that began in 1968 as the attacks on the war against poverty were beginning to work and King had been killed. What you have is an assassination of a movement. You also have at that time Strom Thurmond, Lee Atwater, and other people distinctly decide that we’re going to push racial division, and we’re going to use three or four tactics. Number one, we’re not going to use the very inflammatory words, politically. We’re not going to use the N-word. We’re going to talk about things like tax cuts and forced busing as a states’ rights issue, and the danger of entitlement. And we’ve got to create a narrative that basically blames poor people, especially black and brown poor people, for everybody else’s problems.

They called it positive polarization and they knew it could drive a wedge. Dr. King said in 1965 on the steps of an Alabama courthouse that this tactic had been used all the way back in the 1800s, that every time black and white poor people had the potential to create a political base that could transform the country, the racist aristocracy would always sow division. So the segregation of society was created as a way to undermine a power that could reset economic justice in this country. I like to give that history because Trump is the recipient of years and years of this kind of division.

I want to talk about religion for a second. The Christian right is in power right now, and for decades, they’ve heavily influenced the way we talk about values and morality. What does the religious left have to offer here?

﻿So first of all, the practice of religion used in the service of oppression, injustice, racism, and economic denial is as old as the country. It’s not new, it’s slaveholder religion.

I can say that I’m a theologically conservative liberal, Evangelical Pentecostal Biblicist. Basically, I’m a Christian. But what does it mean to be a left Christian, or a right Christian? It’s not like both have equal moral standing. It’s not conservative versus liberal. It’s right versus wrong.

It is indisputable that in the Christian and Hebrew Bible, there are more than 2,500 scriptures that talk about the responsibility of people of faith to challenge the nations, to deal with the issue of poverty, the sick, the children, protect the women and to welcome the immigrant. Indisputable. As a Christian, it is indisputable that Jesus began his ministry with good news to the poor.

Part of what we are doing in this movement with people of faith from every different direction is saying, we’re no longer going to sit back and allow Christian nationalism, so-called white Evangelicalism, to dominate. To suggest that if you’re against abortion, you’re against women’s right to choose, you’re for guns, for prayer in schools, for tax cuts, a Republican, then you have taken the moral position, that is modern-day heresy. And we have to challenge it. But we’re not just going to challenge it just emotionally. We’re saying if you want to have a discussion about morality from a Biblical standpoint, then let’s have a real one.

What do you think poor people need that they aren’t currently getting from their elected representatives in either party?

One thing is, in this country, if you’re not in the narrative, you’re not going to be in the policy. So we’ve said to each presidential candidate, will you commit to demanding that we have full, open debates to talk about the need to address the moral crisis and the economic crisis of poverty and the injustices that interlock with it?

We have to change our whole narrative. Seven people die from vaping, and it’s a national emergency. Columbia University says 200,000 people die each year from poverty and it’s not a national emergency? One person is shot by a racist cop and we get in the street and we should, but almost 5,000 people die for every 1 million people that do not have health care, according to a study at Harvard, and there’s no outrage. That has to change.

Poor and low-wealth people are seeing the need to galvanize themselves around an agenda, not a party, not a person, but an agenda. They are that sleeping giant, if you will, the power base that could reset American politics right now. Forty-three percent of this nation is not being discussed or talked about. For instance, if you run the table in the south from Virginia to Texas, you end up with about 168, 170 electoral votes. Thirteen states. And yet all 13 are high-poverty states. Denial of health-care states, voter-suppression states. What happens if a movement is able to help people see how they’re being played against each other? You could reset the entire political calculus. And that’s where I think that party politics has missed it, with this constant conversation about the middle-class and welfare and writing off 140 million low-income and low-wealth people. Forty-three percent of this nation is not being discussed or talked about.

Why do you think that parties are writing off poor and low-wealth people?

﻿Republicans tend to racialize it. It plays into their racial narrative. They flip back, and say to poor whites, “You’re poor because we’re over here trying to help these people.” That’s the philosophy around so-called entitlements and why they need to be reformed or stopped, because it was breaking the nation and holding it back: All these poor people over here, i.e. black and brown people, i.e. people who are lazy, it’s their fault. That disables a real conversation about poverty.

And then on the Democratic side, somebody has spooked them. I don’t know what in the world has happened. I don’t understand how you come from the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson and now you’re scared of addressing the issue of poverty. Their consultants or whoever has told them, “Don’t say the word poverty.” And so they come up with all of these, I won’t call them innuendos, but all of these ways of trying to say “poverty” without actually saying the word. They talk about “the working poor.” Or people “struggling to afford the American dream.” People who are “trying to get up.” No, some folk are just poor!

Do you think there’s a lack of a sense of urgency?

﻿Yes. It could be fixed quickly. There are things we could do. Marian Wright Edelman said we could take 2 percent of the federal budget and put it toward programs that we know work, and eradicate 60 percent of child poverty. We could raise the minimum wage to $15 immediately, and bam, 30 million people would be raised up to a living wage.

Elizabeth Warren, I thank God for her, but I wish her, Bernie, any of them would have started out not with “here’s my plan to fix it and how much it will cost.” Flip the question. What will it cost us not to fix it?

How have movements like Fight for 15 and Red for Ed, the teachers strike movement, helped drive this point home, that we ought to discuss poverty more openly?

﻿Yeah. In fact, the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina helped to set the framework for Fight for 15. I’ve been involved with Fight for 15 from the get out, the first national speaker. But they also learned from the tactics of Moral Monday. You have to raise the issue, keep it in front of the people. So, yes, Fight for 15 and other movements are critical.

So we support and endorse many movements. We have now 15 so religious groups and denominations. We have people that are not necessarily people of faith. In addition to the three coordinated committees in 43 states and the District of Columbia, we have about 120 or so other organizations involved. And it’s not about them coming under one person’s leadership. It’s fusion organizing. This is coalition.

So it’s solidarity?

﻿Even more than solidarity. It’s the sense that I’m not gonna allow people to give me a victory here while I write you off over there. So when we go in a place like, say, eastern Kentucky in Appalachia, I don’t change what I say about race there. That’s what politicians do. I don’t do that. I say y’all, let’s do something. And we put up maps. And we say, now in West Virginia, you have voter suppression, and we put that map up. And then we say, did you also know in West Virginia you have a high level of poverty. We’ll do child poverty. Then we’ll do women in poverty, then we do the denial of health care, then we do denial of living wages, denial of union rights, denial of LGBTQ rights, denial of women’s rights. And then we step back and say, do you see the thing about this national map? The same states that do the race thing are doing this to you too.

And I had one white guy in Appalachia who stood up and said, “DAMN!” I’m not being facetious. He said, “Reverend Barber, they’ve been playing us.” And I said that’s right. We were there in Kentucky, and some people told us not to go to Harlan County. Harlan County, where Justice Harlan came from, the only Supreme Court justice that voted against Plessy v. Ferguson. Harlan County, where Lyndon B. Johnson started the War on Poverty. Democrats hadn’t been to Harlan County since I don’t know when. I mean, they just write it off. But we had 300 folk in the middle of the day turn out.

I went outside with one guy and he said, “I’m a McCoy.” I said, “What kind of McCoy?” He said again, “I’m a McCoy.” And then I said, “Yes sir, I understand.” He said, “We ready to fight.” I told him this is a nonviolent movement. He said, “I get it, but let me tell you, you’ve got a lot of friends up here.” I told him, “Wait a minute, people tell me this is Trump country. Why did folk vote for Trump?”

He said, “Look, we knew Trump was … ” and he used an expletive. He said, “Folks are hurting, and needed more attention, they want people to know.” Democrats haven’t been back here since Lyndon B. Johnson came back here. These hills are full of people who, if you came out here and talked to them and didn’t just write them off as ignorant and let them know you were serious about addressing the issue, even if you didn’t totally change the county, you could close the margins — i.e., what just happened.

Yes, that’s exactly what happened with the election of Andy Beshear.

﻿And what did the governor say that night? We never endorsed Beshear in the campaign. We endorse an agenda, we exposed the current government. [Matt] Bevin pushed back black folk from Louisville and white folk from eastern Kentucky when he wouldn’t let them come into the statehouse. And it went all over the news and people saw. We pushed an agenda that he resisted. And what did the new governor say when he accepted? He said this campaign is not about Democratic versus Republican, liberal versus conservative, right versus wrong. He actually gravitated to the language of the Poor People’s Campaign because he saw a movement — our campaign, and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth — bringing folk together. Two of the five or six counties we worked in heavily for a couple of years flipped.

It’s interesting that you say that, because we’ve heard a lot this election cycle about the notion of electability. People are afraid that certain candidates aren’t electable because they back policies like Medicare for All, or they’re talking about poverty, or they’re going after billionaire CEOs. What do you think of that conversation?

﻿I think that I’m always amazed by people who say that things are unelectable, people are unelectable. Nelson Mandela said that it’s always impossible until you do it. There’s a crowd that always says it’s impossible. Lincoln was unelectable. No one thought Franklin Roosevelt could get elected with polio. Half of all of the things we enjoy today, people a hundred years ago said was impossible. Medicaid. Living wage. The eight-hour workday.

What you have is almost a kind of lazy politics. It wants you to deny what you really believe or deny fighting for what’s right or deny the hard work of showing the American people. Now sure, if you do politics as we’ve been doing, a lot of things are impossible because there’s no real focus, no real conversation. But what if you change? What if you force the media and others into areas to see. What if America sees itself and understands how desperate things are? Do you believe that the conscience of this nation is so dim and so dark and so dull that people wouldn’t be moved? Because if that’s what you believe, then we have a problem bigger than our politics."

It’s an oldie but a goodie, and sometimes I marvel about the fact that any Democrat ever stops talking about it. Consider this from The Post’s Tory Newmyer:

AD

Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says the Trump cuts, whose second anniversary arrives this month, present a ripe target for Democrats to make the case the president has betrayed the populist pitch he made in 2016. She tells me focus groups she’s conducted with disaffected Trump voters reveal they are “really, really mad” about the corporate windfall the cuts yielded, “and a remarkable number of people know about companies like Amazon that aren’t paying any taxes.”

The public has misconceptions about a lot of things, but this is an area where they understand reality quite well. There has in fact been a huge increase in inequality in recent years. The rich do in fact manage to avoid paying what they should, and the richer they are, the better they are at avoiding taxes. The system is indeed rigged by and for the interests of corporations and the wealthy.

AD

Which is why, if you look at polling on the subject of taxes, huge majorities consistently say that the rich and corporations pay too little. In Pew polling, over 80 percent of people say they’re bothered by corporations and the wealthy not paying their fair share. In a Politico/Morning Consult poll, 76 percent say the rich should pay more.

The same goes for specific proposals. Take a wealth tax of the kind Elizabeth Warren has advocated. There are legitimate critiques you can make of it — it would be difficult to enforce without an enormous increase in IRS agents (which we need anyway, but that’s another story), there are other ways to get the revenue, and so on.

AD

But the fact remains that a wealth tax is hugely popular, with 60 percent or more of the public saying they support it.

Or a financial transaction tax on Wall Street, in which a small tax would be assessed every time a trade is made. A number of Democratic candidates support the idea, which according to this Brookings Institution analysis could raise up to $75 billion a year; 75 percent of the burden would fall on the top income quintile, and 40 percent of the burden on the top 1 percent of taxpayers.

AD

Again, there are arguments you could make about whether there are more efficient ways to raise the same revenue from the wealthy or corporations. But one thing is for certain: Wall Street and the Trump administration react with horror at the idea. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this week that such a tax “would destroy our capital markets.”

AD

This is at a time when the Trump tax cut pushed profits of the banking industry to a record $237 billion in 2018, and the administration is gutting oversight of Wall Street. Isn’t that an argument Democrats would like to have?

Democrats don’t all agree on every specific proposal, which is fine. But they can all agree that the system has to be reoriented away from the interests of the wealthy and toward the interests of regular people, whether it’s in taxation or regulations or health care or education.

AD

What they don’t do often enough is talk about all those issues in these terms. Some candidates do, but it’s something all of them should do. It doesn’t matter if your tax plan is the one that hits the wealthy the hardest; you can still make an argument about inequality and unfairness in the system.

AD

Again and again in recent history, Democrats have left this incredibly potent set of arguments sitting on the shelf. They put out plans to raise taxes on the wealthy, but they don’t place this critique at the center of their campaigns. They don’t hammer it day in and day out. They allow someone like Trump to claim to be a populist.

And all it takes is someone saying, “Hey, didn’t you get some donations from people who work on Wall Street?” to make them clam up and change the subject.

But this argument is so effective because it resonates with people’s lives and what they see around them. It connects specific policy proposals to broader themes about what’s wrong with the system and how to change it, and whom Democrats and Republicans represent. And most revealingly, it’s the last thing any Republican ever wants to talk about.

That should be all the incentive Democrats need.

“You’re damn near as old as I am,” he told the former vice president. “You’re too old for the job. I’m 83, and I know damn well I don’t have the mental faculties I did 30 years ago.”

AD

Continuing to pick apart Biden’s campaign, the man said: You “sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing, to get access to the president.”

AD

“You’re selling access to the president, just like he was,” the voter added.

Biden called the voter “a damn liar” before moving closer to the man to continue pushing back on his accusations.

“And you want to check my shape, man, let’s do push-ups together here, man,” the former lawmaker said. “Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. Okay?”

This is not the first time Biden used language to communicate that he was stronger, tougher and more of a fighter than someone opposing him politically. In March 2018, the University of Miami College Democrats posted a video of Biden saying he would have wanted to fight President Trump in high school.

AD

“When a guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, ‘I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it’ and then said, ‘I made a mistake,’ ” Biden said according to the video posted on Facebook.

AD

“They asked me would I like to debate this gentleman, and I said, ‘No,’ ” he added. “I said, ‘If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.’""

When some of Biden’s competitors have shown aggression over policy issues, pundits criticized them and voters may have penalized them for it.

When former housing secretary Julián Castro went after Biden in a September debate for appearing not to remember a recent remark he made, Castro was called mean for appearing to make a jab at Biden’s age — especially after fact-checkers at The Post noted that Castro was incorrect when trying to explain the differences between the two candidates’ health-care plans.

AD

“It was a callow, nasty moment in a race in which many Democrats have been pleading with candidates not to attack one another,” wrote The Post’s Jennifer Rubin. “Everyone else seems to get it, but not Castro.”

AD

And according to those on the ground in Iowa, Castro is viewed by some voters in the state — many of them older and white — as angry when he goes after his opponents.

Explaining the preferences of older Iowa voters, Art Cullen, editor of the Storm Lake Times in northwestern Iowa, told the New York Times last month: “Castro kind of comes off with fangs every now and again.”

And when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) zeroed in on Biden early in the debates over his past policies on busing and the impact it had on children of color, she was penalized by some voters who deemed her approach too aggressive. After she ended her campaign, author and professor Howard Fineman cited the July incident, suggesting it contributed to her unpopularity with voters.

AD

“Another lesson from the demise of Kamala Harris: among voters who are Democrats, you don’t have to support Joe Biden, or even like him, but don’t attack him directly, especially face-to-face,” he tweeted Tuesday. “People are sort of fond of the old dude.”

AD

But the extent to which fondness manifests as privilege is another layer of the drawn-out conversation about “electability” and who is deemed presidential and not. Studies have shown that when women and people of color are confrontational in the workplace, they are penalized.

A 2008 Harvard study examining gender and emotion is expressed in the workplace found:

Displays of anger from men are often viewed as a response to external circumstances, (i.e. they were provoked), while displays of anger by women are more likely to be seen as an internal trait (I.e. she is an angry person).

In fact, one of Biden’s attacks against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.), the highest-polling woman in the presidential race, was that her critiques of his policy come from a place of anger — a description many critics viewed as highly gendered.

AD

After Warren suggested that Biden’s politics were too conservative for today’s Democratic Party, he wrote in a Medium post: “These kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.”

AD

And Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, found that black professionals often had to police their own emotions in the workplace out of fear of professional consequences. She previously wrote in the Atlantic:

In particular, black professionals had to be very careful to show feelings of conviviality and pleasantness, even — especially — in response to racial issues. They felt that emotions of anger, frustration, and annoyance were discouraged, even when they worked in settings where these emotions were generally welcomed in certain contexts — think litigators interacting with opposing counsel, or financial analysts responding to a stressful day on Wall Street. Interestingly, this often played out at trainings meant to encourage racial sensitivity.

Some defenders of Biden's interaction with the Iowa farmer — and even Warren — might argue that the former vice president was responding to unfair and inaccurate attacks. And as a result, he has a right to be angry and to respond as such. There's an idea that a “tough guy” is needed to defeat Trump.

AD

But the question to be considered on this issue is: Do other candidates get that same right? Would Harris be allowed to get in a voter’s face and call him a liar without consequence? Or would Castro be allowed to brag that he’d punch the president in the face and maintain his standing, were he a front-runner?

AD

Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 rival, certainly wasn’t allowed to appear angry without attracting criticism. After a debate, former GOP chairman Reince Priebus called her out on it on Twitter.

@HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time - no smile and uncomfortable - upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets. — Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016

These candidates are applying for a job. They hope to replace a president who many voters believe misbehaves in ways that his predecessor — America’s first black president — or his general-election opponent, the first woman to become a major party’s presidential nominee, never could.

But the group isn’t completely adrift. “We said if somehow this one doesn’t work out we’ll go with that one,” said Scott, who said they’ve been closely monitoring two other candidates. “We go deep into planning.”

Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next.

The California senator left the race after support and fundraising slumped — but after nearly 11 months she had amassed a well-regarded bounty of supporters, particularly among black Democrats.

AD

The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters.

AD

At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former vice president Joe Biden appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women.

The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.

“I don’t know who needs to hear this but stay the [expletive] away from the Harris field,” wrote Dvorsky on Twitter. “Of course you want them to work for you. They’re freaking amazing. And sad. And grieving. Sit all the way down. They know where you live. They’ll get back to. Or not.”

A spokesman for Harris didn’t reply to questions about whether she would endorse another candidate in the race.

AD

By 9 a.m. Wednesday, less than a day after Harris’s surprise departure became public, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign announced he had won the endorsement of Mitch Henry, a key Iowa figure who had been a member of Harris’s Iowa Latinx steering committee.

In the hours after Harris left the race, everyone from her finance team, to a local South Carolina gun control activist to members of Congress who had sided with her were hearing pitches.

AD

Four campaigns — and one presidential candidate — reached out to Iowa state Rep. Ross Wilburn of Ames within 24 hours of Harris leaving the race.

“It was just offers of support, one or two with more of a pointed ‘here’s what my candidate brings to the table,’ ” Wilburn said, adding that he received a call from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and campaign officials representing former vice president Joe Biden, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and Sens. Warren and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

AD

Other Harris supporters also were girding for a full-court press from candidates, with Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, warning the white candidates not to “pander.”

AD

“What have you done in the past that will give me an indication of what you will do in the future for people of color?” Fudge asked, explaining what she wants to hear. “A lot of people have great plans. But if you put a plan together without the input of the very people you say you want to help, that is just as pandering to me as anything else.”

“We like Warren. We like Sanders. We like Biden. We like our neighbor in South Bend,” said another caucus member, Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.), referring to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of the Indiana city. “We’re just deciding which one we like the most at the moment.”

AD

During her campaign, Harris didn’t fit neatly into a particular ideological lane, meaning that there was no single obvious beneficiary of her departure.

AD

In South Carolina, some observers assume much of Harris’s support could go to Biden, who already is well known among African Americans there.

But Warren also is positioned to benefit, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a group trying to elevate women of color in American politics.

“She’s been focusing on intersectional policies that directly address race and gender,” Allison said. “Warren and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders are beneficiaries of the latest dynamic.”

Many of Harris’s donors were already looking elsewhere. Roughly half of more than 100 well-connected fundraisers who raised at least $25,000 for Harris’s campaign also gave the maximum donation to some of her Democratic rivals, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.

AD

AD

Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic donor, jumped on board with Harris shortly after her campaign launched in Oakland in January. But later, Buell also supported Buttigieg.

When asked about Harris’s campaign shortly before she dropped out of the race, Buell said in a text message: “Sad that Kamala didn’t do better but she wasn’t ready.”

Buell added on Wednesday that she is now fully backing Buttigieg: “I am seeing his effective, creative campaign as a symbol of his leadership qualities. The energy and focus in the campaign is very positive and impressive.”

The ultimate fight will be for the individual voters who backed Harris, including people like Vanessa Phelan, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mother of two from Des Moines.

Not long after Harris dropped out, texts started to come in from organizers of other campaigns. “It was, like, ‘Not today Satan,’ ” she said.

Phelan said she will eventually settle on another candidate but isn’t sure when. The hardest part of Harris’s decision to quit, she said, was explaining it to her 4-year-old daughter Zoe.

“Kamala ran out of money,” Phelan told her.

The little girl looked at her mother with wide eyes, trying to understand. “I’ll give Kamala my piggy bank,” her mother recalled Zoe saying. “I want her to be president.”

Wouldn’t the candidate who at one point earned the support of more than 46 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in 2016 be well positioned four years later? Particularly given the size of the field, locking down a big chunk of the electorate could be a huge advantage.

Polling of the 2020 race has indeed shown remarkably stability in Sanders’s numbers, as one might expect from someone with an enduring base — but not particularly strong support. Sanders’s standing in the polls has ranged over only 10 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average, a smaller range than any of the five candidates who at some point hit at least 10 percent in that average.

On 70 percent of days over the past year, Sanders’s poll average has been between 15 and 18 percent.

The question, then, is who that 15 to 18 percent of the electorate is. Which groups have stuck with Sanders four years after his first bid?

AD

AD

To answer that question, we pulled Washington Post-ABC News polling from September 2015 (when he was still a long shot), March 2016 (when he was closing in on Clinton) and our poll released in early November. We have comparable data for a number of demographic groups, including age, gender, ideology, race, education and income.

Here’s support for Sanders by demographic in all three polls. The numbers show the change in support from the group from the 2015 or 2016 poll until the one released last month. What we’re looking for are places where support dropped a lot — or not much at all.

Almost uniformly, the drops from the March 2016 poll are dramatically larger than the drops from the September 2015 poll, a reflection of the surge Sanders saw as he became the sole viable alternative to Clinton. It suggests, though, that his support at that point was largely a function of his position in the race; that they didn’t become part of his political base.

AD

AD

Two demographic groups in particular stand out. One is nonwhite Democratic voters, a group that was a significant factor in his 2016 loss. Sanders’s support in primaries correlated inversely to the density of black voters, and Clinton’s delegate lead was largely a function of her dominating in heavily black states. In our November poll, he does 9 points better with nonwhites than he did four years earlier. Important caveat: The margin of sampling error for the group is 8.5 percent, so this may just be noise.

The other group that sticks out is whites with a college degree. Sanders’s support with that group dropped significantly from September 2015 until now. (It’s probably a big reason his support with whites overall similarly dropped.) Back then, Sanders did much better with whites without a degree than with those who had a degree, in part because his support has consistently skewed younger. (Note that his support among younger voters is now about what it was in September 2015, while his support with people over 50 has dropped.)

In our November poll, we see where those whites with college degrees went: to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Those 50 and over went to former vice president Joe Biden.

Of course, Sanders still leads with young people, if we consider people under 50 as uniformly “young.” (We should, in my humble, not-old opinion.) There are four groups where Sanders earned more than 20 percent support both four years ago and in November: people under 50, men, those making less than $50,000 a year and liberals. However, his support among liberals dropped 7 points (within the margin of error). Warren led with that group in our most recent poll.

AD

AD

In other words, Sanders’s base now appears to be mostly what it was four years ago, with the exception of college-educated whites. That group, of course, is central to the candidacy of a Democrat who was barely known four years ago: Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.

Take Buttigieg and Warren out of the race, and it would be interesting to see where Sanders lands. Perhaps the most likely place? In a one-on-one contest against a more moderate Democrat with strong black support.

In other words, he’d end up in familiar territory.

President Trump's pro-Wall Street record will leave him little room on the campaign trail next year to reprise the anti-industry pose he struck in 2016.

That was in fresh evidence as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the onetime Goldman Sachs executive, appeared on Capitol Hill to defend the Trump administration’s deregulation of the financial services industry and criticize Democratic proposals to tax and scrutinize it.

Mnuchin spent most of his time before the House Financial Services Committee in the weeds of financial oversight. But the hearing also offered a preview of what Democratic strategists believe will be a potent line of attack to press against Trump on the campaign trail.

And at least one former Trump official agrees the president is vulnerable on this front. “There’s some truth to the idea that it would be smart for a Democrat nominee to focus on the closeness between the Trump White House and Goldman Sachs,” the former White House official tells me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. “That would be some inherently good messaging for Democrats to use.”

Mnuchin in his appearance offered a full-throated critique of a tax on financial transactions embraced by some Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. And the Treasury secretary faced sharp questions from Democrats about the administration’s moves to shrink the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the post-crisis board charged with coordinating the federal government’s regulation of the financial system.

Mnuchin said the Treasury Department is working to study the impact of the potential financial transactions tax. “I am very concerned that that would destroy our capital markets, and the cost to American holders of mutual funds would bear the majority of the cost,"" Mnuchin said.

But it likely will remain a popular concept on the campaign trail: A version introduced by congressional Democrats would raise an estimated $777 billion over a decade, a considerable sum for the party’s White House hopefuls looking to fund pricey social welfare expansions while reining in the industry.

To be sure, not all Democratic presidential candidates are embracing a financial transactions tax. But even former vice president Joe Biden, arguably the field’s moderate pacesetter, is pushing a tax plan that would mean a significantly higher burden for big banks. His plan, released this week, would bump the corporate rate up from 21 percent to 28 percent, effectively halving the windfall the industry reaped from Trump’s tax cuts.

Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says the Trump cuts, whose second anniversary arrives this month, present a ripe target for Democrats to make the case the president has betrayed the populist pitch he made in 2016. She tells me focus groups she’s conducted with disaffected Trump voters reveal they are “really, really mad” about the corporate windfall the cuts yielded, “and a remarkable number of people know about companies like Amazon that aren’t paying any taxes.” (To that end, Biden is proposing a 15 percent minimum corporate tax.)

Lake says going after the failed promise of the tax cuts could become “a very powerful component” of a broader case against the president’s coziness with corporate interests. Another focus group of Trump voters — conducted in Michigan’s swing Macomb County by Democracy Corps, a project by Democratic strategists James Carville and Stanley Greenberg — struck on the framing back in March 2017. From that report:

“When his cabinet is described as full of campaign donors, Goldman Sachs bankers (bailed out by the taxpayers) and people who use undocumented workers in their homes, they question whether this is the Donald Trump they voted for. “That right there seems to be two-faced,” and Trump is now “just the puppet” doing what Goldman Sachs want. Most important, this means they won’t get the changes they wanted and it’s possible “we’re in for another four or possibly eight years of the same old same old.”

But the former White House official argued not all Democratic candidates are on the same footing when it comes to challenging Trump’s Wall Street advocacy. Trump, he said, can lean into his trade wars — anathema to C-suites and Wall Street — to argue his populist credentials are intact if he’s running against a more moderate, trade-friendly Democrat. “Both sides are going to attempt versions of the same argument against the other,” he said. But “Sanders will have a better time making the argument against Trump than a Biden or [South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete] Buttigieg.”

— November jobs numbers ahoy. The Wall Street Journal's Sarah Chaney notes what to watch out for in today's report: ""Watch for a bounceback in employment last month as General Motors Co. workers, who were on strike in October, returned to work. Employment in auto manufacturing fell by more than 40,000 in October because of the strike. Economists expect the return of GM strikers to help drive November job growth to 187,000, from 128,000 in October...

""Friday’s report is expected to show the November unemployment rate remained at 3.6%, in line with October. The jobless rate has logged in at or below 4% for 20 straight months, the longest such stretch since the 1960s. The historically low rate is a sign that most workers who want a job can land one. The question now is how much further unemployment can fall.""

""Saudi Aramco said it had set the initial share price at 32 riyals, or about $8.53, the high end of the range it forecast last month. It plans to sell three billion shares, 1.5 percent of the company. At that price, the company would be worth $1.7 trillion.

— Trade deficit shrinks: “The U.S. trade deficit dropped to its lowest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in October, suggesting trade could contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter, though a broad decline in imports hinted at a slowdown in domestic demand,” Reuters’s Lucia Mutikani reports.

“Still, consumer spending is likely to remain supported by a strong labor market. Other data … showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, hitting their lowest level in seven months. The reports countered data this week showing manufacturing activity contracting for a fourth straight month in November, a slowdown in growth in the services sector as well as a drop in construction spending in October.”

— Where have we heard this before? Oh, right ...: “China’s trade negotiations with the U.S. remain on track, Beijing said, offering official reassurance after tensions flared between the world’s two biggest economies over human-rights issues in China,” the Wall Street Journal’s Grace Zhu, Eva Dou and Bob Davis report.

“The negotiating teams from both sides have maintained close communications, China’s Commerce Ministry said ... though it didn’t provide details on progress. The recent strain had spooked investors and stoked concerns about the global economic outlook.”

The U.S. is not as optimistic (again): “During the past few days, though, officials in the U.S. have become less optimistic about a deal. The two nations remain at odds over the value of U.S. farm goods Beijing would buy, with [Trump] looking for $40 billion to $50 billion a year within two years.”

— Canada’s trade surplus is a work of art: “New York’s art scene is suddenly skewing Canada’s trade balance with the U.S.,” Bloomberg News’s Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg report.

“A shipment of paintings and sculptures potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars helped drive an increase in exports in October, Statistics Canada said … That resulted in the northern nation’s widest surplus with its biggest trading partner since the 2008 financial crisis … Canadian trade data is often skewed by high-value items. The import of an expensive piece of machinery for an offshore oil project in 2016 led to one of Canada’s biggest ever trade deficits with the world.”

“‘Warning of “uncharted territory,’ Trump asked the court for the second time to review rulings from lower courts that have said Congress and state prosecutors have a right to review his personal and business records … The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider a related case at its private conference Dec. 13. It involves a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that granted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. similar access to Trump’s financial records, which are held by his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA. The company has said it will comply with final court orders.”

— The U.S. tax burden is now one of the lowest in the world: “Trump’s 2017 tax cuts reduced the U.S. tax burden to one of the lowest among major world economies, according to a … report by an intergovernmental organization,” the WSJ’s Richard Rubin reports.

“U.S. tax burdens dropped by the largest amount among those countries in 2018, and the U.S. now has lower taxes than all but three countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the report said … Measured as a share of the U.S. economy, taxes are now 10 percentage points below the 2018 OECD average of 34.3 percent. Among 34 countries with preliminary 2018 data, the U.S. tax burden is lower than everywhere except Chile, Ireland and Mexico. The tax cut drove U.S. taxes below Turkey’s, and taxes in France and Denmark are now nearly twice what they are in the U.S.”

“The state-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Co., commonly known as Aramco, said it would sell 3 billion shares, or a 1.5% stake of the company, at 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53), or at the top of the targeted range of 30 to 32 riyals for a total of $25.6 billion.

""The remarks represented a departure from Warren’s previous unwillingness to publicly chide most of her top-tier primary opponents, and came as Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in some polls in Iowa, the first state to hold a nominating contest next year. 'I think that Mayor Pete should open up the doors so that anyone can come in and report on what’s being said,' Warren told reporters in Boston. 'Those doors shouldn’t be closed, and no one should be left to wonder what kind of promises are being made to the people that then pony up big bucks to be in the room.'""

Buttigieg's team fires back:

""Yet Buttigieg’s time at the world’s most prestigious management-consulting company is one piece of his meticulously programmed biography that he mentions barely, if at all, on the campaign trail. As Buttigieg explains it, that is not a matter of choice. For all of his efforts to run an open, accessible campaign — marked by frequent on-the-record conversations with reporters on his blue-and-yellow barnstorming bus — McKinsey is a famously secretive employer, and Buttigieg says he signed a nondisclosure agreement that keeps him from going into detail about his work there. But as he gains ground in polls, his reticence about McKinsey is being tested, including by his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.""

There's little chance that impeachment will remove President Trump from office. But one Wall Street strategist notes that it could complicate his reelection path.

Economic forecasters have predicted that Trump should cruise to a second term next year given the strength of the economy. But a new analysis from JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that the onslaught of coverage of impeachment and Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is drowning out the positive economic news he needs to win.

The dynamic highlights the challenge facing the White House as it pursues a split-screen strategy depicting Trump as focused on his agenda while congressional Democrats press ahead with impeachment.

Michael Cembalest, JPMorgan Asset Management's chairman of market and investment strategy, lays out the quandary facing Trump in a pair of charts. First, Cembalest crunched a raft of data to conclude Trump is heading into the 2020 campaign with the strongest economic tail winds going back to 1896.

The measures blended more than a century of readings on consumer price inflation, the jobless rate, the change in that rate, per capita economic growth, how that growth compares to that of other leading economies, stock market returns, and home price appreciation, among others:

But viewers tuning into primetime CNN and MSNBC from 8 to 10 p.m. over a year-long period ending in September saw barely a blip about positive economic developments. Instead, the Mueller investigation and Russian interference in the 2016 election overwhelmingly dominated those airwaves, followed by coverage of Trump’s personal conduct in office, then immigration issues, then administration corruption:

Trump critics will contend the president has earned that coverage through his behavior, while he merely inherited an economic expansion that has mostly continued apace. Cembalest mostly agrees: “Trump deserves the coverage he’s getting from those news outlets,” he tells me.

But he wrote the note to illustrate something he observed in his own home: His wife, a devoted MSNBC watcher, hears a version of the news that bears little resemblance to what he sees all day studying market and economic indicators. The divide both fuels and is fueled by a broader Balkanization of the electorate that suggests the traditional relationship between the economy's performance and the president’s political fortunes may be breaking down.

By matching historical economic data to presidential election outcomes, economists at Moody’s Analytics, Oxford Economics and Trend Macrolytics have all projected Trump will secure reelection more easily than his first win, barring a serious economic downturn. But the more relevant point of comparison may be 2018. An analysis Cembalest conducted after the election found that measured against the strength of the economy, Republicans suffered the worst midterm losses by a president’s party in at least a century.

The finding could reframe Trump’s political incentives in waging his trade war. Conventional wisdom has held the president keeps up the fight at his own peril, since it remains arguably the greatest menace to continued economic growth.

But if he can galvanize his base by stoking confrontation with the Chinese — and that outweighs whatever economic costs it brings — it may be in Trump’s interest to keep putting off a deal. “I think that’s true up to a point,” Cembalest says, arguing if the president goes forward with December 15 tariffs heavily targeting consumer goods, ""I think he’d lose them, because the global recession that could result would offset the benefits from the base. He has to figure out how to conduct the trade war” with lower stakes.

Some support for the theory comes from across the Atlantic. “Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, both of Bocconi University in Milan, study election results in 15 European countries,” per The Economist. “They find that areas facing greater competition from Chinese imports were more likely to vote for nationalist parties.”

More from that piece, titled ""Does the economy affect elections anymore?"": “The old straightforward relationship between the economic cycle and elections could yet return. But the implication of the new research is that support for populism is a deeper-rooted feature of Western economies… Voters care less than they used to about the economy's immediate impact on their wallets. But they care more than ever about how the economy shapes their identity--their sense of security, and their freedom.”

MARKET MOVERS

— Growth stumbles for services sector, private payrolls. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: ""U.S. services sector activity slowed in November as lingering concerns about trade tensions and worker shortages pushed production to its lowest level in a decade, which could heighten fears about the economy’s health. Other data on Wednesday showed private employers hired the fewest workers in six months in November. The reports came on the heels of data on Monday showing manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November and a decline in construction spending in October.

""The continued manufacturing slump and second straight monthly drop in construction outlays tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter, which had been boosted by a rush of upbeat reports on the trade deficit, housing and business investment. Still, the economy appears to be growing at a moderate pace rather than stalling.""

— Stocks snap losing streak. MarketWatch's Andrea Riquier: ""U.S. stocks closed higher for the first time in four sessions following a report that a phase-one trade U.S.-China trade deal was still in the works, helping to offset fears of a delay sparked a day earlier by [Trump’s] remarks.

""U.S. stock-index benchmarks recovered some of the week’s lost ground after Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar, reported that Beijing and Washington were making progress toward a phase-one trade pact. The comments also helped to provide a lift to European equities.""

— More S&P 500 companies face an earnings squeeze. WSJ's Akane Otani: ""Investors who have shrugged off tepid earnings growth this year have leaned on the argument that the majority of S&P 500 companies have wound up beating analysts’ expectations. Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management unit isn’t sold on that argument.

""The money manager found in an analysis of earnings that more than a third of S&P 500 companies have posted a year-over-year decline in earnings in 2019. The last times the share of companies posting contracting earnings was that high: 2009, 2008 and 2002, all periods when the broader economy, plus the stock market, were in decline.

— Mnuchin warns of issues with global tax rewrite: “The U.S. has ‘serious concerns’ with proposals being discussed in the global rewrite of corporate tax rules, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as he introduced a new idea that could complicate a deal over adapting the tax system for the digital economy,” the Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin and Paul Hannon report.

“In a letter to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Mr. Mnuchin cited concerns raised by U.S. businesses. He said that changing the mandatory rules for when countries have the right to tax companies could affect ‘longstanding pillars of the international tax system upon which U.S. taxpayers rely’ … Nevertheless, Mr. Mnuchin’s reservations come as a surprise given that the broad outlines of new rules agreed to in October were based on ideas advanced by the U.S., which has long pushed for measures that cover all companies, not just those whose businesses are highly digital.”

Neal said rank-and-file Democrats would be briefed on the details of the talks later in the day.

“The contract, valued at up to $10 billion over 10 years, was awarded to Microsoft in October, and Amazon has formally challenged the Pentagon’s decision, filing a protest with the Court of Federal Claims last month that cites comments by President Trump as indicating bias against Amazon.

“The dispute relates to the October 2014 restructuring that took place after the former Fiat SpA purchased the final part of its Chrysler unit, according to company filings and an Oct. 22 audit report seen by Bloomberg. The purchases stretched over five years and culminated in the full takeover of the once-bankrupt owner of brands such as Dodge, Ram and Jeep.”

“After an unsuccessful objection from his lawyer, Musk told the jury he has Tesla stock, and SpaceX stock, with debt against those holdings, and his net worth is about $20 billion. But contrary to public opinion, he said, he didn’t have much cash. Musk finished testifying after a total of about six hours on the stand over two days.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)

— Biden releases $3.2 trillion tax plan: “Former vice president Joe Biden released a plan to raise $3.2 trillion in taxes over 10 years to pay for his domestic spending proposals, including on health care and climate, as he seeks to cast himself as the fiscal moderate in the Democratic presidential primary amid pressure from his liberal rivals,” my colleague Jeff Stein reports.

“Biden’s plan calls for raising the tax rate paid by corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent, still below the 35 percent level in place before the 2017 GOP tax cut law. He also plans to raise $800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors, as well as $400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes, among other measures … The federal government is projected to bring in $3.8 trillion in revenue in 2021, so Biden’s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year.”

How it compares: “The plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, highlights the fissures in the Democratic primary by stopping short of many more-aggressive tax measures pitched by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For example, Warren and Sanders have proposed more than $20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, at least six times as much as Biden’s. Biden, for instance, rejects the liberals’ calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Sanders, made waves this year by calling for a 70 percent tax rate on top earners.”

The fight over Harris’s donors has begun: Sen. Kamala Harris’s “most affluent fundraisers, spanning from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, have been receiving calls and emails from people close to top-tier candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker. These people are hoping to snag the support of the bundlers and their donor networks,” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz reports.

Warren trolls Bloomberg on Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren accused former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg of trying to buy the 2020 election with millions of dollars in advertising to fuel his late entry into the Democratic race,” Bloomberg’s Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou and Joe Weisenthal report.

“Warren delivered her message in an interview on Bloomberg Television from the company’s headquarters in New York City. ‘I don’t believe that elections ought to be for sale,’ Warren said. ‘And I don’t think as a Democratic Party that we should say that the only way you’re going to get elected, the only way you’re going to be our nominee, is either if you are a billionaire or if you’re sucking up to billionaires.’”

That wasn’t all: Before the interview, Warren bought an ad to air on the network that directly attacked its owner-turned-candidate:

Warren proposes crackdown on bank mergers. NYT's Jeanna Smialek: ""Warren plans to introduce a bill in coming weeks that would intensify the scrutiny of bank mergers, a signal less of legislative action to come than of her intentions for the finance industry if she is elected president.

""The bill, a companion of which will be introduced Wednesday in the House by Representative Jesús 'Chuy' García, Democrat of Illinois, will almost certainly go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. But its argument that the 'review process for bank mergers is fundamentally broken' indicates that Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, still has the financial industry in her sights.""

New Georgia senator is ready to cut a big check to her campaign: “Soon-to-be Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler plans to spend $20 million of her own money on her 2020 Senate campaign in Georgia — a massive sum that could give potential rivals pause about trying to unseat her,” Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports.

“Loeffler, a wealthy financial executive and co-owner of Atlanta’s WNBA team, was tapped Wednesday morning to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who is resigning later this month due to health problems, on an interim basis. She has told advisers in recent days of her intentions to tap her vast fortune to win next year's special election to complete Isakson's term, according to a person with direct knowledge of the decision.”

Loeffler is heavily connected to Bitcoin: “Loeffler has been the chief executive of Bakkt, the Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin-focused subsidiary, since the entity’s announcement in August 2018,” Coindesk’s Nikhilesh De reports. “Under her tenure, the company rolled out its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts earlier this year.

By Andre Perry

At a campaign rally in Atlanta for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a day after the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, dozens of charter school supporters interrupted Warren’s speech to protest the presidential candidate’s plan to curb charter school growth. The New York Times reported the protesters were members of the Freedom Coalition for Charter Schools, an alliance of black and Latino education leaders, who toted signs that read “Charter schools = self-determination,” and “Black Democrats want charters!”

AD

AD

Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, a black lawmaker and Warren surrogate, threw the presidential candidate a life preserver. “We are grateful for your activism and your voice, and you are welcome here,” Pressley told the activists. But she also made it very clear that Warren’s voice would not be silenced.

It was, once again, an example of black leaders rushing to the rescue. Oddly enough, the charter activists and Pressley were both coming to the defense of white-led causes that could stand more vigorous feedback from black people. Because Democrats have to earn the black vote in black cities, the black community has leverage to demand that our concerns be addressed.

Warren needs to learn from black voices — but the charter school movement is not ours to defend.

AD

Organizations such as the charter school advocacy group Families for Excellent Schools have orchestrated statewide campaigns using dark money to influence state ballots to increase the number of charter schools, hiding who’s actually behind the movement. The Associated Press reported in December 2018 that an advocacy group that received $1.5 million from the Walton Family Foundation, one of the biggest funders of education reform, paid for 150, mostly black parents from Memphis to travel to Cincinnati two years prior to protest at a meeting of the NAACP. The parents sought to lobby against an NAACP proposal — which the organization passed despite the protests — to call for a moratorium on charter schools. They denied that the Walton Family Foundation asked them to carry out the protest.

AD

This political season, black people cannot afford to be human shields for white leaders who don’t have the legitimacy to enter black communities on their own.

Democrats vying for the presidency have mostly backed off from endorsing charter schools, a reversal of the party position, which has largely supported these publicly financed, independently run schools since the Clinton administration. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, two leading Democratic presidential candidates who represent the progressive wing of the party, have been the most aggressive in their proposals to curb the growth of charter schools.

AD

Warren’s K-12 education proposal would eliminate the Federal Charter School Program, which provides financial resources to start charter schools. And, if elected, she has promised to ban for-profit charter schools outright. Sanders would freeze all federal funding to charters. The Democratic Party now poses the biggest existential threat to the charter school sector.

AD

This reversal of position by Democrats is a sign that members of the party are listening to black communities.

After more than 25 years of charter development, it's almost cliché to say that the research is mixed on charter schools' academic benefits as measured by standardized test scores. At best, advocates can say there are specific charter networks that generate higher academic outcomes. There are exceptionally good and bad charter schools, just as there are exceptionally good and bad non-charter public schools, which isn’t saying much about the efficacy of chartering as a solution. If we are to embrace charter schools politically, they better bring additional benefits to black communities. And this is something charters have failed to do.

AD

Over the course of more than two decades, charter school expansion resulted in a significant loss in black-held jobs and a reduction in black political power in several black-majority cities. Black teachers were fired en masse in New Orleans, Washington D.C., and Newark, N.J., decimating the black middle class there.

AD

Hundreds of millions of dollars directed towards electing pro-charter candidates ultimately empowered Republicans in many states. The pro-charter group Students First realized that its funding of Republican candidates had backfired. The association of the charter cause with the Republic party lead to the defeat of pro-charter proposals. Democratic voters showed they will not support movements that bolster the Republican Party — the same party that refuses to check Trump’s blatant racism. Democrats who support the idea of charter schools should make it clear to Republicans that they will not tolerate a charter system that offers improved academic performance for some black students only by harming the communities in which those students live.

However, Democrat reformers developed a bad habit of accepting this Faustian bargain, and staying silent in red states on issues like jail expansion, cuts to higher education and attacks on organized labor because dissent ran the risk of slowing the proliferation of charters. Yes, black families want and need choice, but the current charter school movement is too tightly braided with Republican causes; a defense of one is a defense of the other.

AD

To embrace charter schools in 2020 is to embrace Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump and other Republicans who stand to gain more politically from charter support than black communities have gained in jobs and educational benefits. Black kids lose when Democratic educational reformers act like Republicans.

AD

The black community is split on charter schools, which have a 46 percent approval rating among black and brown parents, according to a poll conducted by the pro-reform magazine EducationNext. Maybe black people are divided because black leaders are too. For years black charter leaders have battled for support from a philanthropic apparatus that favored their white peers.

The funders of charter schools continuously put black parents and teachers in the position of fighting against their own interests. White-led philanthropy and education groups will eventually abandon public policy experiments when it is no longer popular, politically expedient or, in some cases, lucrative. For-profit charters are in education ostensibly for the money.

AD

Some black charter leaders feel they must defend the schools because black children attend them. But we don’t need to fall into that trap. We can defend black children and workers without defending charter schools. Black people need systemic change. We can’t allow the cry for charters to drown out the demands for school financing reform, better work conditions, higher teacher pay, universal pre-K, free college, teachers’ training and recruitment programs, stronger labor protections and workforce housing initiatives.

AD

The fight for charters is not about self-determination; it’s clearly about the sector’s survival. If we are going to bat for something, it should be something that gives us a lot more than a slow walk to first base.

We must stop cleaning up the political messes the charter school sector has created for Democrats and black communities. Black charter leaders certainly have a role to play in this election: They should continue to defend black lives. This time, let the charter lobby deal — on its own — with the mess it has made.

Moreover, she was friends with Biden’s deceased son Beau, a fellow state attorney general. One cannot help but think picking her as a running mate would strike a deep emotional cord with Biden.

Harris is one of those potential VP contenders who would help virtually any candidate — and not simply because the serious contenders who remain are all white and she is an African American woman. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg could use someone older, with inside-the-Beltway experience and a record on civil rights that would reassure many nonwhite voters. If she is on the ticket with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), she provides some appeal for progressives; on a ticket with the super-progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), she becomes the more moderate vice president, someone with appeal outside the niche of white, New England progressives.

AD

AD

In one sense, Harris’s perceived fuzziness on issues during her own campaign becomes a plus as a vice president who can easily adopt the positions of the top of the ticket. Her own policy positions are not set in stone and are therefore not likely to clash with a running mate.

Sure, Harris’s campaign failed, but few would argue that she lacked political skills, charisma, smarts and media prowess. As a vice presidential nominee, she would not be running the campaign; she would be on one that successfully navigated through a crowded field.

There is one more interesting scenario in which she may play a significant role. This cycle really is the one in which there is a reasonable chance no candidate will get a majority in the primaries, setting up a convention fight. Who wouldn’t want to have on his or her side someone part of the largest delegation (California), someone who racked up endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus and someone who can deliver a boffo political speech in a big arena?

There will be plenty of other VP contenders, including the rest of the nonwinning presidential candidates, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, both New Hampshire female U.S. senators (Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan) and female governors Gretchen Whitmer (Mich.), Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.) and Laura Kelly (Kan.), all three of whom were elected in 2018. Nevertheless, if you want to start handicapping the vice presidential pick, Harris probably should be at the top of the list.

ALLENDALE, S, C. — The Democrats in South Carolina's bluest county had laid out the welcome mat for Pete Buttigieg: a crowded headquarters, a soul food buffet, and praise for being the first 2020 Democrat to visit.

The next thing the South Bend, Ind., mayor got was skepticism.

“I hear a lot about how you don't have support from African Americans,” said Willa Jennings, the county Democratic chair. She turned to Sharon McBride, a black member of South Bend's city council who'd come to campaign with Buttigieg. “Could you tell us some of the things that Mayor Pete has done in South Bend to benefit the citizens in your city?”

It wasn't comfortable. It wasn't supposed to be. Buttigieg, who has surged in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire thanks to support from college-educated white voters, had put together a sort of Southern humility tour. A candidate breaking crowd-count records in small, white towns was holding small meet-and-greets in nonwhite ones.

“I know a lot of African American voters have felt not only kicked around by the Republican Party, but sometimes taken for granted by the Democratic Party that knows how to come to church just before an election but doesn't always come back and engage the community when it's most needed,” he explained. “I know that as somebody who's new on the scene, I've got to earn that trust.”

Sometimes he linked his life as a gay man and son of an immigrant to the experience of nonwhite voters. Sometimes, more self-effacingly, he admitted what he didn't know. In Allendale, where McBride called it a “myth” that Buttigieg had problems with black voters back home, Buttigieg said he was working to connect his own experience to theirs, if he only got the time.

“It's so important to me to earn the support of black voters,” Buttigieg said. “Now, if you were the last poll that came out, I think there were two candidates who had double-digit support among black voters. All the rest of us were in [single digits]. But I don't think that's permanent.”

That was a reference to a national Quinnipiac poll, which had shown Buttigieg surging to 23 percent with white voters, a lead, while winning just 4 percent of black voters. No other candidate polling in double digits overall had such a large racial support gap. His weakness with nonwhite voters has become a punchline from “Saturday Night Live” (“My supporters are a diverse coalition from young to old, gay to straight, white to eggshell”) to the Onion (“Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote”). And racial justice activists had piled on, with a protest breaking out at a pro-Buttigieg event in South Bend, and four immigrant rights groups demanding that he give back any donations from McKinsey employees after revelations about the consulting firm's work on deportation.

Buttigieg's monochrome appeal has made the campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden (the two candidates with double-digit support from black voters in that Quinnipiac poll) happier about his rise in Iowa. In their view, the mayor could kneecap Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has made some inroads with black and Latino voters and take over her “lane” with well-educated white voters, only to get pushed out in Nevada and South Carolina. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, one of the state's most prominent black politicians — the kind of pol, an ambitious mayor of a mid-sized city, who has gotten behind the mayor in other states — endorsed Mike Bloomberg days before Buttigieg's latest trip began. Even this week, as Buttigieg went on the air with a $2 million ad buy, supporters of Biden and Sanders dismissed his chances.

“He's a nonstarter; he's not going to scratch,” said Dick Harpootlian, a state senator and Biden supporter. “This is a guy who's been the mayor of a town not even as big as Columbia, who's got tremendous issues with race relations, who's abandoned his city to run for president. He's not got any sort of civil rights record that would engage African American voters. He's too young and too white.”

The mayor's low-key Southern tour put all of his troubles on display, as well as the different ways he has tried to tackle them — sometimes admitting his blind spots, sometimes sounding too eager to link his relatively privileged life to black and brown struggles.

On Sunday, after attending a service at the Rev. William Barber's church in North Carolina, Buttigieg admitted that he “worked for years under the illusion that our schools in my city were integrated because they had to be, because of a court order.” On Tuesday, at a roundtable with Latino voters, he mentioned that his own father came to America in the 1970s under the “lawful immigration process.” But the experience of a first-generation Maltese American didn't really resonate in the room.

“Part of the bigger issue that is affecting our communities is really that fear in trusting someone again, right?” said Fernando Soto, a DACA recipient and immigrant rights activist from Charleston. (He'd attended a previous meet-and-greet with Biden.) “The Latino community is very, very loyal. But we've been burned many times. And with the Obama administration, I would say that we were tokenized in order for that election to be won.”

Soto wanted Buttigieg to promise an immigration solution in his first term, which Buttigieg did before returning to his overall theory of politics. “If this White House really wanted to resolve immigration issues, they could do it; there's a bipartisan consensus, and then they could claim credit for the achievement,” Buttigieg said. “But they've made a decision not to. And I think that shows that the division is more useful to them than the issue. For my White House, the reverse would be true. We are depending on a more unified country.”

Without Biden's long record in the state, or Sanders's civil rights history, or Warren's detailed critique of discrimination, Buttigieg was often asking voters to see his sincerity. In Allendale and at the Latino forum in Okatie, voters most impressed by Buttigieg cited his military service as evidence that he understood nonwhite voters.

“When you sign up you meet people from all kinds of different backgrounds,” said Gustavo Gomez, 47, a Marine veteran, who’d asked Buttigieg about Puerto Rican representation in Congress. (Buttigieg favored changing that “sooner rather than later,” which Gomez appreciated.) “That helps you govern better.”

On Monday afternoon, Buttigieg took a tour of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, solemnly visiting a memorial to students killed in 1968 when protesting a segregated bowling alley, then bowling a round at the alley on campus — eight pins, then a strike. Two dozen students stopped by for free pizza and conversations, appreciating that Buttigieg would spend the time with them.

“He just did an endorsement video for my Instagram,” said Kayla Hasty, 21, who was running in a contest to pick the top 10 “kings and queens” of historically black colleges and universities. “You don't see many politicians doing that.” She remained undecided.

Charles C. Patton, Hasty's running mate, was in some ways less impressed. Buttigieg was not connecting with black voters, he said, when he linked his own life to the civil rights struggle. As a queer man, Patton found Buttigieg most compelling when he talked about LGBTQ rights, a subject he clearly knew inside out.

“I was happy to hear that he knows what's going on in our community, with black trans women, with LGBTQ youth, with homelessness,” said Patton. “That mattered to me. I like him. He's cool. I love his policies, but sometimes people don't have real awareness of how it affects people, and he has that.”

It was as strong a connection as Buttigieg had all day. After their conversation, Patton was considering a vote for Buttigieg — or Biden, or Warren.

DEBATE SEASON

There are just seven days left for Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to make the sixth Democratic debate. It’s not likely to happen.

To climb onto the Los Angeles debate stage, Booker would need to hit 4 percent in four polls, or 6 percent in two polls of the early-voting states. There may not be enough polls in the field right now, even if Booker were experiencing a dramatic surge in support. Which he isn’t.

That was the backdrop for Booker's Thursday morning speech in Iowa, a late edition to his schedule in the wake of Sen. Kamala D. Harris's exit from the presidential race, where he argued outright that nervous donors and shortsighted debate rules were bleaching the primary before voters got to pick their candidate.

“People in Iowa, people in New Hampshire, people in Nevada, people in South Carolina should determine this race. Not how much [money] is being poured in,” Booker said. “This isn't about an individual candidate, as much as I am hurt, my family members hurt, as much as people are frustrated about Kamala’s story. Kamala was never in it for herself. She knew this was a bigger story. This is not about one candidate. It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.”

Booker returned again and again to Harris, whose campaign had collapsed in Iowa, but who had been drawing bigger crowds, more endorsements, and more volunteers than the wealthy candidates who'd plunged into the race.

“She had this campaign that spoke to the aspirations of our country,” Booker said. “Here is a black woman, an Asian woman who broke barriers at every point of her campaign, and won in our largest state: 40-plus million people. She's lived her whole life dedicated to public service. I get to sit with her in the Judiciary Committee, I see who she is and I just want to say from my heart, it is a problem when an immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters, didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa.”

It was a dramatic moment for Booker, who had been making this case again and again in the hours since Harris's campaign ended. Harris had qualified for the December debate, making her an inconvenient martyr for this cause. But her exit gave new urgency to an argument former HUD secretary Julián Castro had been making when he missed the November debate: The party was silencing several credible nonwhite candidates.

That argument has helped Castro, who has no path back to the stage under current rules, raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, keeping his low-overhead campaign afloat. It has found a guilty conscience in Tom Steyer, the billionaire whose omnipresent TV ads have helped him qualify for the debates.

“I’m calling on the DNC to open up the debate requirements for January so that more candidates can participate,” Steyer said in a statement. “In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats need to engage voters from every part of the country, and that means making sure voters hear from a diverse group of candidates before they select our nominee.”

Steyer was pushing on an open door; DNC Chairman Tom Perez told The Post last month that the DNC would revisit its debate rules in January. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said that the party had created “the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires,” and that Democrats were “proud of this historic and diverse field,” as showcased in most of the debates so far.

“While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process,” Hinojosa said. “Nobody who has failed to reach 4 percent at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.”

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Joe Biden, “Laughed At.” A pool camera covering a Buckingham Palace reception for NATO members captured Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau making fun of President Trump. Within 24 hours, Biden's campaign put it into an ad that focuses on the theme of his recent campaign spots: that Trump is embarrassing the country and the former vice president could restore its image. Three of Biden's last four commercials hit the same notes (and even the same imagery, of Biden walking alongside Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel), but this one went viral quickly, helped by audio clips of TV hosts discussing how little respect Trump commanded.

Elizabeth Warren, “Wealth Tax.” The senator from Massachusetts has spent less on TV than anyone else polling in double digits, and her campaign plunked down less than $1,000 to run this spot, in conjunction with her Bloomberg TV interview. It's her second time with this gimmick; previously, she bought time on CNBC to highlight criticism of the wealth tax from some of the network's wealthy guests.

Tom Steyer, “Save the World, Do It Together.” The billionaire candidate's march through early-state TV screens continues with a first: a subtle argument with another candidate. In the spot, Steyer asks a rhetorical question: “How are we going to pull this country together?” He answers it by talking about climate change. “We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world and do it together. You think that’d pull America together? I do.” It's a response to the message that has done well for Buttigieg recently, that the post-Trump president's first job will be reuniting Americans, something he doesn't tie to a particular issue.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (UC Berkeley, 1,694 California voters)

Bernie Sanders: 24% ( 5)

Elizabeth Warren: 22% (-7)

Joe Biden: 14% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg: 12% ( 6)

Kamala Harris: 7% (-1)

Andrew Yang: 3% ( 1)

Amy Klobuchar: 3% ( 1)

Mike Bloomberg: 2% ( 2)

This may be the final poll to offer Kamala Harris's name for voters, and a sub-question found that 61 percent of California Democrats thought she should leave the race. It's also Sanders's first good poll in the state for some time, though Harris's departure ameliorates the bad news for Warren: She was the most popular second choice for voters who had been sticking with the race's second-highest-profile female candidate. And she's in a better position than Biden, who trails Sanders with Latino voters and gets pummeled with young voters: By a landslide, voters under 30 stick with Sanders. Biden's strength with nonwhite Democrats, the basis of his lead in Southern primaries, is harder to find in delegate-rich California.

IN THE STATES

Florida. Andrew Gillum, last year's unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor, will become the chairman of iVote's board, following a year of voting rights advocacy and voter registration campaigns in his home state.

Georgia. Five-term Rep. Tom Graves will retire next year, a surprise for Republicans who saw a long future for their 49-year-old colleague. Graves's 14th District, which covered northwest Georgia, is safely Republican and backed the president by 53 points in 2016.

Washington. Four-term Rep. Denny Heck is leaving his relatively safe Democratic seat around Tacoma, explaining in a letter that the Republican response to the Trump presidency had wearied him: “Will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.” Trump lost Heck's 10th Congressional District by 13 points, making it a reach for Republicans in a state Democrats expect to easily win.

2020

Joe Biden. He got one of the biggest endorsements in the Democratic Party on Thursday, with former secretary of state and 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry getting behind his campaign. Kerry, who's three years younger than Biden, had been fitfully discussed as a 2020 candidate but made no moves toward a run. He'll campaign with the former vice president this weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Pete Buttigieg. He won endorsements from three lower-profile members of the Obama team: the president's personal aide Reggie Love, former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Austan Goolsbee, and former White House Office of Health Reform communications director Linda Douglass.

Bernie Sanders. He picked up the support of the Iowa CCI Action Fund, a liberal group in the state that had supported him in 2016 and worked with him in his campaigns.

Mike Bloomberg. In Aurora, Colo., the site of a 2013 mass shooting, he proposed a new gun control system that would include not just background checks but federal licensing, a bugaboo of gun rights activists.

Cory Booker. United We Win, the new super PAC that had bought an ad contrasting Booker with Buttigieg, announced $500,000 in new spending designed to help him enter the December debate. One example: a bus ad showing Booker next to Bloomberg and Steyer, with the legend, “We need diversity, not more billionaires.”

MEET A PAC

THE PAC: 1820 PAC

PARTY: Republican

FOCUS: Providing air cover for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, running ads that pitch her as a moderate who the Senate could not afford to lose.

BUDGET: It has paid for $400,000 of ads so far, and as of summer, it had raised $776,000 from wealthy donors, most of it from Blackstone Group chief executive Stephen Schwartzman.

PLAN: The group's first ad emphasizes ways in which Collins has broke with Republicans and the Trump administration. “When the big drug companies were gouging patients, Susan took them on and wrote a law to lower drug prices,” a narrator says. “When extremists in both parties shut down the government, Susan Collins led the bipartisan effort to end the stalemate.”

EFFECTIVENESS: It's on brand for Collins, whose campaign, like others that have expected super PACs to help them, had already uploaded b-roll footage for curious ad-makers. (Campaigns cannot coordinate with super PACs, but nothing prevents them releasing a few soundless clips of candidates meeting voters in factories.)

WHAT I'M WATCHING

NARAL's big 2020 bet. The abortion rights group is planning its biggest-ever political investment next year, spending $34.7 million to turn out 3.6 million voters in eight states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina.

“We think abortion is central to the election, and it should be central,” said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. “It’s an issue Democrats can and do win on. The energy of the base on this is off the charts, because of the abortion bans we’ve seen in the states.”

NARAL's target states include a few of the Democrats' must-wins in the electoral college and a few the group sees as crucial for Senate math: Georgia and Iowa. (There are Senate races in all eight states, and Michigan and Minnesota have Democratic incumbents.)

The focus of the campaign, a combination of ads and organizing, will be “reminding people of what their senator has done and what Trump has led,” said Hogue. That included the “extraordinary overreach of judges,” the appointment of antiabortion judges who most of the targeted senators voted for (Collins was an occasional exception), and the passage or introduction of “dangerous medically inaccurate legislation” in the states.

That messaging, Hogue said, would activate three kinds of voters: the Democrats' base, lower-propensity voters who lean toward Democrats (and sat out some recent elections), and “soft partisan” women who've voted Republican before but bolted the party over abortion rights. Virginia, where Republicans tried and failed to turn legislation to loosen abortion restrictions into an election issue this year, was the proof of concept.

Hogue, who helped amend the Democrats' 2016 platform to make it more supportive of abortion rights, said that NARAL had advantages that didn't exist then.

“We were warning people that Trump said women should be punished for abortion, and that he’d appoint only pro-life judges,” Hogue said. “But there was a combination of people saying, 'Oh, he only says that to be elected,' and 'Oh, and that could never happen here.' That’s what’s been so shocking with these state laws, and that's why they're central to the campaign.”

He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump,” the report continued. “His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors, but they present a chance, according to Biden’s team, to truly connect with voters in an intimate way that has long been his strong suit.”

Biden has survived and is now more critical of his rivals, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) who he claims never got the scrutiny she deserved for her Medicare-for-all plan. (He might have added that she has not gotten many queries about her subsequent retreat from Medicare-for-all, either.) He has a few things going for him now that the candidates have dwindled.

AD

AD

First, no one in Iowa can honestly doubt who he is and what he stands for. He was never for Medicare-for-all; he wants to build on the Affordable Care Act. He is not an America First or an America Retreat proponent. Reporters talk a lot about authenticity but do not seem to grasp that, for many voters, all those gaffes and strange verbal journeys show how different he is from his opponents. He does not need to introduce himself to the African American community. He is comfortable in his own skin (maybe too comfortable?), which voters can sense. Even if they don’t love him, they trust him.

Second, Biden sure has lowered expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire. That is the flip side of losing one’s lead. He does not have to win or even come in second to keep going. Staying ahead of one or more of his rivals in these first two races likely will be good enough to keep him in the race through Super Tuesday when his national name recognition and support among nonwhite voters will pay off.

Finally, as Trump destroys one government institution after another, sending career civil servants into retirement and deforming the mission of Cabinet departments (Does anyone think the Environmental Protection Agency is looking out for your health and well-being?), it might dawn on voters that the next president will find the federal government in utter disarray. It surely is the case that the next president will have to rebuild our reputation internationally.

His recent ad makes the persuasive argument that it would be nice if foreign leaders didn’t laugh at the U.S. president:

Under such circumstances, perhaps someone who knows everyone and every nook and cranny of government and every world leader would be useful.

This is not to say that Biden is the “front-runner,” but he has as good a chance as anyone to win the nomination. He and his team have figured out that Twitter and the rest of social media, not to mention national media outlets’ snarky 30-something reporters, don’t represent America. You would be foolish to count him out.

(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)

With James Hohmann

THE BIG IDEA: Joe Biden won’t apologize for the deportations.

Barack Obama’s administration deported more than 3 million undocumented immigrants during his two terms, including 1.18 million in his first three years. In that equivalent amount of time, President Trump has deported fewer than 800,000.

In an interview that aired Thursday night on Telemundo, the Spanish-language station owned by NBC, anchor José Díaz-Balart tried repeatedly to get the former vice president to say he was sorry – to no avail.

Sitting on his “No Malarkey” bus, which he’s been using to barnstorm Iowa this week, Biden said he has “nothing” to apologize for. “Nothing,” he said with emphasis, adding that he and Obama did the best they could to help “the undocumenteds,” as the 77-year-old referred to them at one point during the back-and-forth.

“No, I think what we should be doing is acknowledging that comparing what President Obama did and what Trump did is night and day,” Biden said.

“No, but the numbers are there,” said Díaz-Balart.

“No, no, no, no,” said Biden.

“More than 3 million people were deported,” said the anchor.

“I understand that,” Biden said, blaming Republicans. “That was what the law was at the time.”

Biden said Obama deserves credit for minimizing deportations in the second term once it became clear Congress wouldn’t act. The Supreme Court is now considering the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. “If the Supreme Court rules against it, we're going to get it passed,” Biden said, referring to the fate of the “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children.

-- Unlike most of his opponents in the Democratic field, Biden still hasn’t released a comprehensive immigration plan. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker have unveiled proposals. So did Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and California Sen. Kamala Harris before they dropped out. Among the other contenders in the top tier, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also hasn’t released a detailed plan on immigration.

-- The Biden campaign is working to finalize a plan. In an interview with the Daily 202, Cristóbal Alex, former president of the Latino Victory Fund and the Biden campaign’s most senior adviser for issues involving Hispanic voters, previewed the plan he said will be “forthcoming.” It will outline an end to Trump’s family separation policy, protections for “dreamers” and address the root causes of the immigration crisis. This will include a proposal for foreign aid to stabilize the Northern Triangle countries in Central America, similar to what Sanders and Warren had in their plans.

Alex said Biden has repeatedly emphasized to him personally that he’s committed to spending considerable political capital to achieve a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration laws if he’s elected president. Alex said that will include legislation to provide citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country.

In the Telemundo interview last night, Biden said he supports allowing undocumented immigrants to benefit from his proposed expansion of the Affordable Care Act, specifically the public option. He quipped that as he builds out Obamacare, it will eventually become “Bidencare.”

“And they'd be able to buy in just like anyone else could,” Biden said of undocumented immigrants.

-- Biden’s plan will be more moderate than his rivals. So far, the biggest flashpoint in the Democratic immigration debate this year has been over whether to repeal a portion of the law that makes it a criminal offense to illegally enter the United States. The proposal was first made by former housing secretary Julián Castro, the first candidate to publish a detailed immigration plan, and it targets Section 1325 of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, which the Trump administration used to defend its family separation policies. Sanders and Warren endorsed Castro’s idea.

Biden still opposes repealing Section 1325, and that won’t change. He said during one of the debates that changing the law could incentivize more illegal immigration. “Repealing that section could undermine our immigration system. It could undermine efforts to combat human smuggling,"" Alex said in an interview. “It would shift an additional burden into the immigration court system. Additionally, if the logic behind ending 1325 is to end family separation, there are likely at least eight other laws on the books that someone nefarious and anti-immigrant like Trump could use to separate families. So the problem isn't 1325. The problem is Donald Trump.”

-- Biden’s lack of contrition for the Obama administration’s deportation record threatens to become a bigger hurdle as the field winnows and the contrasts sharpen. Overshadowed by the impeachment inquiry, plus the ideological clashes over Medicare-for-all, the immigration issue has drifted to the backburner of the Democratic conversation since the spring and summer.But Latinos are poised to play a potentially pivotal role in the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, the third early state, and then when Super Tuesday arrives on March 3, when California, Texas and Colorado go to the polls.

“I think the big question for Biden is whether he will learn from what the Obama administration failed at when it came to immigration,” said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, in an interview. “He must recognize that we are in a different place and what the Trump administration has exposed is what happens when immigration agencies, whether it be Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Border Patrol, are allowed to continue to grow and to do so without any accountability or liability. What we’re experiencing right now is part of the mechanism and machinery that the Obama administration put into place.”

Biden disputes this criticism. “They would have been able to do that before that structure,” he said on Telemundo. “They could have done that if we didn't do anything.”

-- The sit-down with Telemundo is part of a strategy to convey to Latinos that he’s not taking them for granted after his national coalitions director Vanessa Cárdenas, his most senior Latina staffer, quit last month. She told at least two allies that she was frustrated her advice on immigration wasn’t being heeded, according to Politico. “The campaign is just hyper-focused on whites in Iowa and African-Americans and it placed less value on Latino outreach,” an unnamed immigration activist and friend who spoke with her told Marc Caputo. “Vanessa kept banging her head against the wall trying to get them to take the community more seriously. And Biden just really won’t change when it comes to the way he talks about immigration. It became too much.”

-- Biden acknowledged Cárdenas’s frustrations during a conference call with reporters last week when he was asked about her departure. The candidate complimented the “very, very good” work she did for him and insisted that Latino outreach is one of his priorities. He said he has no choice but to spend as much time as possible in Iowa and New Hampshire because he didn’t join the race until April. “I can understand her frustration, in terms of the number of days” spent in certain states, Biden said, according to the Associated Press. “I understand her frustration. I’m getting the same thing, and I’m sure every candidate is, no matter what state you’re in, why you’re not spending more time in other states. I wish her well. I’m sorry she was frustrated.”

Cárdenas did not respond to a request for comment.

-- Just days after she stepped down, on Nov. 22, Biden clashed with immigration activist Carlos Rojas when he asked the former vice president if he would pledge to halt deportations. Biden said no, explaining that he will prioritize deportations only for “people who have committed a felony of serious crime.” When Rojas, who noted that he was a volunteer for the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign, countered by saying that he became disenchanted with the Obama administration after it deported so many people, Biden suggested that maybe Rojas “should vote for Trump.”

-- There have been other, smaller missteps. In October, the Biden campaign unveiled “a national network of Latino supporters” called “Todos Con Biden.” But they didn’t reserve the URL for the web site or the Twitter handle. The Trump campaign snapped up both and used them to troll Biden with unflattering content. “Oops, Joe forgot about Latinos,” the landing page on todosconbiden.com says in English and Spanish, with a link to Trump’s Latino outreach page.

-- Notably, none of the Democratic presidential candidates are calling to abolish ICE. For a while last year, that looked like it might become a new litmus test from the left. Warren said she believes the agency needs to be “reorganized significantly.” Sanders spokeswoman Belén Sisa said the Vermont senator believes in breaking up ICE to curtail an agency that he believes has been “completely unaccountable to some of the monstrosities” that have occurred in the last three years.

Castro supports maintaining some of the ICE and DHS operations he considers critical to U.S. safety. His spokesman Sawyer Hackett pointed out that there are investigators within these agencies that conduct a lot of work around sex and drug trafficking. “We can maintain those components while also moving the [Enforcement and Removal] section of ICE to the Department of Justice where we have more oversight and more accountability of those agencies,” Hackett explained.

-- For now, Biden is polling well among Latinos, something he touted during last night’s interview. A Telemundo poll published last month showed Biden holding on to the support of 26 percent of Latino voters who identify as Democrats, with Sanders in second place at 18 percent. Warren trailed with 10 percent and Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, polled at 2 percent.But even his boosters acknowledge that the race remains as fluid among this constituency as the electorate at large.Just like with African Americans, there is something of a generational divide between older Latinos and younger members of the community who tend to be more liberal and want bolder proposals.

MORE ON BIDEN:

-- The former vice president got into a testy back-and-forth yesterday afternoon with an Iowa farmer who called him too old to be president and challenged him on his son’s activities in Ukraine, prompting the former vice president to call the man “a damn liar” and challenge him to take an IQ test. “You’re damn near as old as I am,” the farmer said at a town hall meeting in New Hampton, Iowa. “You’re too old for the job. I’m 83, and I know damn well I don’t have the mental faculties I did 30 years ago. … We all know Trump has been messing around in the Ukraine over there, holding their foreign aid … saying they’re going to investigate you. But you, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing, to get access to the president. You’re selling access to the president just like he was.”

“You’re a damn liar, man,” Biden replied. “That’s not true. And no one has ever said that.”

“The hell it ain’t,” the man replied. “I see it on the TV.”

Biden said he played no role in getting his son the job on the board of Burisma. Although Hunter Biden got that job when his father was vice president, with little to no relevant experience, there is no evidence that Joe Biden was “selling access to the president.”

“And by the way, I’m not sedentary,” Biden continued. “Look, the reason I’m running is I’ve been around a long time, and I know more than most people know. And I can get things done, that’s why I’m running. And you want to check my shape, man, let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test, okay?”

(Trump has also challenged people to take an IQ test, including former secretary of state Rex Tillerson in 2017.)

-- Rudy Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with one of the key figures working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden, the Ukraine lawmaker said, after posting Facebook photographs of himself with Trump’s personal lawyer. “Andriy Derkach said he pressed Giuliani on the need to set up a joint U.S.-Ukraine investigation into corruption in Ukraine at the meeting in Kyiv,” David Stern and Robyn Dixon report. “Giuliani alleged ‘compelling’ evidence of criminal misdeeds by Biden [in a tweet after the meeting], but gave no specifics. … Derkach, an independent lawmaker who was formerly a member of a pro-Russian party in parliament, went to the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow. He is the son of a KGB officer who later served as head of Ukrainian intelligence.”

-- Former secretary of state John Kerry endorsed Biden and plans to campaign with him in Iowa on Friday and New Hampshire on Sunday. “I’m not endorsing Joe because I’ve known him a long time. I’m endorsing him because I know him so well,” Kerry told Dan Balz, who broke the story. “The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.”

Kerry, who served alongside Biden for decades in the Senate and won the Democratic nomination in 2004, said he feels strongly that his friend can beat Trump next November. “The president knows it,” he told Balz. “And that’s why he was so busy dispatching Rudy Giuliani and engaging in unconstitutional behavior.”

MORE ON THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- Video obtained by ProPublica shows how the Border Patrol held a sick teen in a concrete cell without proper medical attention and did not discover his body until his cellmate alerted guards about his death: “Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant, was seriously ill when immigration agents put him in a small South Texas holding cell with another sick boy on the afternoon of May 19. A few hours earlier, a nurse practitioner at the Border Patrol’s dangerously overcrowded processing center in McAllen had diagnosed him with the flu and measured his fever at 103 degrees. She said that he should be checked again in two hours and taken to the emergency room if his condition worsened. None of that happened. Worried that Carlos might infect other migrants in the teeming McAllen facility, officials moved him to a cell for quarantine at a Border Patrol station in nearby Weslaco. By the next morning, he was dead. … The agency said that an agent had found Carlos ‘unresponsive’ after checking in on him. Sanders said the Border Patrol was ‘committed to the health, safety and humane treatment of those in our custody.’ But the record shows that the Border Patrol fell far short of that standard with Carlos. ProPublica has obtained video that documents the 16-year-old’s last hours, and it shows that Border Patrol agents and health care workers at the Weslaco holding facility missed increasingly obvious signs that his condition was perilous.”

-- The number of pregnant immigration detainees has spiked 52 percent during the Trump administration. Maria Sacchetti reports: “The spike in pregnant detainees came after federal officials terminated an Obama administration order to release most expectant mothers because of health concerns. Advocates for immigrants had pushed the Obama administration to sharply curtail the practice of detaining pregnant women ahead of the 2016 elections, citing insufficient health care and nutrition in federal detention centers and contract jails and the increased risk of miscarriage. But shortly after the policy went into effect, Trump declared that nobody in the United States illegally is immune to detention and deportation.”

-- Under pressure, Trump's Department of Homeland Security backed away from its proposal to require mandatory facial scans for all U.S. citizens crossing the border. Lori Aratani reports: “Reports this week that Customs and Border Protection wanted to expand airport facial screening to U.S. citizens drew an immediate outcry from privacy advocates and lawmakers, who accused administration officials of reneging on promises that the scans would remain optional for citizens. … On Thursday, however, CBP said it was withdrawing the proposal. ‘There are no current plans to require U.S. citizens to provide photographs upon entry and exit from the United States,’ the agency said in a statement. ‘CBP intends to have the planned regulatory action regarding U.S. citizens removed from the unified agenda next time it is published.’”

-- The Trump administration’s plan to charge huge fees to obtain immigration records may have the unintended consequence of undermining the booming genealogy testing market. Sydney Trent reports: “The fees would nearly triple, and in many cases, they would rise nearly 500 percent, from $130 to $625 to obtain a single paper file. The little-known Genealogy Program administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allows genealogists, family historians and other researchers to obtain citizenship and alien registration files, visa applications and other records documenting the lives of deceased immigrants who arrived in the United States between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. … The increases come at a time when millions of Americans are discovering a passion for family genealogy, spurring the growth of websites and services that cater to them. Ancestry.com, one of the most popular, now has more than 3 million paying subscribers perusing its databases of documents and DNA connections.”

-- A new lawsuit challenges the Trump administration’s policy of requiring foreigners to list all of their social media accounts on visa applications. Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report: “The requirement — implemented as part of the president’s controversial crackdown on immigration — amounts to an illegal surveillance dragnet that threatens to chill political expression online, according to a group of documentary filmmakers, who filed their case with the backing of two advocacy groups, the Brennan Center for Justice and the Knight First Amendment Institute.”

-- A House committee chair called for an independent investigation into the $400 million border wall contract awarded this week to a North Dakota company owned by a frequent Fox News guest and major GOP donor. Trump personally pushed military officials to hire the firm. Nick Miroff reports: “In a letter to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said there are reasons to be suspicious of the decision to bestow such a large contract on the company. Thompson cited Trump’s repeated promotion of [Tommy] Fisher to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and a recent visit by the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to a span of privately financed barrier the firm built outside El Paso.”

Emergency responders head to the scene of a shooting on Friday morning near the Naval Air Base Station in Pensacola, Fla. (WEAR-TV via AP)

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- A shooter who opened fire Friday morning at Naval Air Station Pensacola, killing at least two people and injuring multiple people, has died, authorities said. Brittany Shammas and Alex Horton report: “It was unclear if the two victims killed were service members or civilians, said Lt. Cmdr. Megan Isaac, a Navy spokeswoman. … An active shooting at the Naval station was reported at about 6:45 a.m., and the base was placed on lockdown, the Navy said.”

-- The United States added 266,000 jobs in November as the jobless rate decreased to 3.5 percent, reflecting a surge of strength in the labor market that has muscled through recession fears that flared over the summer. Rachel Siegel reports: “The data, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, beat expectations. Analysts had forecast roughly 180,000 new jobs for the month. The 3.5 percent unemployment rate is back at a 50-year low. The jobs data offer the latest snapshot into an economy that appears to have lost some steam from 2018 but continues to grow.”

-- Elizabeth Warren released a letter from her physician this morning that describes her as “very healthy” and issued five pages of supporting medical records, making her the first of the four septuagenarians in the Democratic contest to provide details about their health. Annie Linskey reports: “Warren takes medication for hypothyroidism, a common condition in which the thyroid gland is underactive, according to the letter. Her blood pressure is 115/57, and she has had a flu shot this year. Warren is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 129 pounds. … Warren also provided a hematology report including information on everything from her platelet count to the size of her red blood cells. …

“Sanders, at 78, is the oldest candidate in the race. He suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, which sidelined him until a Democratic debate two weeks later. Sanders had two stents inserted, but his campaign has declined to specify how much damage his heart sustained and declined interview requests with his physician. The Vermont senator’s campaign has said it would provide his health records by the end of the year. … After a debate in September in which his answers sometimes meandered and one challenger appeared to allude to his age, Biden committed to releasing his health records ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Democrats are considering articles of impeachment against Trump that include obstruction and bribery, but they are unlikely to pursue a charge of treason. Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis report: “Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee, which this week released a report of their findings from a two-month-long impeachment investigation, have said that they believe Trump’s actions vis-a-vis Ukraine meet the definition of bribery, one of the crimes the Constitution identifies specifically as an impeachable offense. … Democratic leaders say they have overwhelming support in their ranks for articles dealing with the core of Trump’s conduct regarding Ukraine … Aides cautioned that the situation remains fluid and that discussions about the articles are ongoing. Several members of the Judiciary panel are also eager to make reference in the articles to the president’s alleged efforts to obstruct justice in former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia probe, arguing that Trump has repeatedly solicited or welcomed foreign interference in his election bids. …

""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) insisted that Russia was an integral factor in the president’s alleged misconduct regarding Ukraine, because when Trump decided to withhold military aid to Kyiv, it was the Kremlin that benefited. ‘Russia. It’s about Russia,’ Pelosi said. ‘All roads lead to Putin. Understand that.’ But Democrats have yet to commit to including articles of impeachment that directly address Trump’s alleged ties to Russia that were detailed in the Mueller report, or settle on how they will organize and draft their various grievances against the president.”

-- Pelosi shut down a reporter who asked her whether she ""hates"" Trump. Felicia Sonmez reports: “Pelosi … was about to exit the room when a reporter shouted out a question. ‘Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?’ James Rosen, a reporter for Sinclair Broadcast Group, called out from a seat in the front row. Most times, Pelosi ignores questions shouted at her in the hallways and briefing rooms of the Capitol. But Rosen’s query appeared to strike a nerve with Pelosi, who stopped in her tracks, turned to face the reporter and delivered an extraordinary rebuttal. ‘I don’t hate anybody,’ Pelosi said sternly, pointing her finger at Rosen, a reporter she has dismissed as ‘Mr. Republican Talking Points.’ Pelosi then referenced her Catholic upbringing and told Rosen, ‘Don’t accuse me.’ … ‘As a Catholic, I resent your using the word ‘hate’ in a sentence that addresses me,’ she said. ‘I don’t hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love, and [I] always pray for the president, and I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So, don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.’” Trump responded on Twitter that he does not believe Pelosi prays for him.

-- “These days Pelosi, a history major in college, spends much of her time quoting the founders of the nation in her bid to justify her move to embrace impeachment. Occasionally she favors the Bible,” Rachael Bade and DeBonis report in a ticktock on how the speaker transformed from a skeptic to the face of impeachment. “On Thursday morning, before lashing out at the news conference, she read verses from the Old Testament book of Jeremiah to her whip team in the Capitol basement — a warning about corrupt kings. ‘Attend to matters of justice. Set things right between people. Rescue victims from their exploiters. Don’t take advantage of the homeless, the orphans, the widows,’ she read. ‘Doom to the leader who builds palaces but bullies people, who makes a fine house but destroys lives.’”

-- The phone logs disclosed in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report have raised fresh concerns about Trump’s use of unsecured communications, against the advice of aides and breaking with longstanding practice. Paul Sonne, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller report: “Trump has routinely communicated with [Giuliani] and other individuals speaking on cellphones vulnerable to monitoring by Russian and other foreign intelligence services, current and former U.S. officials said. Phone records released this week by the House Intelligence Committee revealed extensive communications between Giuliani, unidentified people at the White House and others involved in the campaign to pressure Ukraine, with no indication that those calls were encrypted or otherwise shielded from foreign surveillance. The revelations raise the possibility that Moscow was able to learn about aspects of Trump’s attempt to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival months before that effort was exposed by a whistleblower report and the impeachment inquiry, officials said. ... The disclosures provide fresh evidence suggesting that the president continues to defy the security guidance urged by his aides and followed by previous incumbents. ...

""Trump and Giuliani have effectively 'given the Russians ammunition they can use in an overt fashion, a covert fashion or in the twisting of information,' said John Sipher, former deputy chief of Russia operations at the CIA. Sipher and others said that it is so likely that Russia tracked the calls of Giuliani and others that the Kremlin probably knows more now about those conversations than impeachment investigators. 'Congress and investigators have call records that suggest certain things but have no means whatsoever of getting the actual text' of what was said, Sipher said. 'I guarantee the Russians have the actual information.'

""U.S. officials said that Giuliani would have been considered a target of Russian intelligence efforts from early in Trump’s presidency and that it is assumed that the Kremlin intensified its surveillance of the president’s lawyer when he turned his focus to Ukraine — a former Soviet republic and target of Kremlin aggression where Russian intelligence has made deep inroads — late last year. 'That would definitely put him on the radar,' said a U.S. official ... U.S. officials said that Russia would likely have him under physical surveillance when he is in Ukraine.""

-- The White House claims that no one from the Office of Management and Budget spoke with Giuliani. From the Journal: “The previously undisclosed phone number cited by the House Intelligence Committee in its impeachment inquiry report, which The Wall Street Journal has identified, isn’t directly linked to the Office of Management and Budget. It could instead reflect phone calls from other parts of the White House, according to people familiar with the matter … It isn’t known whom Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, spoke with in the administration in the calls reflected in the logs, but OMB officials say it wasn’t anyone on their staff. A White House official had previously said the call logs don’t align with the cellphone records of acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is also the budget office director. A senior House Intelligence Committee official said the panels overseeing the impeachment probe are continuing to investigate the call records, including whether the number described as linked to OMB could also reference calls from elsewhere in the White House.”

-- Trump asked the Supreme Court to review court decisions granting Congress access to his financial records. Robert Barnes reports: “Warning of ‘uncharted territory,’ Trump asked the court for the second time to review rulings from lower courts that have said Congress and state prosecutors have a right to review his personal and business records. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision in favor of the House Oversight and Reform Committee presents the Supreme Court with a ‘case of firsts,’ wrote Trump’s personal lawyer William S. Consovoy. … The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider a related case at its private conference Dec. 13. It involves a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that granted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. similar access to Trump’s financial records, which are held by his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA. The company has said it will comply with final court orders. If the court decides to order full briefing and argument in both cases, it could lead to landmark decisions this term on the ability of prosecutors and Congress to investigate the president. Both subpoenas are independent of the House’s impeachment inquiry.”

-- A federal judge appointed by Trump rejected the Trump administration's efforts to conceal several financial disclosure forms submitted by former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, a cable talking head whom the president tapped to serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer after firing Jeff Sessions. From Politico: “Acting on a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by BuzzFeed, District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled Wednesday that the draft financial disclosures are ineligible for protection under an exemption protecting the confidentiality of policy-making debates. ‘The Court is unpersuaded by DOJ’s 'deliberative process' arguments,’ wrote McFadden ... ‘Whitaker’s draft forms do not bear the mark of the deliberative process.’”

-- Karen McDougal, the former Playboy bunny who says Trump carried on an affair with her while he's been married to Melania Trump, filed a lawsuit against Fox News for alleged defamation. From CNN: “In the lawsuit, which was filed in a New York state court, McDougal accused host Tucker Carlson of acting with a ‘reckless disregard for the truth’ when he suggested on a December 2018 episode of his show that she extorted Trump. In a statement provided by a Fox News spokesperson, the network said it would ‘vigorously defend Tucker Carlson against these meritless claims.’”

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador meets with Attorney General Bill Barr on Thursday at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City. (Mexican Presidency/AFP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Attorney General Bill Barr’s meeting in Mexico could be a prelude to greater U.S. involvement in the fight against drug cartels. Kevin Sieff reports: When Barr “met with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Thursday, it marked the highest-level discussion of a matter of bitter disagreement between the two countries: Should drug cartels be designated as terrorist organizations? … For decades, the United States has worked with Mexico to combat drug cartels, helping to develop the very architecture of Mexico’s security apparatus. But with Trump and López Obrador, the dynamic is more complicated than ever before. López Obrador, known by his initials as AMLO, has long rejected a security strategy involving increased militarization, instead endorsing an array of social programs aimed at dissuading would-be cartel members from joining organized crime. Trump, on the other hand, has been talking about a U.S. role in fighting cartels since taking office. …

“After Thursday’s meeting, both sides played down the dispute over the terrorist designation, which could potentially have implications for both U.S. security involvement in Mexico and Mexico’s financial sector, if more comprehensive anti-money laundering policies are applied. … In a news release about the meeting, the Justice Department did not mention the terrorism designation. ... Still, many in Mexico worry about a further emboldening of security forces in the fight against drug traffickers. Over the past decade, that approach has frequently led to the splintering of armed groups and an uptick in violence.”

-- “Pelosi is pushing to strip out sweeping legal protections for online content in the new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, in what would be a blow for big technology companies,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “Internet firms lobbied hard to include the immunity language in the trade agreement, seeing it as a way to extend to Mexico and Canada the broad umbrella of legal protection they enjoy in the U.S.”

-- China will waive tariffs on some U.S. soybeans and pork in a goodwill gesture as the two sides try to reach a broader agreement to defuse their trade war. From Reuters: “The tariff waivers were based on applications by individual firms for U.S. soybeans and pork imports, the finance ministry said in a statement, citing a decision by the country’s cabinet. It did not specify the quantities involved. China had imposed the levies in response to tariffs launched by Washington over allegations that China steals and forces the transfer of American intellectual property to Chinese firms, known as Section 301. That includes tariffs of 25% on both U.S. soybeans and pork in July 2018 and a further 10% on pork and 5% on soybeans in September this year. The waiver comes amid negotiations between the United States and China to conclude a ‘phase one’ or interim deal to de-escalate a 17-month trade war that has roiled financial markets, disrupted supply chains and weighed on global economic growth.”

-- The U.S. said Iranian forces may have killed more than 1,000 protesters during weeks of unrest. Carol Morello and Missy Ryan report: “Brian Hook, the special representative for Iran, said the Trump administration will ask Congress to impose harsh sanctions on officials responsible for the alleged atrocities and mistreatment of thousands of protesters who have been imprisoned since anti-government demonstrations have convulsed Iran.”

-- Trump’s bromance with Kim Jong Un appears to be turning sour after the North Korean leader responded to Trump’s “rocket man” diss by invoking the “senile dotard” taunt. Simon Denyer reports: “On Tuesday, Trump jokingly dusted off an old nickname for Kim, calling him ‘Rocket Man’ for his keenness to test his weapons systems. If it was a joke, Pyongyang didn’t get it. North Korea responded angrily on Thursday by threatening to call Trump a senile dotard. The U.S. president ‘has lost politeness to the highest dignity of our republic and dared to use metaphors,’ said Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s vice foreign minister, according to the Korean Central News Agency. … ‘If he uses statements and expressions that intentionally amplify the atmosphere of confrontation at this time of crisis, we will have to diagnose that the dotard started to be senile again,’ she said.”

-- New satellite imagery shows activity at a previously dismantled North Korean test site. From CNN: “The commercial satellite imagery, which was captured on Thursday by Planet Labs, shows new activity at Sohae Satellite Launching Station and the presence of a large shipping container at the facility's engine test stand, according Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, which works in partnership with the imaging company. The shipping container was not seen at the site before Thursday and its presence suggests the North Koreans are moving to resume tests engine tests at Sohae...”

-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended an off-the-books sit-down meeting with a conservative group that included a number of wealthy Republican donors while he was in London for the NATO summit. From CNN: “The gathering, hosted by the Hamilton Society, conveniently took place in the hotel where Pompeo was staying, situated in a small events space on the second floor. Pompeo slipped into the meeting, without the State Department alerting the press traveling with him about where he was headed or who he was going to meet. … The Hamilton Society is a group of right-leaning American and British business professionals who often invite guest speakers to meet them. The news that he made time to meet with the donors after a busy day visiting with world leaders only serves to heighten speculation that Pompeo may be eyeing a run for the Senate in Kansas next year and as he has become further embroiled in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.”

-- Two Russian nationals were charged in global hacking schemes that deployed some of the largest pieces of malware ever seen to swipe tens of millions of dollars from unsuspecting victims’ bank accounts. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: “Officials identified those charged as Maksim Yakubets of Moscow and Igor Turashev of Yoshkar-Ola, Russia. They said that a $5 million reward is being offered for information that leads to Yakubets’s capture and that it’s the largest such money offering yet for a cyber criminal. Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department’s criminal division, said Yakubets was the ‘leader of a criminal cyber gang’ and had been involved in cyber crime for the past decade on an ‘unimaginable scale.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Uber has disclosed that 3,000 sexual assaults were reported on its U.S. rides last year, the first time it has revealed the scale of the safety problem that exists at ride-hailing companies. Faiz Siddiqui reports: “The reported assaults were part of Uber’s long-awaited safety study, published Thursday amid widespread and ongoing criticism of its safety practices and pressure to increase its transparency about the issue. In the lengthy report, which divides sexual misconduct into 21 categories but focuses on the five most serious, Uber said it recorded 235 rapes last year and thousands more reports of assault that could involve unwanted touching, kissing or attempted rape. The reports involved drivers and passengers. The company tallied roughly 6,000 reports of those types of assault in 2017 and 2018. … Uber said its data showed that drivers reported instances of sexual assault at the same rate as riders across the five most serious categories it recorded. …

“Uber said there were 107 motor-vehicle fatalities in 2017 and 2018, with a total of 97 fatal crashes involving users on the app. The company also said there were 19 fatal physical assaults over the same time period, during which it said an average of more than 3.1 million trips took place each day. … Lyft has pledged to release a transparency report of its own. … Lyft has faced lawsuits from at least 34 women in San Francisco who allege they were raped or sexually assaulted on rides booked through the app.”

-- In an amicus brief, hundreds of lawyers shared their own abortion stories as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a challenge to Louisiana's assault on reproductive rights. Deanna Paul reports: “Having exercised what they say is their right to a safe and legal abortion, for varied personal and medical reasons, the women said they were compelled to tell the nation’s highest court the role it played in their life trajectories. ‘Becoming a first-generation professional would have been impossible without access to safe and legal abortion services,’ one signer wrote. ‘The ability to make my own choice, to even have a choice, gave me control over my life when I felt like I was utterly powerless.’ … Another described her 31-year-old mother’s death in 1959, after she attempted to perform her own abortion. … Many of the brief’s signers are women with whom the Supreme Court justices went to law school, clerked alongside and employed as clerks. Some are the female attorneys who stand up and argue before them.”

-- A uranium-contaminated site collapsed into the Detroit River last month. From the Detroit Free Press: “Located next to Historic Fort Wayne and leased by Detroit Bulk Storage, the site known as the Detroit Dock allegedly collapsed under the weight of large aggregate piles that were stored at the site during Thanksgiving weekend. The property has been listed by the U.S. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency as a contaminated site due to its use of uranium and other dangerous chemicals during manufacturing dating to the 1940s...""

-- Armed robbers in Florida hijacked a UPS truck and led police on a chase that ended in a fatal shootout. Marisa Iati reports: “The two robbers, a UPS driver and a person in a nearby car were killed in the shooting in Miramar, George Piro, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, told reporters. Police said no officers were killed. A female employee of Regent Jewelers in nearby Coral Gables was injured, that city’s police force said. Her status was not immediately clear, Chief Ed Hudak told reporters. The incident began when Coral Gables police received a silent holdup alarm from the jewelry store in the city’s Miracle Mile section around 4:15 p.m., Hudak said. … The robbers fled north in a truck and, about 20 minutes later, abducted a UPS truck and its driver at gunpoint while the driver was making a delivery in Coral Gables, Hudak said.”

-- California regulators imposed a one-year moratorium banning insurers from dropping policies for homeowners in wildfire-ravaged areas of the state. From the Los Angeles Times: “The move comes amid an exodus of some insurers in communities hard hit by fires, forcing some homeowners to take plans that provide less coverage, sometimes at higher premiums. Some have had to go without insurance altogether. ‘I have heard the same story again and again. People getting dropped by their insurance after decades,’ California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said. ‘To add insult to injury, many struggle to find coverage.’ Though existing law prohibits insurers from dropping policies for homeowners who have suffered a total loss in a wildfire, the moratorium relies on a law that went into effect this year that extends that rule to homeowners who live adjacent to a declared wildfire emergency and did not lose their home.”

Members of St. David’s were deeply disturbed by the hateful graffiti scrawled on the church’s walls. (Suzannah Couch/Brown County Democrat)

-- An investigation into the defacing of a church in Indiana soon after Trump’s election led to an unlikely suspect – and the discovery of a hate crime hoax. Peter Jamison reports: “The knock on Nathan Stang’s door came just after 1 p.m. … ‘Hi, Nathan,’ said Brian Shrader, a deputy with the Brown County Sheriff’s Department. ‘Remember me?’ … It was Shrader who had interviewed him after an appalling act of vandalism at St. David’s Episcopal Church, where Stang played the organ and directed the choir. On the Sunday morning after the 2016 election, Stang had discovered the church’s walls defaced with black spray paint: a swastika, along with the words ‘Heil Trump’ and ‘Fag Church.’ … The graffiti in rural Indiana became a national sensation, part of a string of high-profile hate crime reports in the wake of Trump’s victory. … Stang played music as the spray paint was finally scrubbed off at a ceremony of healing attended by more than 200 people. … As a gay man, Stang had dreaded the unexpected triumph of Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights. …

“When Shrader appeared on his doorstep five months later, in April 2017, Stang was struggling with major depression. Over the winter, he had contemplated suicide. His face — fine-featured and quick to come alive when he sat at the keyboard or stood before a classroom of undergraduates — was covered in dark stubble. … Stang, expressionless, watched the 30-year-old detective’s face. There had been no arrests for the vandalism, and no outward signs that investigators were making progress. But the case had reached a critical juncture, and though Stang didn’t know it, Shrader was surreptitiously recording their conversation. A copy of the video was later provided to The Washington Post. ‘I’ve spent six months on this case, okay? A long time,’ Shrader said slowly. He took a breath and placed his right hand, palm down, on the armrest console that separated them. ‘Based on what I’ve found in this investigation,’ he told the organist, ‘you’re responsible for this.’”

-- West Virginia’s governor is calling for the firing of several corrections employees who are already suspended for performing a Nazi salute in a class photo. Kim Bellware reports: “Gov. Jim Justice (R) said such conduct would not be tolerated. … ‘I have directed Secretary Jeff Sandy of the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety to continue actively investigating this incident, and I have ordered the termination of all those that are found to be involved in this conduct,’ [he told The Post]. Justice was briefed on the matter by Sandy, who announced in a Wednesday letter to DCR employees that several employees had been suspended. … In his letter, Sandy did not discuss how or when the photo came to his attention. The photo, provided to The Post with faces of the participants already blurred out, is labeled as DCR ‘Basic Training Class #18’ that took place from Oct. 21 to Nov. 27.”

-- A former video editor for Infowars host Alex Jones describes in a New York Times essay the tense – and sometimes downright abusive – conditions the conspiracy theorist’s staff worked under as they produced stories based on misinformation and debunked myths. “Working for Jones was a balancing act. You had to determine where he was emotionally and match his tone quickly. If he was angry, then you had better get angry. If he was joking around, then you could relax, sort of, always looking out of the corner of your eye for his mood to turn at any moment. … Ideas for stories mostly came from what other news outlets reported. Jones wanted us to ‘hijack’ the mainstream media’s coverage and use it to our advantage. If it fit into the Infowars narrative, it played,” writes Josh Owens.

In the essay, Owens admits to making up stories about a Muslim community in New York. “We were sent to visit Muslim-majority communities throughout the United States to investigate what Jones instructed us to call ‘the American Caliphate.’ … We landed in Newark at 12:30 p.m. on Dec. 1, 2015. The first stop was Islamberg, a Muslim community three hours north of Manhattan. It was founded in the 1980s by mostly African-American followers of a Pakistani cleric named Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani … Gilani was suspected of association with the organization Jamaat ul-Fuqra, which was briefly designated as a terrorist group by the State Department in the 1990s; Gilani has denied any connection to the group. … But unfounded rumors circulated around far-right corners of the internet that this community was a potential terrorist-training center. Jones, who thought the media consistently ingratiated themselves with Islamic extremists, believed them. … We pulled in, unannounced … Because of the conspiracy theories about the place, Islamberg was a constant target of right-wing extremists … So the phone call we received later that night from a law-enforcement agent shouldn’t have come as a surprise. The officer who contacted us said he simply wanted to verify who we were after receiving a concerned call from someone in Islamberg. … Jones told us to file a story that accused the police of harassment, lending credence to the theory that this community contained dangerous, potential terrorists. I knew this wasn’t the case according to the information we had. We all did.”

As the effects from Harris’s departure Tuesday continued to ripple through the Democratic Party, two of the highest-profile candidates of color remaining in the field — Booker (D-N.J.) and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro — sought to seize the moment. They hope to tap into the concerns voiced by many in the party that a lack of diversity among the top candidates could undermine efforts to mobilize voters of color, who stayed home in record numbers in 2016.

AD

Booker, who is African American, and Castro, who is Latino, have both been outspoken in praising Harris (D-Calif.), their erstwhile rival, appealing to her former supporters who are now shopping around for a new candidate to represent their vision of an inclusive party, hoping the Democrats’ self-scrutiny would win their candidacies a second look.

Castro blamed journalists for focusing on which Democrat would be most “electable,” and suggesting a white man would have the best shot at defeating President Trump.

AD

“The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” Castro said on Twitter. “Our party’s diversity is our strength, and it’s a shame that we’re headed for a December debate without a single person of color.”

And on a campaign swing in California, Castro assailed the media for its coverage of Harris, telling CBS News the press had held her to a “a different standard, a double standard … that was grossly unfair” by focusing on turmoil within her campaign rather than her message.

AD

More broadly, Harris’s abrupt exit has spurred Democrats to grapple with the increasing whiteness of their 2020 field, including the possibility the Dec. 19 debate might feature only white candidates.

AD

With the qualification deadline a week away, the remaining minority candidates in the race — Booker, Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and businessman Andrew Yang — have yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling and donor thresholds.

While the Democrats began with a historically diverse field, the candidates who are near the top of most polls — former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — are white.

Booker said it was not rank-and-file Democrats who pushed Harris from the race, adding, “Voters did not determine her destiny.” Rather, he argued, it was a flawed process that favors wealthy candidates, who can use their money to goose their polling numbers and spur additional contributions.

“I’m just going to say it plain: It is a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency that has more billionaires in it than black people,” Booker said at his Des Moines event.

In the crowd, an older black woman nodded and lifted a hand to the air.

Booker has been especially aggressive on the subject in recent days, speaking about his “anger” over Harris’s exit with reporters and voicing concerns about the debate thresholds with new urgency.

On Tuesday, just hours after Harris’s announcement, Booker’s campaign added Thursday’s speech to a planned four-day, 12-stop swing though Iowa, a state that could determine the fortunes of his struggling presidential bid.

AD

Booker has invested heavily in the ground game in the state and is banking that a good showing here could propel him with new momentum into other early primary states, essentially the same strategy that worked for Barack Obama in 2008. The senator said he was the only candidate in the race who could assemble the same kind of diverse coalition that pushed Obama to victory 11 years ago.

AD

“This election is about something deeper than any candidate,” Booker said. “It’s about how we can inspire the diverse coalitions we need to inspire.”

In Iowa, Harris, like Booker, had built up a robust organization, including an army of newly energized women supporters who are now up for grabs. During his appearance in Des Moines, Booker was careful not to be seen as capitalizing on Harris’s departure, though his message at times was clearly aimed at making inroads with her supporters and other Democrats who are vexed by the party’s diversity problem.

AD

Speaking to reporters backstage after his event, Booker recounted the frustration and conflicting emotions he’d felt since Harris quit the race. He said he’d fielded phone calls from women of color who, citing Harris, questioned if they would ever be able to run for office and win.

AD

“Something about the system is not fair if she couldn’t even make it to Iowa,” Booker said of Harris.

But Harris’s decision to quit the race was also a moment of opportunity for Booker and Castro, who are vying to keep their presidential bids alive.

Ahead of Booker’s speech, his campaign announced that Wednesday was its biggest fundraising day of the race so far, attracting 11,000 new donors. Castro’s campaign said he had raised more than $360,000 from 18,000 donors since Harris’s exit Tuesday.

AD

But candidates must also hit certain polling targets to qualify, and it’s not clear if Booker or Castro will do that. On Thursday, Booker notably called on his supporters to answer their phones when a pollster called — acknowledging concerns within his campaign that voters besieged by robocalls are simply ignoring unknown numbers and failing to register support that could be crucial for his campaign.

AD

“We’re 1 percentage point in almost all these polls from making the debate stage, which, you know, in a very tight sample size, two people, three people,” Booker told reporters. “And if you’re basing the success of my campaign on a 400-person sample size and three people, your metric is the one that we should be talking about, not mine. I’m basing mine on Iowa voters, Iowa caucusgoers and the kind of campaign that we’re building.”

He declined to say what would happen if he failed to qualify for the December debate.

Nancy Bobo, a Des Moines activist and top Booker supporter, said that she and others who have been knocking on doors on the senator’s behalf in recent days had been instructing anyone they encountered to talk to pollsters if they cared about keeping Booker’s voice in the race.

“Answer your phones,” Bobo said. “Please, please answer your phones.”

A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white.

Democratic contenders who kicked off their campaigns promising to break gender barriers, or rally the rainbow coalition of Barack Obama, instead found themselves fighting concerns that the country’s lingering racism or sexism could help reelect Trump.

AD

“I do think this is a real moment of reckoning in the party,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign who now works for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, most of whose members are immigrants or women of color. “We had the most diverse field in history, and there is an argument that was soundly rejected by voters.”

AD

To a striking degree, Democratic voters appear to be adopting the role of pundits, choosing candidates based on how they believe other voters will act rather than their own preferences, interviews with voters shows.

Still, the nomination is far from settled. Obama trailed Clinton in the polls in late 2007 before going on to win the nomination, and past nominees such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004 came back from polling deficits the preceding fall. But neither of those candidates was excluded from the party’s debates because of low polling, a prospect that has hit some women and nonwhite candidates particularly hard this year.

AD

Currently, six white candidates, including two women and billionaire financier Tom Steyer, have qualified for the December debate. Two others, businessman Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who are of Asian descent, need one more poll at 4 percent to qualify. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who is black, and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, who is Latino, are not likely to make the cut. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is black and who entered the race last month, also is not expected to make the stage.

AD

“We have more billionaires onstage than black people,” said former South Carolina state representative Bakari Sellers, who had endorsed Harris. “The Republican top six candidates at this time in 2016 was more diverse than our top six candidates.”

The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black.

AD

Sellers cautioned against buying into fears that Trump would more easily beat a minority candidate. “Trump is an interesting phenomenon: He has actually put the Democratic Party in what I feel is an untenable position by believing we need a white candidate to win,” he said.

Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who had endorsed Harris, said journalists and others were disproportionately critical of the senator’s campaign.

AD

“I think we as a party give lip service to diversity, but we really care very little about it,” Fudge said. “I would say for the highest-ranking elected black woman in the country to have gotten the kind of dismissal by so many people, I think is nothing more than misogynistic, as well as in some respects quite racist.”

AD

Strategists and candidates blame the struggles of female and minority candidates on a variety of factors. The initial fury of the women’s marches that greeted Trump’s arrival in Washington has faded, they say. Individual weaknesses were shown by candidates like Harris, who struggled to articulate a consistent campaign message, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), who ran an unabashed women-focused campaign that failed to connect with voters.

Others point to media coverage that they say focused on white working-class male voters and suggested the party’s overriding challenge was to win them back. Candidates like Harris, Castro and Booker, in contrast, have run explicitly on their promise to turn out more urban voters in the general election.

AD

“There is a narrative that has developed in the media about who can best take on Donald Trump, about this moderate working-class white voter in the Midwest,” Castro said in an interview. “I don’t recall any articles that have spent nearly as much time figuring out what happened with the decline in the black vote, looking at Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia.”

AD

The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.

“You do hear over and over again from women in focus groups, ‘I would like to see a female president, but I think it would be harder for a woman to win,’ ” said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private surveys. “People are projecting who people will vote for, who they think will win.”

AD

Some Democratic candidates have directly addressed such fears. Both Castro and Booker have regularly urged Democrats to avoid defaulting to a “safe” choice.

AD

“People have been traumatized by a president who often sounds more like George Wallace than we would hope would sound like George Washington,” Booker said in an interview.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has leaned into her history-making quality as potentially the first female president, has made calls for dreaming big and doing hard things a central part of her message. And at the last Democratic debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) tried to dispel doubts that a woman could take on Trump.

“Women are held to a higher standard — otherwise we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Female President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men,” Klobuchar said. She cited the example of the House speaker. “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,” she said.

AD

Karen Finney, a strategist who worked on Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said the recent gains by women and minorities, including the election of Obama and the nomination of Clinton, do not erase the head winds faced by such candidates.

“There is still cultural bias, frankly,” Finney said. “Some of it is unconscious. There is a sexism and some racism about what a leader looks like and who we think can win.”

In public polls, voters give conflicting signals about their association of race and sex with electability. A June Los Angeles Times/USC survey found that when Democratic voters were asked to describe the characteristics of a nominee with the best chance of beating Trump, 68 percent said that imaginary candidate would be white and 70 percent said the person would be a man.

On the other hand, a September Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly 8 in 10 saying a candidate’s race did not matter in his or her ability to defeat Trump, while nearly 7 in 10 said the same about gender.

AD

Booker and Castro have argued that rules of the nominating process have contributed to the struggles of nonwhite candidates. Castro points to the enormous influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, two overwhelmingly white states, on selecting the nominee.

Booker blames the rules for qualifying for the Democratic debates, established by party Chair Tom Perez, which emphasize polls and grass-roots fundraising. Such guidelines favor candidates with a narrow appeal, Booker says, and force campaigns to shift focus away from their field programs to raise more money.

Perez allowed 20 candidates to attend the first debates, and he has been gradually winnowing the stage. All the networks hosting debates are required by the party to have nonwhite and female representation among the moderators.

Booker argued that for the January debate, the qualifications should be changed to include endorsements in Iowa and other factors like whether a candidate is considered a second or third choice in the state.

“It is unacceptable that there is a true competition in Iowa that you will not get to see right before their caucus,” Booker said. “That incongruence is unacceptable.” The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3.

Another obstacle for nonwhite candidates has been the staying power of former vice president Joe Biden. He received 27 percent support from Democratic-leaning voters overall in a late October Washington Post-ABC News poll, but 30 percent support among nonwhites and 39 percent support among blacks. Those numbers may shift if he fails to perform well in the early contests in states such as Iowa, where he is polling lower.

Charles Lewis, chairman of the Greenwood County Democratic Party in South Carolina, said many voters in the first Southern state to cast its primary vote feel safer with Biden’s profile.

“I think because he is, of all things, an older white man and this is the South,” said Lewis, who is African American. “People think they rolled the dice on Obama, but now let’s be safe this time and let’s get something done.”"

THE BIG IDEA: After the 8 1/2-hour impeachment inquiry hearing wrapped up last night, Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) joined the other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee for a news conference. “All I got to say is: If you love America, mamas, don't let your babies grow up to go to Harvard or Stanford law school,” Gohmert said.

Constitutional scholars from those two institutions, invited to testify by the Democrats, had just finished laying out arguments for why President Trump’s conduct warrants impeachment.

Gohmert’s quip was a play on the country song popularized by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in 1978: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. … Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.”

It was a fitting coda to a day that showcased a virulent strain of anti-elitism, even anti-intellectualism, that has flared up as Trump hijacked the GOP from the establishmentarians who once called the shots.

Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the committee, set the tone in his opening statement. “America will see why most people don’t go to law school,” he declared. “No offense to our professors. But please. Really? We’re bringing you in here today to testify on stuff … that we already know, out of the classrooms that maybe you're getting ready for finals in, to discuss things that you probably haven't even had a chance to [read or watch].”

Collins, who just got passed over for a Senate appointment despite Trump pressuring the governor of Georgia to pick him, pooh-poohed a sober-minded discussion about when the Founding Fathers thought impeachment would be advisable as “esoteric.”

Paul Taylor, the chief counsel for Republicans on the committee, suggested as he began questioning the four witnesses that the legal profession as a whole is somehow controlled by the left. He claimed at the start of his questioning – without any citations – that 97 percent of campaign contributions from lawyers during the 2016 presidential campaign went to Hillary Clinton while Trump received only 3 percent. “And the situation is essentially the same at law schools around the country, including those represented on the panel here today,” Taylor said.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who told reporters at the start of the day how much he disliked attending lectures in law school, told Stanford Law School Professor Pamela Karlan that she was unable to see from “the ivory towers of your law school” how condescending she was being to “actual people in this country.”

And so it went.

-- The attacks on law schools and the legal profession in general reflect the broader focus on process and style over substance in Trump’s defense strategy. There is little dispute about the underlying facts of the case, even as a growing body of evidence directly ties Trump to an alleged conspiracy to coerce the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into a 2020 challenger, former vice president Joe Biden, in exchange for transferring nearly $400 million of military aid, which Congress had already approved, and scheduling a coveted meeting with a neophyte president who was desperate to project strength in the face of an ongoing Russian occupation in his country.

-- Marginalizing experts and debasing expertise have been hallmarks of the Trump presidency. Trump doesn’t just reject climate science. His administration has suppressed research. He’s purged nonpartisan experts from an array of government agencies. He still refuses to accept the consensus of the professionals in the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy.

The manager of Trump’s reelection campaign, Brad Parscale, referred to the scholars invited by Democrats to testify as “the Three Stooges” on Twitter. “Just more of the same old sham!” he wrote.

-- The criticism of the professional class offers another proof point to illustrate why so many white-collar suburbanites who have traditionally supported Republicans have defected during the Trump era. But Trump has proven to also be a magnet for non-college-educated whites in the Rust Belt who are ancestrally Democratic, accelerating a once-in-a-generation realignment.

-- Karlan replied forcefully to Collins’s suggestion that she knew not of what she spoke. “I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts. I’m insulted by the suggestion that, as a law professor, I don’t care about the facts,” Karlan said. “I spent all of Thanksgiving vacation sitting there, reading these transcripts. … I ate, like, a turkey that came to us in the mail that was already cooked because I was spending my time doing this.”

-- Rank-and-file Republicans have soured considerably on the value of colleges and universities in recent years. A Pew Research Center study published in August showed that only 33 percent of Republicans see value in higher education, down from 53 percent in 2012. “Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) say professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom is a major reason why the higher education system is headed in the wrong direction (only 17% of Democrats say the same),” according to Pew. “And three-quarters of Republicans (vs. 31% of Democrats) point to too much concern about protecting students from views they might find offensive as a major reason for their views.”

-- The criticism of the legal profession came even though 15 of the 17 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee hold law degrees. Overall, 161 House members and 53 senators earned juris doctorates, according to the Congressional Research Service.

-- House Democrats signaled there will be at least one article of impeachment related to the 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller’s report. “President Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election. He demanded it for the 2020 election. In both cases, he got caught,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

-- University of North Carolina Law Professor Michael Gerhardt, one of the witnesses, testified that an obstruction case against Trump is a slam dunk, citing the administration’s stated refusal to comply with any subpoenas for documents and depositions. “In our law schools, we would teach our students this is an easy, straightforward situation,” he said.

Gerhardt also argued that what Trump asked of the Ukrainians is impeachable, as well. “I just want to stress that if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" he said. “This is precisely the misconduct that the Framers created a Constitution including impeachment to protect against. … If we cannot impeach a president who uses his power for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy.”

-- Even the witness that Republicans invited to testify, George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley, said that Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “anything but perfect.” But Turley argued that it’s not impeachable and accused Democrats of rushing to impeach without the testimony of key witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo – who are refusing, at Trump’s direction, to appear.“If you rush this impeachment, you’re going to leave half the country behind,” he said.He later called the Democratic case “not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous.”

-- “Impeachment goes to college” is how Dan Zak and Ben Terris framed the hearing in their write-up for the Style section: “After last month’s testimony from bow-tied diplomats and stone-faced bureaucrats — ‘fact witnesses’ who actually saw or heard Trump’s inciting behavior — the impeachment process has reached the peer-review phase. During this hearing, professors referenced a 1640 sermon by John Winthrop and a 1792 edition of Samuel Johnson’s dictionary. There were multiple odes to forgotten founder William Richardson Davie, the onetime governor of North Carolina who argued fiercely for an impeachment provision in drafts of the Constitution. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) had in front of him a tattered college copy of the Federalist Papers, scrawled with marginalia.”

-- When he got a chance to question Karlan, Gaetz noted that the professor has given campaign contributions to Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He asked her about a comment she made on a podcast that suggested liberals cluster in tighter communities while conservatives tend to spread out. “Do you understand how that reflects contempt on people who are conservative?” Gaetz asked. “No, what I was talking about there was the natural tendency -- if you put the quote in context – the natural tendency of a compactness requirement to favor a party whose voters are more spread out,” she answered. “I do not have contempt for conservatives.”

Karlan later apologized for “getting a little overheated.” She also apologized for quipping earlier in the day that “the president can name his son Barron,” but he can’t make him a baron. “It was wrong of me to do that,” she said, after Republicans attacked her. “I wish the president would apologize, obviously, for the things that he's done that are wrong, but I do regret having said that.”

“That does not lend credibility to your argument,” Gaetz told her. “It makes you look mean.”

-- One Republican on the committee also floated a new defense of the president: Everybody does it. Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said that basically every president could have been impeached under the standards cited by Democrats for abuse of power. “When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he was president, directed the IRS to conduct audits of his political enemies ... would that be impeachable conduct?” Buck asked Turley. “How about when President Kennedy directed his brother, Robert Kennedy, to deport one of his mistresses as an East German spy?”

“Turley said he couldn’t rule it out, nor could he do so when Buck asked about allegations that President Lyndon Johnson used the CIA to plant a spy in the campaign of his 1964 Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater,” Mike DeBonis notes. “Buck ultimately landed on Obama, pointing to his interpretation of the recess appointments power that was later rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court, as well as his response to the 2012 Benghazi attack.”

“Can you name a single president in the history of the United States — save President [William Henry] Harrison, who died 32 days after his inauguration — that would not have met the standard of impeachment for our friends here?” Buck asked.

“I would hope to God James Madison would escape,” said Turley, who has written about Madison. “Otherwise, a lifetime of academic work would be shredded. But once again, I can’t exclude many of these acts.”

Buck reasoned that, if Democrats impeach Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine, Republicans will impeach the next Democratic president if they have control of the House because the concept of what’s in the “national interest” is so open for debate.

“Some people live in an ivory tower and some people live in a swamp,” Buck said. “And those of us that are in the swamp are doing our very best for the American people, but it’s not pretty.”

“Well, actually, I live in an ivory tower in a swamp because I'm at G.W.,” Turley replied. “But it's not so bad.”

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATIONS:

-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a brief speech this morning that she’s asked House committee chairs to proceed with articles of impeachment, saying lawmakers have “no choice but to act.” “The president has engaged in abuse of power undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections,” she said. “His actions are in defiance of the vision of our founders and the oath of office that he takes to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our Founders and our heart full of love for America, today I’m asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.” She didn’t give any indication of how quickly the process would move.

-- Attorney General Bill Barr’s handpicked prosecutor, John Durham, told Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that he can’t back up the right-wing conspiracy theory that the Russia investigation was a setup by American intelligence. Horowitz’s office contacted Durham, “the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett scoop. “The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz’s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign … But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets … And Durham informed Horowitz’s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general’s findings on that point. … That could rebut conservatives’ doubts — which Barr has shared with associates in recent weeks — that Horowitz might be blessing the FBI’s Russia investigation prematurely and that Durham could potentially find more, particularly with regard to the Maltese professor.”

-- Rudy Giuliani, trying to poke holes in the case against his client, is in Kyiv and Budapest this week to talk with former Ukrainian prosecutors. From the Times’ Ken Vogel and Benjamin Novak: “Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk … Mr. Giuliani is using the trip … to help prepare more episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative. His latest moves to advance the theories propounded by the prosecutors amount to an audacious effort to give the president’s supporters new material to undercut the House impeachment proceedings and an eventual Senate trial.”

-- The White House is preparing for an aggressive effort to defend Trump in the Senate. Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian report: “Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs, told reporters that Trump ‘wants his case made fully in the Senate,’ previewing a strategy that would include live witnesses on the floor, rather than videotaped depositions that were entered into evidence during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999. … Ueland was among a quartet of top White House officials, including Counsel Pat Cipollone, who met with GOP senators on Wednesday as the administration continues to strategize with Republicans on the Senate proceedings. The private session … underscored the extent to which Trump has largely blown off the House inquiry and is focusing on a likely trial in the GOP-controlled Senate, where the White House says he would get a fair defense and can easily win an acquittal.”

-- But Trump opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee’s first hearing, unlike Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. Paul Kane reports: “Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump’s side.”

-- Joe Biden said he would not voluntarily appear as a witness in a Senate impeachment trial if called to testify. Colby Itkowitz reports: “‘No, I’m not going to let them take their eye off the ball,’ Biden said [in Iowa]. … ‘The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes. And I’m not going to let them divert from that, I’m not going to let anyone divert from that.’ Biden added that he’d released 21 years of his tax returns, so if Trump is worried about corruption, ‘let him release some of his.’”

-- Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) announced he will not seek reelection. From Politico: “Heck, 67, was first elected in 2012 to represent a [solidly blue] district southwest of Seattle. He said in a Medium post he had time over the Thanksgiving recess for ‘rest and reflection,’ which led to his retirement decision. … Heck also wrote that the process of compiling the intelligence committee's recent impeachment report had left him ‘discouraged’ about continuing to serve in Congress. ‘The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary,’ Heck wrote. ‘I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president’s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.’”

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED:

-- Undocumented workers who served Trump recall his habits and outbursts: Joshua Partlow and Dave Fahrenthold have interviewed 48 people this year who worked illegally for the Trump Organization at 11 of its properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Virginia: “They have seen poolside tantrums and holiday arguments. They’ve laughed with the in-laws and watched after the grandkids. Their recollections also show how Trump’s entrance into presidential politics — denouncing illegal immigrants as criminals and job-stealers — upended their lives and prompted some of them to publicly confront their former boss.” Here are choice nuggets from their must-read piece:

“It was important for Sandra Diaz to be invisible. Before entering the Trump family villa, she would tie back her hair, pull on latex gloves and step into delicate paper shoe coverings. She knew not to wear makeup or perfume that might leave the faintest trace of her presence. As Donald Trump’s personal housekeeper, Diaz was dealing with a fussy celebrity owner who presided like a monarch over the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster long before he was elevated to president. She was an immigrant from Costa Rica working illegally for Trump with a fake Social Security card she had bought for $50. Being invisible was her life’s work. Moving quickly through the two-story house in the mornings, Diaz carried out Trump’s fastidious instructions. In his closet, she would hang six sets of identical golf outfits: six white polo shirts, six pairs of beige pants, six neatly ironed pairs of boxer shorts. …

“Those who cooked and served Trump knew that he liked … his Diet Coke in small glass bottles with a plastic straw that no one could be seen touching. Trump loved Tic Tacs. But not an arbitrary amount. He wanted, in his bedroom bureau at all times, two full containers of white Tic Tacs and one container that was half full. The same rule applied to the Bronx Colors-brand face makeup from Switzerland that Trump slathered on — two full containers, one half full — even if it meant the housekeepers had to regularly bring new shirts from the pro shop because of the rust-colored stains on the collars. A special washing machine in the laundry room was reserved for his wife Melania Trump’s clothing. Donald Trump liked Irish Spring bar soap in his shower. But his housekeepers quickly learned not to throw out his soap even if it had worn down to the tiniest sliver: Trump decided when he wanted something discarded. When that happened, with clothes or newspapers, he would toss them on the floor.

“A regular recipient of Trump’s castoff clothing was Melania’s father, Viktor Knavs … ‘They’re the same size and everything,’ [said Victorina Morales, Diaz’s successor as Trump’s housekeeper at Bedminster]. Knavs and his wife, Amalija Knavs, were favorites of the Bedminster staff, even if much was lost in translation from Slovenian to Spanish. … One day in 2013, Viktor Knavs went out to play golf wearing one of Trump’s discarded red baseball caps. When Trump spotted him on the fairway, he blew up, and he ordered his father-in-law, in front of other golfers, to remove the hat and get off the course. … Diaz and Morales were in the villa when Knavs returned, threw the hat on the ground and cursed Trump. The housekeepers pieced together the story from what Amalija Knavs told them in English and what they heard from the caddies who were on the course at the time. ‘Nobody could wear the red hat but [Trump],’ Diaz said.”

-- The Post’s year-long investigation on Trump’s employment of undocumented workers has led to these five additional findings:

At least 11 Trump properties hired undocumented workers, some who said they started working for Trump 17 years ago. Trump said in July he wasn't sure if his company employed undocumented workers. But many former workers said it's hard to believe that the managers didn't know. The Trump Organization didn’t face many legal consequences for using undocumented labor. The workers, however, have lost their jobs and have found it hard to get back on their feet after being fired by the organization. Some have also been ostracized by other undocumented workers who fear that the attention might put them at greater deportation risk. While some of the undocumented workers entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, others arrived on flights with tourist visas that they overstayed. In those cases, Trump’s promised border wall wouldn’t have mattered.

-- A gunman opened fire at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam near Honolulu, killing two and injuring a third before killing himself, base officials said. Reis Thebault and Marisa Iati report: “The shooter was identified as an active-duty U.S. Navy sailor and the three victims as civilian Defense Department employees working on the base’s shipyard. The surviving victim is at a hospital in stable condition, Rear Adm. Robb Chadwick said in a Wednesday evening news conference. The shooter’s motive is still unknown, Chadwick said, and it wasn’t yet clear whether the attack was targeted or random.”

-- Birds are getting smaller, and scientists believe it’s because of global warming. Ben Guarino reports: “So shows an analysis of migratory birds that died after colliding into buildings in Chicago and were collected as specimens for the Field Museum of Natural History. David Willard, a Field Museum ornithologist, has measured the Windy City’s dead birds since 1978. Data from his calipers and scales reveal decades-long trends in bird bodies: Their legs, on average, are growing shorter. They have lost weight. Their wings are getting slightly longer. These changes are present in nearly all of the species he measured, according to a study of 70,716 bird specimens from almost 40 years published Wednesday in the journal Ecology Letters. Morphing birds, Willard and his colleagues say, reflect a changing climate. ‘Warming temperatures seem to be having a pretty consistent and almost universal effect on a large number of different species, regardless of other aspects of their biology,’ said study author Benjamin Winger, who studies the evolution and ecology of birds at the University of Michigan.”

-- The freak storms of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season have left behind a trail of destruction. Matthew Cappucci reports: “Both Dorian and Lorenzo, which became the strongest hurricane to develop so far northeast in the Atlantic, attained Category 5 strength. The storms brought the count of Category 5s in the Atlantic since 2016 up to six, and marked the fourth year in a row with at least one Category 5, the longest stretch on record. The historic intensity of both Dorian and Lorenzo, along with the record-setting rains produced by storms Barry and Imelda in the United States, exhibited influences consistent with warming ocean waters and climate change. … This year had an above-average season. It was only the seventh season since the 1930s to rack up multiple Category 5s over the Atlantic Basin. Across the board, 24 percent more ‘accumulated cyclone energy’ than average was expended by storms this season. It also brought about one of the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfalls on record. But many in the United States view the season as a reprieve for the storm-beleaguered country, noting that only two hurricanes made landfall in the United States this season, along with one tropical storm. Both hurricanes were at Category 1 strength when they did so. The year was still incredibly active; the contiguous United States just got lucky.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Trump administration is considering sending 14,000 more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran. From the Wall Street Journal: “The deployment could double the number of U.S. military personnel who have been sent to the region since the start of a troop buildup in May. [Trump] is expected to make a decision on the new deployments as soon as this month … There is growing fear among U.S. military and other administration officials that an attack on U.S. interests and forces could leave the U.S. with few options in the region ... By sending additional military resources to the region, the administration would be presenting a more credible deterrent to Tehran, which has been blamed for a series of attacks, including one in September against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied involvement.”

-- U.S. intelligence officials believe Iran is secretly moving missiles into Iraq. From the New York Times: “New intelligence about Iran’s stockpiling of missiles in Iraq is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s efforts to deter Tehran by increasing the American military presence in the Middle East has largely failed. The missiles pose a threat to American allies and partners in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and could endanger American troops ... Both Iran and Iraq have been gripped in recent weeks by sometimes violent public protests. In Iraq, some are protesting against Iranian influence.”

-- German authorities said they suspect that Russian agents were behind an execution-style killing in Berlin in the summer and expelled two Russian diplomats in connection with the case. Loveday Morris reports from Berlin and Robyn Dixon reports from Moscow: “The federal public prosecutor said there was ‘sufficient factual evidence’ that the Aug. 23 killing was carried out by Russian intelligence agencies or those of Russia’s Chechen Republic. The German Foreign Ministry declared two employees of the Russian Embassy in Berlin ‘persona non gratae,’ saying that Russian authorities have not cooperated with the investigation ‘sufficiently’ despite repeated ‘high-ranking’ requests. The killing compounds concerns about Russia’s efforts to assassinate political opponents on European soil less than two years after Britain accused Moscow of attacking former Russian agent turned informant Sergei Skripal with nerve agent in Salisbury, England. … [This] would represent the first such slaying on German soil since the end of the Cold War. It threatens to stymie relations between Berlin and Moscow, a fragile bond for Germany, which tries to balance political differences against its energy needs.

“Berlin prosecutors named the victim, who was shot in the head in a central Berlin park, as ‘Tornike K.’ — a 40-year-old Russian-Georgian citizen … Between 2000 and 2004, he commanded a Chechen militia that fought Russian forces during the Russian-Chechen war … The slain man also fought with a Georgian unit defending South Ossetia during the 2008 Georgia-Russia war … He survived a 2015 assassination attempt, despite being shot four times, and later fled to Germany, where he claimed asylum. … [H]e was tailed by a man on an electric bicycle before being shot with a Glock-26 pistol.” This is right out of the Kremlin's playbook.

-- Ukranian and Russian leaders will try to seal a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and agree on prisoner swaps when they meet next week. From Reuters: “With Kiev politically constrained and Moscow unlikely to bend, prospects for peace remain bleak, diplomats said. … Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions. Key to the accords are elections in the disputed eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. But both sides accuse each other of failing to stick to the deal, which includes restoring Ukrainian state control over the entire border with Russia and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the conflict zone.”

-- As the NATO summit concluded, ""Trump abruptly canceled a planned news conference, saying that he had already answered so many questions from reporters in other settings during his visit to Britain. He took off for Washington,"" Michael Birnbaum, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report from London. ""Though his conduct here fit his pattern of disruption at international summits, Trump did not make the fiery threats that have punctuated previous gatherings. NATO leaders were almost giddy as they survived another encounter with Trump with their alliance intact. Trump’s canceled news conference — eliminating one last chance for him to take aim at them — was to many the departure gift.”

-- The British Conservative Party breathed a sigh of relief after Trump left the U.K. without smashing its election strategy. From Politico: “It means [Boris Johnson] survived the Trump visit without any extra obstacles being put in his way ahead of the December 12 vote. … Johnson spent two days working hard to avoid being pictured with Trump, who is deeply unpopular in the U.K. He did not greet the president at the door of Downing Street when world leaders arrived for a reception on Wednesday night. The only photos of Johnson and Trump together were the full NATO group shot and the obligatory opening handshake snap.”

-- France is bracing for massive transportation disruptions starting today as trade unions launch a strike in response to changes Emmanuel Macron wants to make to the country’s retirement system. James McAuley reports: “Much of the Paris Metro will be shut down, as will many national and international train lines, including certain Eurostar services. Flights also will be canceled, as air traffic controllers say they will join the protests through Saturday. Strikes and protests, of course, are a well-known fixture of French life, from the student uprisings of 1968 to the ‘yellow vest’ demonstrations against inequality that stunned the French government last year with their vigor and violence. No other Western democracy seems to have as high a tolerance for burning cars and broken windows. But these protests could be bigger and more destabilizing than most.”

-- Australia is blocking asylum seekers held offshore from seeking medical care in the country. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton claims the policy has helped people migrate into Australia ‘through the back door.’ Physicians and refugee advocates say it has saved sick asylum seekers’ lives. And Wednesday, Australian lawmakers voted narrowly to revoke the policy, in what Doctors Without Borders described as a move that ‘endangers patients in need and ignores the ethical framework of the entire medical profession.’ At least 135 asylum seekers have sought treatment or assessment in Australia since the policy was approved this year. The law required physicians to deem their transfer to Australia necessary. It is unclear whether these asylum seekers are still in Australia.”

2020 WATCH:

-- The Democratic candidates have joined a new race – courting supporters of Kamala Harris. Annie Linskey, Chelsea Janes and Holly Bailey report: “Harris’s abrupt departure from the 2020 Democratic contest unleashed a massive scramble among the remaining candidates for her vast field of organizers, local leaders, staff and donors. And it prompted soul searching among her backers and her fans about who they might back next. … The competition for her backers, especially African American women, is particularly fierce given the delicate racial dynamics of the remaining Democratic field, which polls show is now led by four white candidates. All are trying to either cement or make inroads among African American voters. At least initially, the campaigns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and [Biden] appeared likely to benefit. Biden already has strong support among black voters, and Warren has been seeking to expand her reach, particularly among African American women. The competition to pick up Harris’s campaign apparatus was so intense that Sue Dvorsky, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Harris backer, blasted other campaigns for targeting the soon-to-be-unemployed Harris staffers.”

-- Democrats were once excited about their diverse candidate field. That thrill is gone. Michael Scherer reports: “A party that began the presidential cycle having elected more women and minorities to Congress than at any point in history has largely shunned those candidates so far in the presidential campaign, pushing several from the race or the debate lineup. Some activists worry that the Dec. 19 debate could be all-white. … The Republican debate in December 2015 included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are Latino, and Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development, who is black. … The most common explanation, however, has focused on a fear that pops up regularly in focus groups and voter interviews. Both black and white voters regularly express concern that a white man would be best able to take on Trump, given that the general election campaign could awaken the same explosive racial and gender dynamics that characterized the 2016 campaign. Clinton’s loss, which some Democrats blame at least partly on sexism, remains fresh in many minds.”

-- Biden said he would consider Harris as a potential running mate. From CNN: “‘Of course I would,’ Biden said. ‘Look, Sen. Harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. I mean it sincerely. I talked to her yesterday. She's solid, she can be president someday herself, she can be vice president, she could go on to be a Supreme Court justice, she could be attorney general. I mean she has enormous capability.’”

-- The former vice president has not been energizing voters during his week-long bus tour around Iowa. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “The ‘No Malarkey’ tour, which continues through Saturday, is intended as a show of stamina for Biden, 77, who has fallen behind in early state polls after some shaky debate performances and rising concerns about his strength as a candidate. In Iowa, where the all-important caucuses are less than two months away, Biden was the acknowledged leader when he entered the race in April — but now he trails [Pete] Buttigieg and has been locked in a tight race with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Then, in stop after stop this week, Biden sought to pump new life into his campaign. He has told voters who braved freezing temperatures and icy roads that he is the most palatable option for a diverse coalition of Democrats, and that he is the best choice to woo Republicans and independents wary of President Trump. His crowds have been small and low-key, a contrast to the more energetic events orchestrated by his competitors...""

-- Camping out in New Hampshire: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard rented a small house outside of Manchester, N.H., for the last months before the primary. From WMUR9: “‘We had a town hall in Rochester and then in Gilford right before the storm hit, and people said, 'You must be getting out of town,' and nope, we're here for the duration,’ Gabbard said. Gabbard tweeted out a photo of a snowbound yoga session at her new place Tuesday.”

-- A Republican House candidate called for Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (D-Minn.) execution. Katie Mettler and Hannah Knowles report: “In a fundraising letter sent last week and first reported on Tuesday by the Tampa Bay Times, the campaign of George Buck, a St. Petersburg Republican running for Congress, repeated falsehoods about Omar’s alleged ties to foreign nations. ‘We should hang these traitors where they stand,’ the email said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In an initial comment to that newspaper, Buck denied writing the campaign email, which arrived in the form of a letter and bore his signature. ‘That was not me. I did not see that,’ Buck told Times reporter Steve Contorno. ‘I would never talk like that.’ But Buck sent another statement later in the day that cited the federal punishment for treason, which includes death, prison time of at least five years and a fine of not less than $10,000. … House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) disavowed Buck’s words in a statement Wednesday, saying ‘there’s no place for inciting violence in politics.’”

-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) shows no signs of voluntarily resigning from the House, despite his guilty plea to a felony campaign finance charge. From Politico: “When asked Wednesday about whether and when he intended to resign, Hunter blew off the question. ‘Good talk,’ Hunter told a Politico reporter. So far, neither Republican nor Democratic leaders have pressured Hunter to leave office, although there is precedent for expelling members who don’t step down following a criminal conviction. Hunter is not scheduled to be sentenced until March 17.”
