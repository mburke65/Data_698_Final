Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

Ms. Harris’s third-quarter number is far below what some other candidates reported this week: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., raised $19.1 million; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced an eye-popping $25.3 million haul, the largest of any candidate this cycle. Two other top tier candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have yet to release their third-quarter totals.

Ms. Harris’s total for the second quarter of the year was $11.8 million, helped by a strong online donation push in the final days. This quarter, which included a summer largely spent at a slew of closed-door events and away from the campaign trail , Ms. Harris has seen her financial standing hold steady even as her political prospects fell.

Mr. Trump’s fund-raising effort included several recent emails, tweets and text messages urging supporters to donate to help protect his presidency after House Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry into the president’s dealings with Ukraine and other matters.

Officials said that the various Trump-related committees have raised a combined $308 million this year, and have $156 million in cash on hand.

People sometimes ask how I stay optimistic when I cover war, genocide and poverty. The answer is simple: Side by side with the worst of humanity, you encounter the best. I’ve made repeated trips to the rebel-held Nuba Mountains of Sudan, where the government dropped bombs and starved villagers, and there I met an extraordinary human being, Dr. Tom Catena, who has devoted his life to providing medical care as the bombs fall around him. A Muslim paramount chief told me that “Dr. Tom,” as he is known, heals the sick and lets the lame walk — and thus “He’s Jesus Christ.” On one trip to the Nuba Mountains, I was sickened to visit an extended family that had lost six children to a bomb but also moved that Dr. Tom had managed to save three others. So I return from a war zone like that scarred by the pain I’ve witnessed, but also uplifted by the goodness, strength and decency shown by people like Dr. Tom — and actually feeling better about humanity.

5 Minutes, $25 and a New Life

Another reason for optimism: I have seen immense progress in my 35 years of covering the world. On my first travels to poor countries, as a law student, I was pained by the number of blind people I saw led around by their children or grandchildren. Many were blind from cataracts, and in 2015 I met a remarkable Nepali doctor, Sanduk Ruit, who has pioneered a way to perform five-minute cataract surgery without electricity or advanced facilities for only $25 a patient. He has personally performed more than 120,000 cataract surgeries. You cannot watch Dr. Ruit’s patients take off their bandages and smile giddily as they see clearly for the first time in many years without feeling a rush of warmth about our world.

An Innocent Man Facing Death?

Beginning in 2010, I wrote a number of times about a black man named Kevin Cooper who I believe was framed for murder by the San Bernardino County sheriff’s office in California, where he is now on death row. The articles didn’t get much traction or readership, but the more I reported on the subject the more aware I became that there are many people on death row after dubious convictions. So last year, with the help of Times colleagues who are experts in visual journalism, I conducted a thorough investigation of the Cooper case and published the results. We called on the authorities to allow advanced DNA testing in the case (Kamala Harris and Jerry Brown had previously refused to allow the testing). It may have been the longest opinion column The Times ever published. The upshot is that advanced DNA testing is now finally underway, and I’m praying that after 36 years in prison Cooper may finally get justice — along with those who framed him. Here’s the investigation.

The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com."

I used to think calling cars “death machines” was kind of extreme. Then my niece was hit by one.

She was only 9 years old, out with her family in Los Angeles and running toward an ice cream truck. She was hit with such force that most of her front teeth were knocked out. She is lucky to be alive.

Thinking about my niece made me recall all the other times members of my family had been injured by cars. My husband’s grandmother was killed. My aunt and uncle were seriously injured. I was even involved in a hit-and-run in a crosswalk in front of my school when I was a kid and broke my leg.

Most of us have stories like this — a car coming into our lives and unleashing horrendous damage on our loved ones, friends, family and even ourselves.

Cars are death machines. Pedestrian fatalities in the United States have increased 41 percent since 2008; more than 6,000 pedestrians were killed in 2018 alone. More than 4,000 American kids are killed in car crashes every year – I am thankful every day my niece wasn’t one of them.

Here’s the thing: Statistics clearly don’t seem to persuade anyone of the magnitude of this problem. Not policy makers or automakers, technologists or drivers.

If numbers don’t change minds, can personal experiences?

I conducted an experiment on Twitter this summer, asking people to share my tweet if a car had hit them, or anyone they knew. It was shared thousands of times and more than 500 people shared stories of being hit, losing family and friends, and sustaining injuries that impact their daily lives.

A driver bolted toward traffic without stopping at the stop sign. He hit me broadside, sending me into traffic that was thankfully empty at the moment. The next thing I remember was being helped onto the grass with my bent-up bike and someone asking me where I lived. I was in 5th grade at the time. That's only one of three stories I have. Alexandra Watson, Boulder, CO Nick Cote for The New York Times I was hit by a car when I was 15. Riding a bike down a street near my house, a car turned left in front of me. I survived only because the hood was low and broad enough that I catapulted over it rather than impacting the side. Skip Pile A truck pulled up alongside me at a red light. When the light turned green, I started going, but was whacked on the back of my head by a side mirror (I think), was sent into the right lane, bounced off the side, and, still fighting to keep upright, finally fell — under the moving gravel truck. I ended up with a broken pelvis and an education in how judges assign liability. Dan Turner, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times I was “doored” by a car twice and hit in a crosswalk — all on bikes. Don’t tell my mom. Molly Cohen I was hit by cars while on a bike three times in two years in L.A. Two right-hooks, one road-raged me into a row of parked cars. Hit once on San Pablo in Oakland: a thrown-open door that I bent all the way back and flipped over the top. He demanded I pay to repair his car door and threatened to get his gun before he ran. Christopher Kidd, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times

There are many who say that autonomous or smart cars will solve this. So far, I’m unpersuaded. Since 2014, over $80 billion dollars has been spent on “smart” or connected cars (more on these in a minute) and autonomous vehicles, arguably to make cars safer. But investing in the car of the future is investing in the wrong problem. We need to be thinking about how we can create a world with fewer cars.

Among the safety measures proposed by car companies are encouraging pedestrians and bicyclists to use R.F.I.D. tags, which emit signals that cars can detect. This means it’s becoming the pedestrian’s responsibility to avoid getting hit. But if keeping people safe means putting the responsibility on them (or worse, criminalizing walking and biking), we need to think twice about the technology we’re developing.

This may be the worst outcome of the automobile-centered 20th century: the assumption that it’s people who need to get out of the way of these lethal machines, instead of the other way around.

I was biking in the street after work when a car pulled out of a parking garage without looking and clipped my back tire. I went down, but fortunately only did some deep tissue damage that healed in a week. My bike tires were pretty bent and had to be replaced; I was a lucky one. J. R. Raith I was hit by a car in July 2017 in San Francisco. I was getting out of an Uber and the driver, who just dropped me off, backed over me as I waited to cross the street. Danny Harris, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times Two years ago, a drunk driver ran over me with his pickup truck. He kept going — hit and run. No one on the scene thought I'd make it. The doctors didn't believe I'd make it. I had skull fractures, a broken jaw in three places and wired shut, a punched lung with added tracheotomy. I was in a coma for a week, and woke up alone. Ryan Cary Wear I was hit by a car when I was 11, in Queens. I was knocked to the ground, but otherwise unhurt because the car was moving slowly. The driver got out and made sure I was O.K. before leaving. Three of my friends (one pedestrian and two cyclists, all adults) were killed by cars. Lauren Weinberg, Waterloo, Ontario Tara Walton for The New York Times

Many so-called advances in car design may, thus far, be making things much worse. The internet-equipped “connected car,” for example, initially introduced by Cadillac in 1996 as a luxury safety feature known as OnStar, has morphed into something else entirely. Increasingly large and complicated dashboard screens take cognitive resources away from the task at hand, which is driving, and have the potential to be as dangerous as texting while driving.

Just as all these interested parties scramble to make cars more technologically complex, they’ve gone all-in on making them bigger, much bigger. Americans are buying — and car manufacturers are producing — more S.U.V.s than ever before, a shift that has led to a 69 percent increase in pedestrian fatalities, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.

Because the front end of an S.U.V. is higher than the average car’s front end, it is far more likely to hit a pedestrian in the chest or head and twice as likely to kill walkers, runners, cyclists and children, compared to regular cars. And yet, S.U.V. sales account for 60 percent of new vehicle sales.

One of the easiest ways to make cars safer would be to make them smaller. Another way? Figuring out how to get people to drive less by providing safer, more sustainable alternatives to the car.

I was hit by a car when a lady had a seizure and ran headlong into me. It’s been over nine years now. I had one cervical spine surgery and need another. I have headaches every day and terrible neurological symptoms. I used public transit for years when I was more able-bodied, and fewer cars isn't the answer when you have disabilities. Erin Gilmer Once as a cyclist in the ’burbs. Once as a pedestrian in Brooklyn. And another time as a cyclist in Brooklyn, I was forced off the road into a parked car Ronald Marans, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times I've been hit by cars twice in San Francisco. Both in the Mission District. Both drivers were making illegal left turns into me. Both drivers were irate that my body impact damaged their car. Jeff Tumlin I was hit while cycling by a left-turning truck driver who said I ""came out of nowhere."" I was airlifted to the hospital and had seven broken bones, five surgeries, spent three months in hospital, one year in a wheelchair. The driver went to jail ... Just kidding, of course he only got a ticket. No real consequences. Lou Savastani, Narberth, PA Mark Makela for The New York Times I got knocked down by a taxi that sped off outside Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakech, Morocco. A lovely rug merchant rushed over, insisted I drink his tonic water for the “quinine.” I said “Shukran! But I don’t think I got malaria.” Yet I was revived and appreciate his kindness. Lila Kerns My 12-year-old son was killed in a crash in front of our home on Oct. 8, 2013. Sammy kissed me goodbye and said, “I love you Mommy.” I never imagined those would be his last words. Sammy was bright, kind, athletic and had a huge heart. We miss him every day. After his death, I joined with others and helped found Families for Safe Streets in N.Y.C. Amy Cohen, New York City Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times

I’m not so naïve to think we can get rid of cars altogether, but we have so many tools to eliminate traffic-related injuries and fatalities right now. Banning all passenger auto-driving vehicles above a certain weight and front grill height would be a great start. Other solutions run the gamut from the quick and easy fixes — like reducing speed limits, eliminating right turns on red, building protected bike lanes and instituting congestion pricing — to major and necessary commitments like funding new transit projects (upgrading, maintaining and expanding existing transit systems) and rethinking land use to encourage walkable development rather than sprawl.

We can all commit to driving less, which reduces both CO2 emissions and the potential for crashes. We need to be as defensive about crosswalks and bike lanes as drivers are about their cars (and where we believe we are entitled to park them).

Until then, the streets will belong to the death machines."

I conducted an experiment on Twitter this summer, asking people to share my tweet if a car had hit them, or anyone they knew. It was shared thousands of times and more than 500 people shared stories of being hit, losing family and friends, and sustaining injuries that impact their daily lives.

A driver bolted toward traffic without stopping at the stop sign. He hit me broadside, sending me into traffic that was thankfully empty at the moment. The next thing I remember was being helped onto the grass with my bent-up bike and someone asking me where I lived. I was in 5th grade at the time. That's only one of three stories I have. Alexandra Watson, Boulder, CO Nick Cote for The New York Times I was hit by a car when I was 15. Riding a bike down a street near my house, a car turned left in front of me. I survived only because the hood was low and broad enough that I catapulted over it rather than impacting the side. Skip Pile A truck pulled up alongside me at a red light. When the light turned green, I started going, but was whacked on the back of my head by a side mirror (I think), was sent into the right lane, bounced off the side, and, still fighting to keep upright, finally fell — under the moving gravel truck. I ended up with a broken pelvis and an education in how judges assign liability. Dan Turner, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times I was “doored” by a car twice and hit in a crosswalk — all on bikes. Don’t tell my mom. Molly Cohen I was hit by cars while on a bike three times in two years in L.A. Two right-hooks, one road-raged me into a row of parked cars. Hit once on San Pablo in Oakland: a thrown-open door that I bent all the way back and flipped over the top. He demanded I pay to repair his car door and threatened to get his gun before he ran. Christopher Kidd, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times

There are many who say that autonomous or smart cars will solve this. So far, I’m unpersuaded. Since 2014, over $80 billion dollars has been spent on “smart” or connected cars (more on these in a minute) and autonomous vehicles, arguably to make cars safer. But investing in the car of the future is investing in the wrong problem. We need to be thinking about how we can create a world with fewer cars.

Among the safety measures proposed by car companies are encouraging pedestrians and bicyclists to use R.F.I.D. tags, which emit signals that cars can detect. This means it’s becoming the pedestrian’s responsibility to avoid getting hit. But if keeping people safe means putting the responsibility on them (or worse, criminalizing walking and biking), we need to think twice about the technology we’re developing.

This may be the worst outcome of the automobile-centered 20th century: the assumption that it’s people who need to get out of the way of these lethal machines, instead of the other way around.

I was biking in the street after work when a car pulled out of a parking garage without looking and clipped my back tire. I went down, but fortunately only did some deep tissue damage that healed in a week. My bike tires were pretty bent and had to be replaced; I was a lucky one. J. R. Raith I was hit by a car in July 2017 in San Francisco. I was getting out of an Uber and the driver, who just dropped me off, backed over me as I waited to cross the street. Danny Harris, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times Two years ago, a drunk driver ran over me with his pickup truck. He kept going — hit and run. No one on the scene thought I'd make it. The doctors didn't believe I'd make it. I had skull fractures, a broken jaw in three places and wired shut, a punched lung with added tracheotomy. I was in a coma for a week, and woke up alone. Ryan Cary Wear I was hit by a car when I was 11, in Queens. I was knocked to the ground, but otherwise unhurt because the car was moving slowly. The driver got out and made sure I was O.K. before leaving. Three of my friends (one pedestrian and two cyclists, all adults) were killed by cars. Lauren Weinberg, Waterloo, Ontario Tara Walton for The New York Times

Many so-called advances in car design may, thus far, be making things much worse. The internet-equipped “connected car,” for example, initially introduced by Cadillac in 1996 as a luxury safety feature known as OnStar, has morphed into something else entirely. Increasingly large and complicated dashboard screens take cognitive resources away from the task at hand, which is driving, and have the potential to be as dangerous as texting while driving.

Just as all these interested parties scramble to make cars more technologically complex, they’ve gone all-in on making them bigger, much bigger. Americans are buying — and car manufacturers are producing — more S.U.V.s than ever before, a shift that has led to a 69 percent increase in pedestrian fatalities, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.

Because the front end of an S.U.V. is higher than the average car’s front end, it is far more likely to hit a pedestrian in the chest or head and twice as likely to kill walkers, runners, cyclists and children, compared to regular cars. And yet, S.U.V. sales account for 60 percent of new vehicle sales.

One of the easiest ways to make cars safer would be to make them smaller. Another way? Figuring out how to get people to drive less by providing safer, more sustainable alternatives to the car.

I was hit by a car when a lady had a seizure and ran headlong into me. It’s been over nine years now. I had one cervical spine surgery and need another. I have headaches every day and terrible neurological symptoms. I used public transit for years when I was more able-bodied, and fewer cars isn't the answer when you have disabilities. Erin Gilmer Once as a cyclist in the ’burbs. Once as a pedestrian in Brooklyn. And another time as a cyclist in Brooklyn, I was forced off the road into a parked car Ronald Marans, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times I've been hit by cars twice in San Francisco. Both in the Mission District. Both drivers were making illegal left turns into me. Both drivers were irate that my body impact damaged their car. Jeff Tumlin I was hit while cycling by a left-turning truck driver who said I ""came out of nowhere."" I was airlifted to the hospital and had seven broken bones, five surgeries, spent three months in hospital, one year in a wheelchair. The driver went to jail ... Just kidding, of course he only got a ticket. No real consequences. Lou Savastani, Narberth, PA Mark Makela for The New York Times I got knocked down by a taxi that sped off outside Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakech, Morocco. A lovely rug merchant rushed over, insisted I drink his tonic water for the “quinine.” I said “Shukran! But I don’t think I got malaria.” Yet I was revived and appreciate his kindness. Lila Kerns My 12-year-old son was killed in a crash in front of our home on Oct. 8, 2013. Sammy kissed me goodbye and said, “I love you Mommy.” I never imagined those would be his last words. Sammy was bright, kind, athletic and had a huge heart. We miss him every day. After his death, I joined with others and helped found Families for Safe Streets in N.Y.C. Amy Cohen, New York City Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times

I’m not so naïve to think we can get rid of cars altogether, but we have so many tools to eliminate traffic-related injuries and fatalities right now. Banning all passenger auto-driving vehicles above a certain weight and front grill height would be a great start. Other solutions run the gamut from the quick and easy fixes — like reducing speed limits, eliminating right turns on red, building protected bike lanes and instituting congestion pricing — to major and necessary commitments like funding new transit projects (upgrading, maintaining and expanding existing transit systems) and rethinking land use to encourage walkable development rather than sprawl.

We can all commit to driving less, which reduces both CO2 emissions and the potential for crashes. We need to be as defensive about crosswalks and bike lanes as drivers are about their cars (and where we believe we are entitled to park them).

Until then, the streets will belong to the death machines."

It was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama’s successful playbook in 2008.

During the Q & A following a screening of “Blindspotting” — a movie that engages with police brutality against black people, systemic racial inequalities and gentrification — an older white woman in the audience asked the director if he was “afraid” while they were filming on location in Oakland, Calif. Instantly and jarringly, I was reminded of my other-ness within the room.

At a press screening of Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave” several years ago, I sat through the dramatized depiction of the life of the slave Solomon Northup, in all of its austere, made-for-the-Oscars glory. After sitting through the subjugation of several black characters, especially Lupita Nyong’o’s Patsy, who is raped onscreen by her master and later suffers an excruciatingly unflinching whipping, I was emotionally drained by the weight of the horrors that had been depicted onscreen.

As the mostly white audience trickled out of the theater at the end, I overheard a man expressing relief to his companion: “I couldn’t last 12 minutes of all that, never mind 12 years!”

During the Black Out performance of “Slave Play,” I was shielded from having to endure such gross remarks for a couple of hours. Sure, it was awkward to see Kaneisha twerk to a Rihanna song in Mammy-ish garb for her white husband, who was dressed as a plantation overseer. Watching the researchers conducting the retreat (an interracial lesbian couple) lead the black participants in unpacking their resentment, anger and irritation toward their white partners was discomforting. (It also resurfaced many emotions based on my own past experiences with white romantic partners.) And it was difficult to sit with the play’s final moments, which involve a sexually violent and emotional catharsis.

But that night there seemed to be a fellowship among everyone, as people collectively gasped, provided audible ad-libs (“She’s crazy!” someone exclaimed, referring to the extremely oblivious and frequent interrupter Alana) and erupted into laughter or applause at some of the more outlandish or scabrous moments. If we all interpreted and felt about it differently, it still meant something to have the relief of freedom from judgment to express those responses.

There were fewer of us the second time I saw “Slave Play,” during one of the final preview showings last week. The audience was mostly white, and, unsurprisingly, that sense of community didn’t have quite the same power as it did during the Black Out. The audience was much more muted, though some of the show’s most pivotal moments and biggest comedic beats garnered similarly audible reactions.

It probably helped that I already knew what I was in for, but the experience wasn’t as uncomfortable as I thought it might be. It also doesn’t hurt that Harris’s script is clear in its intentions: The entire point of the therapy, and the reason the black characters desire to role-play antebellum fantasies, is because they want their partners to acknowledge their whiteness and the role racism plays in their every day lives."

This is a political process. And they’re leaning heavily into that idea with the eight-page letter the White House counsel sent tonight. We also see that in the polls: How people view Trump’s actions and the actions of House Democrats is split by party.

We also already know how this story almost certainly ends : Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House’s, calculation is: no.

But isn’t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats’ belief that there’s some kind of cover-up?

Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they’re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided — really late at night — that their position was about something broader.

We also already know how this story almost certainly ends : Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House’s, calculation is: no.

But isn’t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats’ belief that there’s some kind of cover-up?

Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they’re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided — really late at night — that their position was about something broader.

In a moment marked by fractured politics, Ms. Gabbard’s nontraditional positions are a major part of her appeal for voters seeking to break out of polarized partisan divisions. Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, said he planned to vote for her. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, donated to her campaign.

But it’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

Some of those who have worked with Ms. Gabbard say that, as an Iraq war veteran whose chief message is that America should stop trying to police the world, she is representing viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad .

“In reality, Tulsi is really running on an antiwar message that’s consistent with where a lot of veterans are,” said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal veterans organization VoteVets.org, which worked closely with Ms. Gabbard during her first congressional campaign. “I know everyone thinks there’s a conspiracy theory here but that’s really what she’s doing.”

Still, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election and the D.N.C. is well aware of the frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard in the Russian state news media.

An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Ms. Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits, according to data collected by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a group that seeks to track and expose efforts by authoritarian regimes to undermine democratic elections."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

In a moment marked by fractured politics, Ms. Gabbard’s nontraditional positions are a major part of her appeal for voters seeking to break out of polarized partisan divisions. Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, said he planned to vote for her. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, donated to her campaign.

But it’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

Some of those who have worked with Ms. Gabbard say that, as an Iraq war veteran whose chief message is that America should stop trying to police the world, she is representing viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad .

“In reality, Tulsi is really running on an antiwar message that’s consistent with where a lot of veterans are,” said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal veterans organization VoteVets.org, which worked closely with Ms. Gabbard during her first congressional campaign. “I know everyone thinks there’s a conspiracy theory here but that’s really what she’s doing.”

Still, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election and the D.N.C. is well aware of the frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard in the Russian state news media.

An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Ms. Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits, according to data collected by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a group that seeks to track and expose efforts by authoritarian regimes to undermine democratic elections."

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him.

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"
52,Ericka Andersen,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v.

Voters Who Want to Like Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/democrats-debate-republicans.html,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

“The accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely,” the company said in a blog post. “Presently, direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.”"

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

“God bless Kamala,” he said. “But you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight. It’s not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It’s because women are people.”

Later in the debate, the topic of reproductive rights emerged again when Ms. Harris was asked what she would do if states prevailed in further restricting abortion.

On Tuesday night, 12 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage in Ohio for the biggest primary debate in history.

(They also made a quiz on the 2020 campaign so far, if you’re into that.)

Here are the biggest takeaways for those of us watching from the Golden State:

There were two Californians onstage, Senator Kamala Harris and the billionaire Tom Steyer, who lives in San Francisco. How did they do?

This was Mr. Steyer’s first time on a presidential debate stage, and he spent much of his seven minutes and 13 seconds of speaking time introducing himself and his ideas.

Yes, he acknowledged, he is a very rich guy. But as a longtime Democratic donor who has pushed for impeachment for years, he sought to position himself as the best person to expose what he described as the president’s failures.

And asked whether billionaires should be taxed out of existence, he answered yes without hesitation. He also railed against a government that he said has been bought by big corporations."

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

Alex Burns. Hello.

alexander burns

Hello?

michael barbaro

Hey.

alexander burns

Hi.

michael barbaro

Alex, can you hear me?

maggie haberman

Hello?

michael barbaro

Maggie!

maggie haberman

Michael.

michael barbaro

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

[music]

alexander burns

Thanks, Michael.

maggie haberman

Thanks, Michael.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"
64,Ericka Andersen,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v.

Voters Who Want to Like Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/democrats-debate-republicans.html,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

Ms. Warren responded that she wanted to push Mr. Trump “out of the White House,” not just off Twitter. But she did not weigh in on whether the president’s favorite platform should suspend him.

Instead, she turned the discussion back toward antitrust and campaign finance laws, repeating that she had vowed not to take money from many corporate interests.

Here is a transcript of the exchange:

HARRIS: Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump’s account, that you did not agree. And I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. And he and his account should be taken down. We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility.

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey responded by adding that it was also the job of men to fight for women’s reproductive rights.

“God bless Kamala,” he said. “But you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight. It’s not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It’s because women are people.”

Later in the debate, the topic of reproductive rights emerged again when Ms. Harris was asked what she would do if states prevailed in further restricting abortion. Over the past year, Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi have passed bills that effectively prohibit abortions after six to eight weeks of pregnancy."

(If you don’t already get California Today by email, here’s the sign-up.)

On Tuesday night, 12 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage in Ohio for the biggest primary debate in history. My boss — Marc Lacey, The Times’s National editor — helped moderate, and my colleagues covered every minute of the three-hour show extensively. (They also made a quiz on the 2020 campaign so far, if you’re into that.)

Here are the biggest takeaways for those of us watching from the Golden State:

There were two Californians onstage, Senator Kamala Harris and the billionaire Tom Steyer, who lives in San Francisco. How did they do?

This was Mr. Steyer’s first time on a presidential debate stage, and he spent much of his seven minutes and 13 seconds of speaking time introducing himself and his ideas.

Yes, he acknowledged, he is a very rich guy. But as a longtime Democratic donor who has pushed for impeachment for years, he sought to position himself as the best person to expose what he described as the president’s failures.

And asked whether billionaires should be taxed out of existence, he answered yes without hesitation. He also railed against a government that he said has been bought by big corporations."

“Amy Klobuchar is still — she’s eight laps behind and stopped to have lunch, she’s still in the race!” — JIMMY KIMMEL

“And what’s especially difficult is that most of these candidates won’t even become president, so they’re abandoning their families for nothing. That’s got to be a hard talk to have with your kids.

And it’s not just my dream job if Facebook’s newest idea to police itself better goes as planned.

The company calls its latest effort to manage the controversial information on its giant social-media service the Oversight Board. The lofty idea is to create a global group — what some are calling a Supreme Court — by year’s end and make it fully operational by next November. The independent board will judge appeals from users on material that has been taken down from the platform by the company, and it will review policy decisions that the company has submitted to the board.

It’s much needed. It’s hard to miss the rising dissatisfaction and frustration with Facebook. Users, regulators, politicians and the media have had enough with how it has evolved and how the co-creator and chief executive, Mr. Zuckerberg, has been responding to the many problems that seem to pop up daily.

Last week, we saw yet another controversy over the company’s year-old policy to exempt politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to lie in paid advertisements. Senator Elizabeth Warren — the Democratic presidential candidate and Facebook’s No. 1 government critic — gleefully produced a fake ad that appeared on the platform and falsely claimed that Mr. Zuckerberg and his social network support President Trump in the 2020 election."

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

Hello?

Hey.

Hi.

Alex, can you hear me?

Hello?

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

Biden defended his son

“He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.” — Joe Biden

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said multiple times that neither he nor his son Hunter had done anything wrong with regard to Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine, denouncing allegations from President Trump that have led to an impeachment inquiry. Read more here.

And it’s not just my dream job if Facebook’s newest idea to police itself better goes as planned.

The company calls its latest effort to manage the controversial information on its giant social-media service the Oversight Board. The lofty idea is to create a global group — what some are calling a Supreme Court — by year’s end and make it fully operational by next November. The independent board will judge appeals from users on material that has been taken down from the platform by the company, and it will review policy decisions that the company has submitted to the board.

It’s much needed. It’s hard to miss the rising dissatisfaction and frustration with Facebook. Users, regulators, politicians and the media have had enough with how it has evolved and how the co-creator and chief executive, Mr. Zuckerberg, has been responding to the many problems that seem to pop up daily.

Last week, we saw yet another controversy over the company’s year-old policy to exempt politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to lie in paid advertisements. Senator Elizabeth Warren — the Democratic presidential candidate and Facebook’s No. 1 government critic — gleefully produced a fake ad that appeared on the platform and falsely claimed that Mr. Zuckerberg and his social network support President Trump in the 2020 election."

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

She has proposed policies that would make it easier for unions to organize teachers and other workers, and easier for employees to strik… [+1805 chars]",The long-awaited proposal breaks from Obama-era Democratic priorities by critiquing charter schools and testing.,2019-10-21,The New York Times,Warren’s Education Plan Promises Billions for Low-Income Schools and Desegregation,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/us/elizabeth-warren-education-plan.html,"Democrats for Education Reform, a group that supports charters and tougher accountability for teachers and schools, has met with most of the leading candidates. Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

In 2017, synthetic opioids caused more than 28,000 of the 47,600 opioid overdose deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Going after American pharmaceutical executives, Mr. Lehman writes, will do little to reduce the number of overdoses:

Prosecuting bad actors in the pharmaceutical industry is reasonable for correcting past injustices. But we cannot allow it to blind us to where the real problems now lie. … Today drug-enforcement and public-health officials need to spend their energies controlling the border; pushing China and Mexico to crack down on drug cartels; and providing expanded treatment, harm reduction and education.

Bringing opioid companies to court is a moral and strategic necessity

Barry Meier , one of the first journalists to expose the overprescribing of opioids, writes in The Times that court trials, rather than settlements, may be needed to get to the truth. By settling for money, government officials forfeit the ability to gather information that drug companies have fought to keep secret, like when executives knew about the public health crisis they were causing. Mr. Meier writes:

There is little question that settling the current wave of opioid-related lawsuits could bring much-needed addiction treatment to communities nationwide. But in taking the industry’s money quickly, the public will lose its last opportunities to find out about the reckless ways that makers and distributors of opioids acted in pursuit of profit.

Many also believe that pharmaceutical executives should face criminal charges, not just civil ones. “I will tell you as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers,” Senator Kamala Harris said during last week’s Democratic presidential debate when asked if opioid executives should go to prison.

Criminal prosecution, some say, may deter companies from profiting from similar disasters in the future. In Vox, German Lopez notes that the Sacklers, the family behind the OxyContin producer Purdue Pharma, will most likely pay billions of dollars in fines but walk away from the crisis still billionaires.

Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, told Mr. Lopez:

If [the Sacklers] have the perception — and it’s the correct perception — that “people like us just don’t go to jail, we just don’t, so the worst that’s going to happen is you take some reputational stings and you’ll have to write a check,” that seems like a recipe for nurturing criminality. … It would be a powerful deterrent within that group that yes, in fact, no matter how many country clubs you belong to and how many museums you endow, you can still end up behind bars.

The opioid crisis is a symptom of a larger problem

The conservative Times columnist Ross Douthat is one of many observers who have taken a broader view of the opioid epidemic, presenting it as part of the deeper crisis of “deaths of despair” — a term for the rise in deaths from suicide, alcohol and drug abuse since the turn of the century.

In Mr. Douthat’s estimation, the plague of meaninglessness afflicting the country is in all likelihood a product of profound, interlocking social deficiencies that will resist targeted, technocratic cures. He writes:

If we’re going to answer whatever is killing tens of thousands of our countrymen, it’s as important to pay attention to the would-be cultural healers — from the old churches to the New Agers, the online Nietzscheans to the neo-pagans, Jordan Peterson to Marianne Williamson — as it is to have the policy conversations about what’s possible in the next presidential term.

In a similar vein, Anne Case, professor of economics and public affairs emeritus at Princeton, and Angus Deaton, the 2015 Nobel laureate in economics, write in The Washington Post that “opioids are like guns handed out in a suicide ward; they have certainly made the total epidemic much worse, but they are not the cause of the underlying depression.” They add:

We suspect that deaths of despair among those without a university degree are primarily the result of a 40-year stagnation of median real wages and a long-term decline in the number of well-paying jobs for those without a bachelor’s degree. Falling labor force participation, sluggish wage growth, and associated dysfunctional marriage and child-rearing patterns have undermined the meaning of working people’s lives as well.

These are not arguments against litigation per se, but rather a recognition that despair — whether one locates its causes in secularization, as Mr. Douthat is perhaps inclined to, or in economic stagnation, as Ms. Case and Mr. Deaton do, or in something else entirely — is not a problem that society can sue itself out of.

Mr. Trump and his allies had billed the speech, at Benedict College in Columbia, as a chance for the president to step outside the friendly confines of his supporter base and pitch his administration’s record on criminal justice reform and black employment directly to a black audience.

But fewer than 10 students from Benedict were given tickets to the invitation-only event, which had room for about 300 attendees, according to a college spokeswoman. More than half of the seats were reserved for guests and allies of the administration, including many black supporters of Mr. Trump who came from out of state.

“I’m happy he was here,” said Byron Donalds, a black Republican lawmaker in the Florida Legislature who came here for the speech. “People say a lot of things, but I’m about what actually gets done. Some people take issue with him, but I’ve always said, don’t talk about it — be about it. And I’m about what he’s getting done.”

The friendliness of the audience was clear from the moment Mr. Trump took the stage, when someone shouted, “We love you, Mr. President, we love you!” More than once, the audience broke into chants of “four more years,” to which Mr. Trump responded at one point: “Just don’t say 16 more years. You’ll drive them crazy.”

Mr. Trump’s speech opened a three-day event at the college, billed as the “Second Step Presidential Justice Forum.” Leading Democratic presidential candidates will attend the forum on Saturday and Sunday to discuss their criminal justice plans, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

The forum’s name is a reference to the First Step Act, which has helped thousands of federal inmates secure early release under new sentencing guidelines.

Another Democratic candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, said Friday she was pulling out of her scheduled appearance at the forum because its organizers had honored Mr. Trump with their annual Bipartisan Justice Award. She said Mr. Trump had spent decades “celebrating mass incarceration.”"

It’s an endemic problem, and it’s so sad, it’s so dark, and it’s hugely depressing. We have all the same issues that you have in the States, though it’s on a much more extreme scale in the U.S. We have the Black Lives Matter movement here, we have the whole issue with police brutality and police corruption and cases of black people who’ve been taken into detention and end up dead. It seems as though the system is designed in such a way so to protect officers and not to protect civilians. I don’t feel terror when I see the British police here. But, especially in New Orleans, from speaking to a lot of people on our movie set, that’s their experience when they see the police.

I’d like to go way, way back in to “Simon and the Witch,” the 1980s British TV show that marked your first role. Is it right that you did not have to do auditions until later in your career?

I did do auditions, but I got every single role I ever went up for as a kid. I never heard no, which actually set me up quite badly for the adult acting profession. I spent the first year outside of drama school completely unemployed, completely unable to get any work. It was one of most depressing periods of my life.

That “Moonlight” changed everything is wonderful to hear. Do you hear comments on the fact that your biggest role came after you turned 40?

People always ask me, ‘What it’s like, you’re past 40 now?’ This is the best point of my career ever. I’m getting the most interesting roles. So I hope that myth will be laid to rest.

Can we go back to Oscar night in 2017, when “La La Land” was mistakenly named the best picture winner and then “Moonlight” ended up winning. That must’ve been so surreal. Did you expect it to win?"

Once, while living behind a shopping mall, she said a beating by a group of men put her in intensive care for weeks.

Now, Ms. Wallace sleeps on an inflatable mattress under a freeway in the city’s busy tourist district, along with a growing number of other homeless people. She moved to that area after Austin in July became the first major Texas city to allow public camping, in practice allowing people to reside legally on sidewalks and rights of way for the first time.

“There’s safety in numbers,” Ms. Wallace said. “We’re just trying to stay alive out here the best we can.”

The rising visibility of homelessness here is sparking a backlash. Some residents, police and business leaders have complained that people living on sidewalks are leaving trash, frightening other residents walking at night and creating a health hazard.

Some conservative state politicians say Austin is heading down the path of West Coast cities like San Francisco with large, highly visible homeless populations and are threatening to take action. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s office has said that if the city doesn’t show improvement by Nov. 1, the Texas Department of Transportation will begin clearing encampments under the bridges of state-owned roadways.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler, a Democrat, said he didn’t expect so many people to begin camping in public and is open to adjusting the policy, but won’t return to pushing homeless people out of sight.

Mr. Adler, who has met with his counterparts in cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland to gather advice on homelessness, said the city will distinguish itself by focusing on the issue before it worsens. “We were on the path to become Seattle or those other places until we said, ‘No, let’s deal with this,’” he said.

Spats and threats have become commonplace between conservative Texas leaders and the left-leaning leaders of its cities. Austin, which has long prided itself on its progressive politics, has been the biggest target of GOP state politicians who work there.

A point-in-time count last year found 1,014 unsheltered homeless people in Austin and surrounding Travis County, which has a population of about 1.2 million. That number has increased by more than 30% in the past five years. Los Angeles, by contrast has some 37,570 unsheltered homeless in a region of about 10 million people, and San Francisco had 4,353 in a population of 883,305.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What programs and policies do you think are most effective for cities to address homelessness? Join the conversation below.

Mr. Abbott has encouraged Austin residents to tweet photos or videos of homeless people behaving badly and has retweeted those posts on his personal account, including photos of people Twitter users claim accosted them.

In a recent tweet of his own, the governor compared Austin unfavorably with Dallas, which has a larger homeless population. “I spent 3 days in downtown Dallas & saw ZERO homeless laying around or camping on sidewalks. No feces & no used needles,” he wrote. “Austin’s problem isn’t the homeless; it’s lack of leadership.”

Mr. Abbott’s office said it is still considering how to address homelessness in Texas, including where people would be ordered to go if removed from alongside roadways.

Gary Painter, director of the Homelessness Policy Research Institute at the University of Southern California, said policies banning people from sleeping in public simply move the problem around. He attributed high homelessness on the West Coast to population outstripping housing supply, a growing problem in Austin as the number of residents has risen along with its technology-driven economy, driving up housing prices.

David Kruger, whose family jewelry store has been in Austin for 80 years, said people are sleeping in front of his store for the first time he can remember.

“Whether it has affected my business is hard to quantify, but my gut says yes,” he said. “It’s definitely affected people’s perception of downtown.”

After more than six hours of debate, Austin’s city council last week voted to disallow camping on sidewalks and near business doorways, but still permits people to camp on other public rights of way.

Earlier this year, Austin appointed a homeless strategy officer, Lori Pampilo Harris, who immediately helped roll out plans including one to target people in encampments proactively with services.

But Ms. Pampilo Harris left after only a month and said she would instead help the city as a consultant. She called the decision personal and said she remains optimistic that Austin has the right blend of political will and community engagement to tackle the issue.

“There’s a difference between not wanting to see the homeless and ending homelessness,” she said.

Senator Kamala Harris of California led the charge, and was set to boycott the event altogether until the group that had invited Mr. Trump was removed as a sponsor. Other candidates, including Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said the president had a history of racist demagogy that outweighed any recent efforts at criminal justice reform, including the First Step Act , which he signed into law last year.

The First Step Act was a bipartisan bill that helped thousands of federal inmates secure early release under new sentencing guidelines, but Democrats were united in framing it as an insufficient measure. They called for more structural reforms to the criminal justice system, and took aim at Mr. Trump himself, who has made exploitation of racial grievance a trademark of his political brand.

“I find it hypocritical of him to tout whatever advances have been made in the First Step Act given his history,” Ms. Harris said. “The hypocrisy is deafening.” Mr. Biden spoke last, and joked to an audience that had been there for most of the day that they probably felt “incarcerated” themselves. He arrived and left to applause."

His Allies Will Outnumber Students.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/us/politics/trump-benedict-college-hbcu.html,"“Not too much,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his allies had billed the speech, at Benedict College in Columbia, as a chance for the president to step outside the friendly confines of his supporter base and pitch his administration’s record on criminal justice reform and black employment directly to a black audience.

But fewer than 10 students from Benedict were given tickets to the invitation-only event, which had room for about 300 attendees, according to a college spokeswoman. More than half of the seats were reserved for guests and allies of the administration, including many black supporters of Mr. Trump who came from out of state.

“I’m happy he was here,” said Byron Donalds, a black Republican lawmaker in the Florida Legislature who came here for the speech. “People say a lot of things, but I’m about what actually gets done. Some people take issue with him, but I’ve always said, don’t talk about it — be about it. And I’m about what he’s getting done.”

The friendliness of the audience was clear from the moment Mr. Trump took the stage, when someone shouted, “We love you, Mr. President, we love you!” More than once, the audience broke into chants of “four more years,” to which Mr. Trump responded at one point: “Just don’t say 16 more years. You’ll drive them crazy.”

Mr. Trump’s speech opened a three-day event at the college, billed as the “Second Step Presidential Justice Forum.” Leading Democratic presidential candidates will attend the forum on Saturday and Sunday to discuss their criminal justice plans, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

The forum’s name is a reference to the First Step Act, which has helped thousands of federal inmates secure early release under new sentencing guidelines.

Another Democratic candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, said Friday she was pulling out of her scheduled appearance at the forum because its organizers had honored Mr. Trump with their annual Bipartisan Justice Award. She said Mr. Trump had spent decades “celebrating mass incarceration.”"

It’s an endemic problem, and it’s so sad, it’s so dark, and it’s hugely depressing. We have all the same issues that you have in the States, though it’s on a much more extreme scale in the U.S. We have the Black Lives Matter movement here, we have the whole issue with police brutality and police corruption and cases of black people who’ve been taken into detention and end up dead. It seems as though the system is designed in such a way so to protect officers and not to protect civilians. I don’t feel terror when I see the British police here. But, especially in New Orleans, from speaking to a lot of people on our movie set, that’s their experience when they see the police.

I’d like to go way, way back in to “Simon and the Witch,” the 1980s British TV show that marked your first role. Is it right that you did not have to do auditions until later in your career?

I did do auditions, but I got every single role I ever went up for as a kid. I never heard no, which actually set me up quite badly for the adult acting profession. I spent the first year outside of drama school completely unemployed, completely unable to get any work. It was one of most depressing periods of my life.

That “Moonlight” changed everything is wonderful to hear. Do you hear comments on the fact that your biggest role came after you turned 40?

People always ask me, ‘What it’s like, you’re past 40 now?’ This is the best point of my career ever. I’m getting the most interesting roles. So I hope that myth will be laid to rest.

Can we go back to Oscar night in 2017, when “La La Land” was mistakenly named the best picture winner and then “Moonlight” ended up winning. That must’ve been so surreal. Did you expect it to win?"

But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men.

Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders — former Vice President Joseph R.

The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify.

With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it’s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership — not to mention the affected candidates.

What You’ll Find

Upscale, leafy and quiet, the neighborhood’s winding streets feature large single-family homes and little else. There is one small shopping plaza, the Cheviot Hills Shopping Center, with a Vons grocery store, a Rite Aid drugstore, a Starbucks and a few food outlets. The Rancho Park Golf Course and the Hillcrest Country Club form the north and northwest borders of the neighborhood; beneath those green spaces, the neighborhood is triangular, with Manning Avenue forming a border down to the I-10 highway to the west, and Beverwil Drive forming its eastern edge.

The rolling green Rancho Park Golf Course occupies a chunk of the neighborhood’s 1.54 square miles. On the rest, you’ll find a range of architectural styles, including single-level ranch homes dating to the 1950s as well as classic stuccoed Spanish and Tudor revivals.

Development is on the upswing, with a number of homeowners choosing to tear down and build from scratch. The longtime Cheviot Hills home of “Fahrenheit 451” author Ray Bradbury was among those demolished in the past few years when the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Thom Mayne purchased it in 2015 for $1.765 million and built a hyper-modern box of metal and glass in its place. The new home pays tribute to Bradbury with intricately carved metal panels at its front and side entrances featuring quotations by the author.

The most affluent section of Cheviot Hills is Monte Mar Vista, in its northern corner, bordered by the Hillcrest Country Club, Cheviot Hills Park and the Rancho Park Golf Course. Many of the homes there were built in the 1920s and 1930s."

The moves are the most serious reboot from any Democratic campaign that was once in the top tier, but they may not be enough to ensure a turnaround for Ms. Harris. Even as she commits to campaigning aggressively in Iowa, she is keeping up a busy national fund-raising schedule to avoid falling further behind financially; in July, August and September, Ms. Harris spent nearly $1.25 for every dollar she raised.

The restructuring came on the same day that a new poll, from USA Today/Suffolk, showed Ms. Harris dropping to 3 percent, down three percentage points since August. It puts Ms. Harris well behind the leaders and in a virtual tie with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, whom Ms. Harris thought so little of two months ago that she mostly ignored her attacks in the late July debate.

“Campaigns are about tough choices and this one is no different,” Ms. Harris’s communications director, Lily Adams, said on Twitter. “Kamala & this team launched with 1 goal in mind: win the nomination & take on Trump.

This is in large part because substance abuse now affects everyone. The crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s fueled mass incarceration because many white people (who made the laws) saw addicts — largely African-Americans from city neighborhoods — as criminals to be feared. Not any more. “It’s crawling across everybody’s back yard,” Ms. Harris said.

This is what sets criminal justice apart. We can’t demonize the other side, because they are us. Yes, the race and class disparities are still horrendous. But we probably wouldn’t have the First Step Act today had Jared Kushner’s father not served 14 months in federal prison beginning in 2005 for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations.

The Justice Action Network is the advocacy arm of the Coalition for Public Safety, which began in 2015 to gather organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P. on the left, and Right on Crime and Faith and Freedom, on the right.

This is unusual. “Lots of groups are nonpartisan, but that’s not the same as ensuring weight for progressives and conservatives,” said Inimai Chettiar, the legislative and policy director for the Network and the Coalition, both of which are primarily funded by Laura and John Arnold.

The Network forms similar bipartisan coalitions in states, and works with legislators such as Mr. Harris and Ms. Delozier. It began in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, and next year will work in 20 states. At the federal level, the Network’s advocacy was crucial to expanding the First Step Act to include sentencing reform.

The Network will only pursue a reform if its motley group of members unanimously agree. Those issues don’t include policing, guns or the death penalty — issues on which partisan divides are strong. The Network does work on reforming pretrial detention, sentencing, probation and parole, civil asset forfeiture laws, and the fines and fees charged to defendants and inmates. It also works to establish alternatives to incarceration, more humane treatment for women in prison, and a path after prison to a successful, law-abiding life."

The issue is a talking point among Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) has called for a nationwide ban on police use of facial recognition. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) have both called for regulations on facial-recognition technology as part of their criminal-justice platforms.

Also worrying for corporations is a bill that Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) introduced in March. The Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act would limit companies’ ability to share facial-recognition data and would prohibit the use of the technology unless a business obtains consent from the people it is used on and provides notice and documentation explaining how the technology works. The bill hasn’t made it to a committee vote.

Nine industry groups—including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Security Industry Association and the American Association of Airport Executives—sent a letter dated Oct. 16 to more than a dozen House and Senate lawmakers urging them not to support strict limits on the use of facial-recognition technology.

“[W]e are concerned that a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology would be premature and have unintended consequences not only for innovation, safety, and security but for the continued improvement of the technology’s accuracy and effectiveness,” the letter said.

Retailers, airports, stadiums and other businesses have already started rolling out facial-recognition tools to improve security and speed up customer check-ins.

“We’re not opposed to regulation, but we oppose a ban,” said Tim Day, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce’s Technology Engagement Center. “There should be guardrails in place to allow the technology to move forward in a smart way.”

The Chamber has convened a facial-recognition working group of about 40 companies from sectors including retail and transportation. The group plans to release model legislation for facial recognition by year-end and to lobby lawmakers to draft and vote for laws that are in line with those guidelines, Mr. Day said.

San Francisco; Oakland, Calif.; and Somerville, Mass., have passed laws banning government agencies from using the technology.

California has prohibited facial-recognition software in police body cameras: Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the bill into law this month. The legislation, which becomes effective in January and expires after three years, doesn’t apply to the private sector.

Some companies, meanwhile, are pointing to the benefits that facial recognition brings.

Miami International Airport, which is affiliated with Airports Council International—North America, has cut passenger screening wait times by up to 80% over the past year, thanks in part to a biometrics-only concourse screening facility, according to a Miami-Dade Aviation Department spokesman.

In January, the airport started using the technology for entry screening on up to 10 international flights a day, and it is testing facial recognition for boarding on “a few daily flights,” the spokesman said. The plan is to eventually expand both programs airport-wide.

Such programs would be hampered if facial recognition bans were passed, Mr. Day said.

In Europe, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, which prohibits companies from processing facial-recognition data unless certain circumstances apply, have slowed and in some cases halted the rollout of the technology, said Heikki Koski, chief digital officer at Finavia, the state-owned operator of 21 Finnish airports.

Helsinki Airport is undergoing a €1 billion ($1.11 billion) expansion set to be completed in 2022, and it is considering using facial recognition in new check-in and security facilities, Mr. Koski said. But aviation officials haven’t decided whether to proceed because of the challenges of complying with strict data-privacy laws.

Under the GDPR, organizations can be fined up to €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue, whichever is larger. In August, the Swedish Data Protection Authority fined a municipality about €20,000 for conducting a facial-recognition pilot to keep track of students’ school attendance.

The Swedish authority found that the pilot violated the GDPR. The school failed to perform an adequate impact assessment and consult with Swedish privacy authorities before processing biometric data, it said. Consent from the students wasn’t valid, it added, because of the “clear imbalance” between the students and the school.

“There are many obstacles to solve before we will see widespread implementation here,” Mr. Koski said.

Before moving in, they tore down several walls, eliminating one bath and combining two upstairs bedrooms into one larger one with a huge walk-in closet — what Mr. Shapiro calls “the princess suite” — for Elysa.

What You’ll Find

Upscale, leafy and quiet, the neighborhood’s winding streets feature large single-family homes and little else. There is one small shopping plaza, the Cheviot Hills Shopping Center, with a Vons grocery store, a Rite Aid drugstore, a Starbucks and a few food outlets. The Rancho Park Golf Course and the Hillcrest Country Club form the north and northwest borders of the neighborhood; beneath those green spaces, the neighborhood is triangular, with Manning Avenue forming a border down to the I-10 highway to the west, and Beverwil Drive forming its eastern edge.

The rolling green Rancho Park Golf Course occupies a chunk of the neighborhood’s 1.54 square miles. On the rest, you’ll find a range of architectural styles, including single-level ranch homes dating to the 1950s as well as classic stuccoed Spanish and Tudor revivals.

Development is on the upswing, with a number of homeowners choosing to tear down and build from scratch. The longtime Cheviot Hills home of “Fahrenheit 451” author Ray Bradbury was among those demolished in the past few years when the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Thom Mayne purchased it in 2015 for $1.765 million and built a hyper-modern box of metal and glass in its place. The new home pays tribute to Bradbury with intricately carved metal panels at its front and side entrances featuring quotations by the author.

The most affluent section of Cheviot Hills is Monte Mar Vista, in its northern corner, bordered by the Hillcrest Country Club, Cheviot Hills Park and the Rancho Park Golf Course. Many of the homes there were built in the 1920s and 1930s."
