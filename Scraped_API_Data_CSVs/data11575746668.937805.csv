She’s run a substantive campaign, and the press loves her gotta-plan-for-everything approach almost as much as her steady rise in the polls.

Joe Biden? The left can’t stand him. The Nation just ran an “anti-endorsement” urging Biden to drop out, saying he’d been “picking up where the Obama administration left off: a restoration of business as usual for the K Street lobbyists and Wall Street speculators.”

MEDIA TRUMPET KENTUCKY VOTE AS TRUMP FAVORITE FACES DEFEAT

But Warren would be the scourge of the big bankers, checks all the progressive boxes and isn’t a white male to boot. No wonder Bill Gates is openly worrying that she’ll soak him for $100 billion.

Sure, the Massachusetts senator is starting to get a tad more scrutiny since she unveiled a $20-trillion plan to pay for Medicare for All, after months of finessing journalists’ questions on the issue. And there was an “SNL” skit with Kate McKinnon portraying her as a know-it-all playing with funny money—not exactly Alec Baldwin territory.

But these have been dwarfed by glowing profiles of her time in Oklahoma, or at Harvard, or even as a bankruptcy lawyer, and how she developed into a fierce consumer advocate.

So why is a founding editor of Politico suggesting the press is giving her short shrift?

The argument John Harris makes in his new column is that reporters talk to downbeat Democrats who are chattering about Warren and “her embrace of mandatory ‘Medicare for All.’ By these lights: The plan is wildly expensive, unrealistic, frightening to moderate voters in key swing states who want to dump Trump but need reassurance before empowering a liberal in the Oval Office.”

After all, how much of an albatross would it be in a fall campaign when more voters learn that Warren would kick 150 million Americans off private insurance in favor of a massive government-run program?

Harris, a former Washington Post reporter, concludes that “the more pervasive force shaping coverage of Washington and elections is what might be thought of as centrist bias, flowing from reporters and sources alike. It is a headwind for Warren, Sanders, the ‘squad’ on Capitol Hill, even for Trump. This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”

Harris admits to this bias, and then challenges himself to provide the other side.

Warren, he writes, “is ready to divide the county and her party over the proposition that a much more aggressive role for government is needed to bring business to heel and protect individuals and the global climate from the predations of a free market…Fundamental societal change comes from people burning with grievances, obsessed with remedies, ready to demolish old power arrangements to achieve their ends.”

In other words, it’s risky and aggressive candidates who wind up changing society, such as Trump in 2016, not the wise and seasoned incrementalists. In fact, it’s the media establishment and Beltway mandarins that have brought us such debacles as the Iraq war and 2008 financial meltdown.

Well, maybe. But first you’ve gotta get elected. And Democrats have to decide whether Warren represents their best shot.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post takes some relatively mild criticism of Warren from Biden and Pete Buttigieg to ask whether they are getting into “one of the most fraught areas for a female candidate: Is she likable?”

Buttigieg criticized Warren’s “my way or the highway approach” and said she is “so absorbed in the fighting that it is as though fighting were the purpose.” Biden said she reflects “an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.”

These are garden-variety jabs in politics. They’re not saying she’s personally angry. They’re saying she’s a rigid ideologue who doesn’t like compromise—just what you’d expect from rivals occupying the moderate lane.

If even policy-based criticism of Elizabeth Warren is ruled suspect, she’ll sail to the nomination, despite the misgivings of the media and political establishment."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made a deportation moratorium part of his immigration plan.

The response from Senator Warren, D-Mass., came after a question at a town hall in North Carolina. A woman, who spoke in Spanish, told Warren about her husband, who she says was arrested for drug possession, served his sentence and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She asked if any moratorium would include those with criminal records.

SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL

“So I am open to suspending deportations, particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform,” Warren responded. “I believe that what we’re doing right now, with ICE focusing on people who do not pose a threat -- that when ICE comes into our communities, takes our neighbors, our friends, our family members -- that they do not make this country safer.”

Warren said she wants ICE to focus on things like fighting terrorism and tackling the import of drugs such as fentanyl. She also said she opposes the Trump administration’s view, which she summarized as ""anyone who has violated any law means they can’t even be considered to stay.”

She did not say if that moratorium would include any exceptions for those with convictions for violent or other serious crimes.

Warren’s push for a deportation moratorium comes a day after Sanders issued his own sweeping immigration plan, one that would impose a moratorium on deportations, ""break up"" existing immigration enforcement agencies, grant full welfare access to illegals and welcome a minimum of 50,000 “climate migrants” in the first year of a Sanders administration.

According to the plan, President Sanders would stop deportations until there was a full audit of ""current and past practices and policies."" He would also break up Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Matters to do with deportation and enforcement would return to the Department of Justice, customs matters to the Treasury and naturalization and citizenship to the State Department.

Warren was asked if she would break up those agencies, but said only that they need to be “reorganized within the system” and reformed.

WARREN $52T 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN REVEALED: CAMPAIGN STILL CLAIMS NO MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES NEEDED

“ICE and CBP need to be completely reformed. They should not be spending their resources on things that don't pose a threat to the United States, they should not be spending their resources on scooping up neighbors and friends who pose no real threat,” she told reporters. ""They need to be spending their resources on container shipping, on contraband that comes into this country, on terrorists. Not on people who are here with their families, and trying to live peacefully and make a living among us.”

Sanders' plan also opens up all welfare and government services to include illegal immigrants, promising that his “Medicare-for-all” and “College-for-all” plans would both be available regardless of immigration status.

Warren, who announced her $52 trillion “Medicare-for-all” plan last week, reiterated that that plan would include illegal immigrants.

“Medicare-for-all, as I've put together, covers everyone regardless of immigration status and that's it,” she said.

In particular, she said it would make a lot more sense once those illegal immigrants are on a ""pathway to citizenship"" she has as part of her plan to legalize those in the country illegally.

""If you're on a path to citizenship, we just fixed a big part of deportation, right?"" she said. ""Why wouldn't we want you to have healthcare?""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called the level of income and wealth inequality in the United States ""grotesque."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., frequently calls for a leveling of the economic playing field and rails against a U.S. economy that is, ""doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.""

As a solution to this apparent unfairness, Sanders and Warren, two of the top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, have proposed significant new taxes that they say target the wealthy and large corporations. On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Wall Street Journal columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady and a panel of experts took on ""income inequality"" in America and debated whether or not it justifies the Democrats' proposals.

""[Income inequality] measures don't actually tell you the information you want to know about whether a country is a just country,"" said Ian Vasquez, who is the director of the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity.

""The United States by standard inequality measures is just as unequal as the Congo,"" he continued. ""Yet the United States ranks among the best countries in the United Nations' human development indicators. It has the rule of law. It's got a government that works relatively well. There are freedoms here and opportunities here and we're much, much more prosperous. That's not at all the case in Congo.""

In fact, as the Cato Institute notes, the common measurement used to determine income inequality indicates that the U.S., Sweden, and Denmark have similar levels of inequality. But despite that,self-described ""Democratic-socialist"" Sanders has hailed Sweden and Denmark as a model for the U.S.

Phil Magness, a senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, argued that measurements of Americans' ability to improve their economic circumstances are far better indicators of economic fairness in society than is income inequality.

""The mobility issue is the key statistic that we'd have to look to here,"" he said. ""The Census just released a big study a couple of weeks ago that showed that, yes, the middle class was getting smaller, but it was only getting smaller because people were moving from the middle class into the upper class over time.""

""You think about who are the richest billionaires in America. It's Mark Zuckerberg, who created a company out of his dorm room at Harvard,"" said Magness. ""It's Bill Gates, who created a company basically out of his garage. These are people that are self-made. They started out in a much lower quintile than, you know, a robber baron of the past who inherited his wealth.""

O'Grady asked why Warren and others are harping on the income inequality narrative if it is not a practical measurement.

VARNEY: MEDIA 'PANIC' OVER ELIZABETH WARREN'S 'MAJOR GAFFE THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK'

""The narrative of inequality can be used as a political tool,"" said Roberto Salinas-Leon, who is the director of the Center for Latin America at Atlas Network. ""Basically what you're doing there is you're inflaming rage and you're using visceral narratives rather than constructive narratives or reasoned discourse to try and solve our problems.""

In addition, Magness argued that Sanders and Warren are attempting to hide their true intentions from voters, because their big-government proposals would dramatically raise taxes, as former Obama administration treasury adviser Steven Rattner recently noted in the New York Times.

""Taxes are unpopular. Politicians have not had success historically running on, 'I'm going to raise taxes.' They do try to change the narrative here,"" Magness said. ""This is why inequality becomes kind of this catch-all phrase for a whole litany of other programs.""

""Because someone else is going to be taxed not me, right?"" offered O'Grady.

""Exactly,"" agreed Magness. ""I think the way that they're trying to play it out politically is using the inequality mantra as this catch-all phrase for just a standard litany of traditional progressive left-leaning policies that have failed in the past.""

48% PAYROLL TAX NEEDED TO FUND WARREN'S BIG GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS: TAX EXPERT

""It almost seems like they're these Democratic politicians are marketing a free lunch... As we know, there is no such thing,"" said O'Grady.

""What's ironic about some of these programs, especially the social spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and so on, is that while they reduce income inequality, they apparently, according to a number of studies, increase wealth inequality,"" noted Vasquez. ""Because people have a disincentive... to save. They can count on these government programs unlike the rich and they're also taxed... so it reduces the savings and assets of most people, except the rich.""

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are locked in a race to the left that could leave either struggling to attract the center in a general election, and former Vice President Joe Biden is facing lingering doubts about his campaign's strength.

The billionaire Bloomberg, despite previously ruling out a run, is expected to file paperwork this week designating himself as a candidate in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary. In a statement, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said bluntly that Bloomberg was worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls is not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

BLOOMBERG EXPECTED TO FILE PAPERWORK TO ENTER 2020 ALABAMA DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

That’s a view shared by a number of Democratic strategists and commentators. While Biden remains near the top of the polls, questions about his age, fitness and fundraising ability have shadowed him, and he has been savaged by the party’s left-flank for his more moderate positions on questions such as health care, immigration and even working with Republicans.

“This is a thunderclap,” Obama strategist David Axelrod tweeted about the Bloomberg news. “And not exactly a vote of confidence from leading moderate in durability of @JoeBiden campaign.”

Trump, meanwhile, predicted that Bloomberg would hurt Biden, and indicated he looked forward to the prospect of a Bloomberg candidacy.

“There’s no one I would rather run against than Little Michael,” Trump told reporters, while also casting doubt on Bloomberg's ability to prevail in the primaries.

It remains unclear whether Bloomberg, running from the center-left, could command the kind of primary support necessary to rise in the packed field, even spending his own fortune to do it.

One possibility, as Trump suggested, is that he'd draw just enough support from Biden to boost a more liberal candidate such as Warren, D-Mass., or Sanders. I-Vt. -- whose big-spending policy prescriptions have also raised alarm about general election viability.

“There’s more anxiety than ever,” Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, told The New York Times last month. Brown has also been eyed by some Democrats as a possible late entrant to the race.

“We’re both getting the calls. I’ve been surprised by some who’ve called me,” Schultz said.

Last Friday, Warren released her “Medicare-for-all” plan, coming with an eyewatering price tag of $52 trillion (including $20 trillion in new spending over the next decade) and a promise not to raise taxes on the middle class -- a claim met with deep skepticism from across the political spectrum. But centrists were also scathing about how the plan would play out in swing states.

“This is going to cause down-ballot damage in swing districts and states if she’s the nominee,” Colorado State Rep. Bri Buentello told Politico.

Sanders, meanwhile, on Thursday released his immigration plan -- a grab bag of far-left items including a deportation freeze, full welfare access for illegal immigrants, the dismantling of federal immigration agencies, and the promise to accept a minimum of 50,000 “climate migrants” in the first year of a Sanders administration.

While those plans have been cheered by left-wing activists, it is far from clear how well they would go down in swing states any Democrat needs to win in order to beat Trump.

While current national polling suggests most of the main 2020 candidates would beat Trump next year, there are warning signs in the polling data for Democrats -- apart from the general caveat that most polling also showed Trump losing in 2016, and he didn’t.

The swing states generally show a tighter race against Trump. A New York Times/Siena College survey in six battleground states released Friday shows that Democrats there also prefer a more moderate pick. A majority, 55 percent, said they wanted a candidate more moderate than most Democrats, and 62 percent wanted a candidate who would try and find common ground with Republicans.

“With Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,” Axelrod told the Times last month.

The idea that Bloomberg’s entrance into the 2020 race is a response to the deficiencies of the current field has been greeted by glee by Republicans.

“Really? Another one?"" Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest tweeted. “The fact that Michael Bloomberg feels the need to run for president underscores the weak Democrat field and shows that Democrats know they can’t compete with @realDonaldTrump in 2020.”

There are other signs that Democrats on the sidelines are nervous about the current field. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of a series of rumors that she may throw her hat in the race -- a prospect that seemed unthinkable a year ago. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that former Attorney General Eric Holder is considering stepping into the race too.

The consideration of any of these politicians may reflect sheer personal ambition as much as concern about the field -- but the fact they're even flirting with a run at this late stage indicates they see an opening for that reason.

It remains to be seen whether Bloomberg will jump all the way in. The next major deadline he faces is in New Hampshire, where the deadline for candidates to put their name on the ballot is Nov. 11. Bloomberg aides tell Fox News there’s no word yet on whether the former New York City mayor will come to New Hampshire to file. But they add that they'll do ""everything necessary to keep all of our options open.”

Team Bloomberg is also reaching out to top Granite State Democrats. Longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley told Fox News that he’s been contacted. But others have pushed back on the idea that what Democratic voters want is even more candidates to choose from.

Longtime New Hampshire based Democratic consultant James Demers – who’s backing Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey this cycle – said that “anybody and everybody has a right to run if they want to but I’m hearing voters more and more saying ‘I really want this field to winnow down to six or seven so I can process who’s running and they’re not asking for the field to grow.’

“So I think it’s a high-stakes game for anyone to get in this late in the game because that’s not where the voters’ heads are,” he said.

And the former vice president dismissed suggestions that a likely candidacy by the billionaire business mogul and former New York City mayor is a reflection of his own performance as he runs for the White House.

Biden was in New Hampshire on Friday to file to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. His appearance came the morning after news that Bloomberg filed his paperwork on Friday – ahead of a deadline – to designate himself as a candidate in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary.

BLOOMBERG MOVE UNDERSCORES DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONCERN OVER CURRENT 2020 FIELD

Bloomberg -- a former independent who registered last year as a Democrat -- flirted with a presidential bid early this year but in March ruled out a run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well-positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

“I welcome him in the race. Michael's a solid guy and let's see where it goes. I have no problem with him getting in the race,” the former vice president told reporters.

Biden shot down talk that Bloomberg is likely to launch a Democratic nomination bid because Biden’s own campaign is struggling. Some recent polls have suggested the frontrunner is losing ground to rivals like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

“In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead,” he emphasized.

And Biden took a shot at reporters, saying, “I know you guys like this fiction about how things have closed down and everything's moving.”

Asked by Fox News if he’s talked with Bloomberg in recent days, the former vice president appeared to confirm the two have had a recent conversation, saying “I've spoken with Michael a lot.”

But he refused to elaborate, saying “it would be inappropriate of me to tell you about any conversations I had or didn't have with him about whether or not he was going to run.”

If Bloomberg launches a campaign, he could quickly spend millions on his own behalf. Biden – who’s long pushed for publicly funded elections and who’s struggled with his fundraising compared to some of his top 2020 rivals – didn’t directly answer when asked if he was concerned.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Instead, Biden praised Bloomberg’s contributions to the efforts to curb gun violence and to combat climate change.

Calling him an “honorable guy,” Biden said, “Michael Bloomberg has put a lot of money behind things that causes I care a lot about from dealing with keeping guns off the street and assault weapons, et cetera. He's done a lot for dealing with a whole range of issues.”

The conventional wisdom is Bloomberg – who like Biden is considered more moderate than others in the race - could take votes away from Biden. But longtime New Hampshire Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, a top Granite State Biden supporter, dismissed such concerns.

“Our guy is solid at this point in time,” the state senator stressed.

He said that Democrats in the state weren’t clamoring for another candidate to enter the race, noting they “are very satisfied with the current field of candidates.”

Biden -- accompanied by former four-term Democratic Gov. John Lynch -- passed through a cauldron of supporters packed into the halls of the historic New Hampshire Statehouse as he arrived to file. And after he filed, he headlined a rally with supporters.

While Biden remains at the fore in national polling, he’s slightly behind top-tier rivals Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts in the latest New Hampshire survey. The two progressive standard-bearers hail from states seen as New Hampshire neighbors.

Biden emphasized that “it's really important that you do well in the first four states. It could be enough to make you a nominee. It could be enough to keep you in the race. It could be enough to take you out of the race.”

And he stressed that “I plan on trying to win New Hampshire. I'm not here to come in second. I never entered anything to come in second.”

A couple of hours before Biden’s appearance, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang filed to place his name on the primary ballot.

While complimenting Bloomberg, Yang predicted that “I do think that he’s going to have an uphill climb in the race, in part because of New Hampshire, where the people here in New Hampshire love to meet a candidate in person, take their temperature, look into their eyes, sometimes have them in their living room. I don’t think that’s going to be possible with Mike.”

And Yang – who’s campaigned extensively in the state over the past year and a half – emphasized that “there are some things money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible. I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him”

New Hampshire is the next major deadline Bloomberg faces. The deadline for candidates to file to place their name on the first-in-the nation presidential primary is next Friday, November 11.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News that there’s no word yet on whether the former New York City mayor will come to New Hampshire to file. But they added that they'll do ""everything necessary to keep all of our options open.”

But Bloomberg’s reached out to some top Granite State Democrats. Longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley told Fox News that he received a call from Bloomberg."

The recent announcement of a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis represents but the latest example of American innovation delivering for patients — innovation that a government-run health care system could destroy.

As the mother of a 5-year-old daughter with cystic fibrosis, I recognize the very real challenges she and the other 30,000 Americans with cystic fibrosis face every day: The daily breathing treatments and chest physical therapy to maintain lung function, the numerous oral and inhaled medications, the constant fear of developing respiratory infections, and the grim future of a life expectancy that averages just 44 years.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS, DOCTORS CELEBRATE FDA'S 'LIFE-CHANGING' APPROVAL OF NEW TREATMENT

Trikafta, the new treatment recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, targets the genes that cause cystic fibrosis patients to build up mucus in their lungs and organs.

For the 90 percent of cystic fibrosis patients with genes that respond to Trikafta – many of whom previously lacked access to effective therapies – this drug could turn cystic fibrosis into a more readily managed chronic disease.

As a result, many cystic fibrosis patients could now have the promise of an average life expectancy, if not a completely normal life.

As thrilling as Trikafta sounds for my daughter, I worry about whether patients like her would have access to this drug under Democratic proposals for a single-payer health care system.

For instance, Britain’s single-payer system spent the past four years denying patients access to another cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi. While American patients have accessed Orkambi since 2015, only in the past month did the National Health Service finally allow 5,000 cystic fibrosis British patients to access a drug the government had previously dubbed “unaffordable.”

When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., finally released details of her single-payer health care plan, a prominent name appeared on the document: Donald Berwick.

Berwick, whom even a Democratic-run Senate would not confirm to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, spent much of his career defending the kind of rationing systems that the British National Health Service used for years to deny cystic fibrosis patients access to Orkambi.

In fact, Berwick, who won a knighthood for his work in Britain’s government-run health system, said that ""the decision is not whether or not we will ration care – the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.""

A statement like Berwick’s is frightening and should scare anyone who knows someone with a costly disease.

Trikafta took three decades to develop. Scientists first isolated the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis in 1989. Vertex, which developed the treatment, has set a high price tag for Trikafta, at $311,000. But a treatment that can extend life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients by decades, while also improving the quality of life for my daughter and patients like her, is still worthwhile even at that price.

A government-run health care system could block Americans’ access to treatments like Trikafta – or, worse yet, stifle medical innovation altogether, and discourage companies from creating breakthroughs in the first place.

""We have a fractured American family,"" Sheindlin began, adding she believed that while there are people like Maher who despise President Trump, there are also others who ""adore"" the president. She went on to blast lawmakers on Capitol Hill for their lack of legislating.

""The parties have become so angry with each other that nothing is happening,"" Sheindlin, a 77-year-old retired family court judge, whose popular TV show has been airing for nearly 25 years, observed. ""The American public is paying for a very expensive system -- an executive, a judicial branch of government, and Congress -- and we're not getting anything done.

""I don't see a big-city Jew exciting the vote in Alabama or a lot of the country,"" Maher elaborated. ""The election is going to be decided in six states and they're not named New York. ... We're talking about Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Florida.""

… [+2578 chars]",Michael Bloomberg’s top political adviser announced late Friday that the former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul won’t campaign in the early voting presidential primary and caucus states if he enters the 2020 Democratic race for president.,2019-11-08,Fox News,"Bloomberg won’t campaign in early voting states if he runs for president, aide says",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-wont-campaign-in-early-voting-states-if-he-runs-for-president-aide-says,"Michael Bloomberg’s top political adviser announced late Friday that the former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul won’t campaign in the early voting presidential primary and caucus states if he enters the 2020 Democratic race for president.

""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing. But the late timing of our entry means that many candidates already have a big head start in the four early states, where they've spent months and months campaigning and spending money,” Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said in a statement.

BIDEN ON BLOOMBERG: 'I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HIM GETTING IN THE RACE'

“We have enormous respect for the Democratic primary process and many friends in those states, but our plan is to run a broad-based, national campaign,” he added.

Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina are the first four states to kick off the presidential nominating calendar. They are scheduled to hold their caucuses and primaries in February of next year, ahead of the rest of the country.

Top-tier candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have built up strong organizations – with plenty of boots on the ground - in the early voting states.

Bloomberg flirted with a presidential bid early this year – including a swing through New Hampshire - but in March ruled out a 2020 White House run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

On Friday, Bloomberg aides filed paperwork in Alabama to designate him as a candidate in that state’s Democratic presidential primary just ahead of the deadline.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News the next primary ballot deadline he faces as he takes concrete steps towards launching a White House bid is Tuesday in Arkansas

But it's all but certain Bloomberg won’t travel to New Hampshire before the November 15 deadline for candidates to place their name on the ballot in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Minutes after Bloomberg’s announcement, New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley responded.

“We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn't run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states,” Buckley wrote.

“New Hampshire and other early state voters are some of the most engaged voters in the country,"" the longtime state party chair added. ""They ask tough questions that prepare the candidates for what's to come in the general election. It's unfortunate that Michael Bloomberg doesn't want to participate in this invaluable, important, and unique primary process and be tested the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.""

And Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price tweeted that ""it's disappointing to hear that Mayor Bloomberg doesn’t plan on competing in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses or the other three early nominating states.""

Retail campaigning is a crucial compenent of campaign politics in Iowa and New Hampshire, with some voters in both states often meeting and asking qusetions of the candidates multiple times during the course of a presidential primary cycle.

If Bloomberg follows through and officially enters the race, he's expected to spend millions of his own money on his White House bid, lauching TV and digital ads from coast to coast as he likely runs a national campaign.

But Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang, who's campaigned extensively in Iowa and New Hampshire over the past year and a half, predicted that Bloomberg is ""going to have a uphill climb in the race.""

Speaking to reporters after he filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot - hours before Bloomberg's announced decision to skip the early voting states - Yang said “there are somethings money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible.""

""I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him,"" Yang added."

In an interview with PBS News Hour on Friday, Biden said that although he would not reverse President Trump's decision to move the embassy at this point, he said: ""I wouldn't have done it in the first place.""

A person close to Biden's campaign told Fox News on Thursday that Biden's comments are ""not out of synch with the position that he's had"" but rather are a criticism of the way Trump handled the decision, which drew the ire of Palestinians who also stake claim to the land.

BIDEN DROPS TO FOURTH AMONG IOWA DEMOCRATS, NEW POLL SHOWS

""His objection was not to the move but to the way it was done. It should have been made in the context of a larger deal that achieved important concessions for the peace process,"" the source told Fox News.

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden said in a statement to Axios that ""Vice President Biden would not move the American embassy back to Tel Aviv, but he would re-open our consulate in East Jerusalem to engage the Palestinians.""

In 2018, Trump made good on a main campaign promise to appease his conservative and evangelical base by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the embassy to the city.

Biden backed numerous pieces of legislation passed by the Senate during his tenure as a representative from Deleware that supported both moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel-- a law that was waived by Trump's predecessors.

“Joe Biden spent literally decades promising to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, only to fail when he had eight years as vice president to do it. President Trump made a similar promise, but unlike Joe Biden, he actually stuck to his word and got it done,” Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement to Fox News on Thursday.

During former President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, Biden said ""it's been my position for years,"" to have Jerusalem recognized as the undivided capital city of Israel.

""Jerusalem must be the capital of Israel. Whatever decision the Israelis make, that's a decision we'll support,” Biden said at the time.

“I think we should move the embassy, but you don't have a [Israeli] government asking us to move the embassy there. Let them make the judgment,” he added.

Biden's flip flop on the issue marks yet another attempt by the candidate to align himself with left-leaning voters by reversing his previously held stances, which has drawn the ire of other Democratic contenders vying for the nomination.

Biden, who has remained in the lead according to most national polls but is neck and neck with two other candidates-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.-- came under fire for changing his decades-long position on the Hyde Amendment in June.

His 2020 Democratic rivals criticized Biden's previous support as a senator for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to subsidize abortions except for cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is endangered -- a notion some of his campaign rivals fear has a disproportionate impact on minority communities.

Biden reversed his stance on the controversial piece of legislation at a campaign rally, saying he ""can no longer support an amendment that makes"" a woman's right to an abortion ""dependent on someone's ZIP code.""

HIPSTERS, HENRY, HOGS AND HOW TO LOSE AN ELECTION

As the weather turns nippy here in our nation’s capital we cannot resist thinking of Bob Hope’s great old line: “It’s so cold in Washington that the politicians actually have their hands in their own pockets.” In order to keep the blood pumping, what do you say to a serving of news nuggets?



- Oh, Michael Bloomberg. The former New York mayor and multi-billionaire is a national political figure in the same way that Brooklyn hipsters are leading a national cultural trend. It seems true if you live in the media universe of the NYT, “Morning Joe” and Vanity Fair think pieces. In what is at least his third flirtation with a presidential run in this cycle alone, Bloomberg is using his wealth to start to secure ballot access for next year’s primaries… Just in case. This was met with huge response across the media spectrum. But our default position remains, “So what?” We’d imagine that Bloomberg would open up in something like sixth place if he did declare. And as Tom Steyer has shown a willingness to burn bales of money hardly guarantees forward momentum. The consultants who have bought second homes stoking Bloomberg’s presidential fantasies are likely the only ones to benefit from this, ahem, bloomlet.



- But what if he really does jump in? If Bloomberg gets any kind of traction the obvious beneficiary is Elizabeth Warren. The bellyaching from old-guard Democrats like David Axelrod about front-runner Joe Biden has helped draw Bloomberg closer to the race. But what do these mandarins think would happen if Bloomberg really got in? He wouldn’t be drawing votes from Warren, that’s for sure. His only path forward would be to cut Biden off at the knees, further splitting the moderate vote. There are no perfect candidates, that’s a fact the Democratic donor class had better figure out if they’re really serious about winning in 2020.



- One of the strategies Republicans are reportedly weighing to deflect criticism of President Trump’s Ukrainian fiasco is to scapegoat three Trump insiders: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Rudy Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. The idea would be to say that three had gone rogue and exceeded the president’s desires. Mulvaney, as it turned out, was quite right in the Oct. 17 press conference that was denounced and derided. His stated position – that Trump had leaned on his Ukrainian counterpart about Joe Biden, that aid to the country was conditioned on cooperation, that politics are part of foreign policy and that everybody needed to “get over it” – has become the de facto position of the GOP and administration. It makes sense to torch Giuliani, who has only been bad news for Trump. Sondland is already acting as a free agent. But it seems more than a little dangerous to try to punish the chief of staff just now.



- As Michael Kinsley long ago taught us about Washington: “The scandal isn't what's illegal, the scandal is what's legal.” A great piece in the WSJ today from reporters Thomas Grove and Alan Cullison illustrates one of the slimiest realities of life in Washington. There’s been a great deal of focus on how Hunter Biden cashed in on his father’s influence with wealthy foreigners seeking favorable treatment from the U.S. government. But like many others, Burisma, the Ukrainian firm at the center of the scandal, pumped big money into official Washington through multiple channels. The slop bucket sloshes on think tanks, lobbyists, message mavens and other influence peddlers. It’s all perfectly legal and perfectly putrid. But from Beijing to Riyadh to Moscow to Mexico City, rich and powerful folks know that the hogs will line up at the trough in Washington every time. Oink, oink.



- We were dubious about the near-universal predictions that Jeff Sessions’ effort to reclaim his Alabama Senate seat would run into a buzz saw of opposition from his erstwhile tormenter, President Trump. Sessions’ rivals were quick to blast him for alleged disloyalty to Trump and most coverage focused on how Trump would play in the primary. But given his first opportunity to lace into Sessions in today’s installment of “Chopper Talk” Trump gave Sessions a pass and even praised his former attorney general for – what else – saying nice things about him. It makes perfect sense to us. Sessions endured all the slings and arrows of Trumps abuse without complaint and had only praise for his former boss in his campaign announcement. If Trump gets in the Alabama political swamp he might lose again, as he did backing Luther Strange in 2017, or help disgraced former Judge Roy Moore win the nomination again in a divided field.



- The American Enterprise Institute’s Matthew Continetti is always a must-read for us. Few political writers, left, right or center, can match his combination of gifts of language and perception while maintaining the requisite honest self-appraisal to avoid dogmatism. His analysis of this week’s Virginia election results is perfect proof: “As Virginia has moved into the Democratic column, the state Republican Party has become more populist, more nationalist, and more culturally conservative. The dwindling number of Republicans who spoke the language of suburbia could not escape their party's national reputation for hostility to immigrants and opposition to progressive ideals. A similar process occurred in states like California, Colorado, and Nevada. It may also be underway in Arizona and Texas (!).”



- How about a little shameless self-promotion? You can hear Chris on the most recent installment of Jonah Goldberg’s Remnant podcast. It’s got it all: Cutting edge analysis, cured meat, “Caddyshack” and the dangers of political determinism. Listen here.



- Writing at the NYT Timothy Egan explores the dangers of “insufferable wokeness” for Democrats looking to win converts ahead of the 2020 election. “It’s no mystery why so many Democrats can no longer connect to the white working class. Progressives promise free college, free health care, free child care, and scream in bafflement, What’s wrong with you people? No doubt, some of those people are racist and xenophobic. But many others simply feel insulted and dismissed.” Democrats interested in forging a winning coalition ought to read Egan right after they finish watching Aziz Ansari’s latest comedy special “Right Now.” And if they don’t have time for that, just try the one-minute clip of former President Barack Obama who reminded listeners: “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly.” More addition, less division, please.



- Speaking of good things to watch, we loved director David Michôd’s interpretation of William Shakespeare’s “Henry V.” The film, called “The King,” distributed by Netflix and starring Timothée Chalamet, is wonderful in many ways, not the least of which is in rescuing the character John Falstaff from the clammy clutches of venal buffoonery in which so many directors have placed him. But the obvious great omission is one of Shakespeare’s finest speeches: The St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. There is perhaps no finer, fuller expression of patriotism and the duty of men at arms than the speech. But we know that Chalamet’s take on Hal wouldn’t allow for such heroic orations. And who would want to follow Kenneth Branagh’s unsurpassable performance? So by all means watch “The King,” but maybe also take three minutes to watch Branagh raise the banner – “we few, we happy few, we band of brothers” – to get in the right spirit this Veteran’s Day weekend.



THE RULEBOOK: RULES ARE RULES

“When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with eagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 73



TIME OUT: ALLES KLAR, HERR KOMMISSAR?

WSJ: “On the evening of Nov. 9, 1989, an unremarkable East German functionary named Günter Schabowski bungled an assignment – and accidentally helped bring down the Berlin Wall. … At a press conference that was broadcast live … [Schabowski] broached the topic only in the final minutes, after a stultifying, hourlong description of the East German regime’s internal debates. … Then a reporter asked about travel possibilities for East Germans. Schabowski initially answered in soporific fashion, with frequent pauses and ‘uhs.’ But then he mumbled that the party had decided ‘to issue a regulation that will make it possible for every citizen…to emigrate.’ A reporter shouted, ‘When does that go into force?’ The interruption visibly irritated Schabowski, who fumbled with his briefing papers to search for the answer. His aide finally pointed out the relevant page, and Schabowski read the text aloud so rapidly as to be almost incomprehensible… Someone shouted again, ‘When does that go into force?’ Schabowski scanned the unfamiliar text again and picked out some of its words: ‘Immediately…without delay.’ … Caught unprepared, the secret police, border guards and military forces scrambled to reassert their power, but it was too little, too late.”

POLL: BATTLEGROUND DEMS WANT MODERATE NOMINEE

NYT: “Democrats in the country’s most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states. As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground. A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The party’s voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society.”



Report: Steyer aide offered money for endorsements in Iowa - AP: “A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations. The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer’s Iowa campaign, aren’t illegal — though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There’s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer’s campaign as compensation for their backing. But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer’s campaign would think he could purchase their support.”



DEMS DISCUSS OPTIONS FOR ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT

ABC News: “House Democrats have considered drafting as many as three articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, as they prepare to take their Ukraine impeachment inquiry public next week… No decisions have been made, and what happens will ultimately be shaped by the conclusions and findings of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. … Democrats have floated the possibility of charging Trump with abuse of power for efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s family and the 2016 election, as well as obstruction of Congress for the administration’s refusal to comply with subpoenas for records and witness testimony. They have also weighed an obstruction of justice charge centered on the president’s efforts to obstruct former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Mueller’s findings in the second volume of his report, focused on obstruction, are repeatedly referenced in the report accompanying their resolution laying out the impeachment inquiry.”



Mulvaney defies subpoena - Fox News: “Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Friday defied a subpoena to appear before House committees for a deposition as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Mulvaney was called to testify on Friday at 9 a.m., but did not show up. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed Mulvaney after the White House rejected the original request for him to appear. Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee Acting Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., had wanted to hear from the top White House official, claiming he had ‘substantial first-hand knowledge and information’ relevant to the inquiry.”



Drucker: Republicans see Mark Meadows angling for Mulvaney’s job - WashEx: “There is growing talk on Capitol Hill that Mark Meadows is angling to become the next White House chief of staff amid signs President Trump has been unhappy with the current acting holder of the position, Mick Mulvaney. The conservative Republican congressman in recent days accompanied Trump to New York to attend a mixed martial arts fight and then joined the president a couple of days later for a campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky — trips and locales with no connection to the Republican congressman’s western North Carolina House district. Meadows, like Trump, was a real estate developer before entering politics and has played a key role in defending the president against impeachment. … ‘Of course that’s what he wants,’ a Republican congressman told the Washington Examiner, requesting anonymity in order to speak candidly. At least one White House aide shares that opinion.”



Judge orders Trump to pay $2 million to charities over foundation misuse -WaPo: “A New York judge on Thursday ordered President Trump to pay $2 million in damages for misusing funds from a tax-exempt charity — taking the charity’s money to pay debts for his for-profit businesses, to boost his 2016 campaign and to buy a painting of himself, according to court documents. That order, from state Judge Saliann Scarpulla, settled a lawsuit filed against Trump last year by the New York attorney general. It marked an extraordinary moment: The president of the United States acknowledged in a court filing that he had failed to follow basic laws about how charities should be governed. Previously, Trump had insisted the charity was run properly and the suit was a partisan sham. ‘Mr. Trump owed fiduciary duties to the Foundation,’ Scarpulla wrote in the order, meaning duties to safeguard the foundation’s money. ‘Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation.’”



OUTSIDE GROUPS SWAMP VULNERABLE GOP SENATORS

Politico: “A quartet of new nonprofit groups has already spent millions of dollars hammering four of the most vulnerable Republican senators on the ballot next year, sparking a wave of concern among strategists trying to protect the GOP’s slim three-seat Senate majority in 2020. Outside groups in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Iowa have already spent or booked over $1 million in each state — and in some cases much more, according to Advertising Analytics — on advertising criticizing the senators, more than doubling the spending from Republican-aligned groups trying to respond. And in one state, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) has faced the onslaught without any backup from Republican allies. … [The U.S. Chamber of Commerce] is partnering with state affiliates to boost Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) with six-figure ad buys amid the spending deluge against them, running positive ads focused on local issues there and in North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) faces a primary and a general election challenge.”



Pressure grows on Bevin to put up proof or concede - Lexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: “A growing number of Republican lawmakers are urging Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a fellow Republican, to either provide evidence of the voting ‘irregularities’ he has alleged or concede Tuesday’s election to Gov.-elect Andy Beshear, who defeated him by 5,189 votes. ‘The best thing to do, the right thing to do, is for Governor Bevin to concede the election today so we can move on,’ said Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville. … Bevin bolstered that speculation Wednesday by claiming that thousands of absentee ballots were counted illegally without presenting any proof to back up his claim. Republicans in the legislature aren’t buying it.Nemes said he has not seen much support for an election challenge among his Republican colleagues in the House, largely because the governor has not backed up his claims. None of the lawmakers the Herald-Leader spoke to Thursday said they had seen evidence to support Bevin’s claims.”



GOP candidate in Louisiana’s governor’s race sees fundraising boost - AP: “Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is raking in more campaign cash after becoming the lone GOP contender in the Louisiana governor’s race against Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. Rispone, owner of an industrial contracting firm, had largely self-financed his campaign in the primary election as he competed with another Republican, U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, for dollars. But that’s changing since Rispone reached the Nov. 16 runoff and the competition between the Republican challenger and the Deep South’s only Democratic governor tightened. Finance reports filed with the state ethics administration office Wednesday night show Rispone raised just under $3 million from donors in the latest period, which began shortly before the primary election and ended Oct. 27.”

THANKSGIVING COULDN’T COME AT A BETTER TIME

News 12 New Jersey: “Wild turkeys are running amok at an over-55 community in Ocean County [N.J.]. Residents say turkeys in a large flock are blocking their doorways, pecking at cars and behaving aggressively. ‘I can't get out of my door,’ says one resident. ‘Sometimes I can't get out of my car. They go to attack you.’ Just in time for Thanksgiving, an aggressive gaggle of 40 to 60 wild turkeys is terrorizing the community in the Holiday City section of town. Residents say that shooing the birds away doesn't help, and that they actually bite. Some say that the turkeys have even broken windows in people's houses. Meanwhile, Toms River says its animal control officers are powerless to stop the turkeys because they are not licensed to trap wildlife. A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection said that Fish and Game is aware of the situation but did not have further information or comment.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Of all the great imperial powers, America is probably the least imperially minded. Britain and France, at their height, would have stayed in the Gulf after such an extraordinary military victory to rearrange the map and establish themselves as hegemons. The United States, in contrast, could not wait to get out and go home.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in The New Republic on July 29, 1991.

The recent announcement of a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis represents but the latest example of American innovation delivering for patients — innovation that a government-run health care system could destroy.

As the mother of a 5-year-old daughter with cystic fibrosis, I recognize the very real challenges she and the other 30,000 Americans with cystic fibrosis face every day: The daily breathing treatments and chest physical therapy to maintain lung function, the numerous oral and inhaled medications, the constant fear of developing respiratory infections, and the grim future of a life expectancy that averages just 44 years.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS, DOCTORS CELEBRATE FDA'S 'LIFE-CHANGING' APPROVAL OF NEW TREATMENT

Trikafta, the new treatment recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, targets the genes that cause cystic fibrosis patients to build up mucus in their lungs and organs.

For the 90 percent of cystic fibrosis patients with genes that respond to Trikafta – many of whom previously lacked access to effective therapies – this drug could turn cystic fibrosis into a more readily managed chronic disease.

As a result, many cystic fibrosis patients could now have the promise of an average life expectancy, if not a completely normal life.

As thrilling as Trikafta sounds for my daughter, I worry about whether patients like her would have access to this drug under Democratic proposals for a single-payer health care system.

For instance, Britain’s single-payer system spent the past four years denying patients access to another cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi. While American patients have accessed Orkambi since 2015, only in the past month did the National Health Service finally allow 5,000 cystic fibrosis British patients to access a drug the government had previously dubbed “unaffordable.”

When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., finally released details of her single-payer health care plan, a prominent name appeared on the document: Donald Berwick.

Berwick, whom even a Democratic-run Senate would not confirm to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, spent much of his career defending the kind of rationing systems that the British National Health Service used for years to deny cystic fibrosis patients access to Orkambi.

In fact, Berwick, who won a knighthood for his work in Britain’s government-run health system, said that ""the decision is not whether or not we will ration care – the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.""

A statement like Berwick’s is frightening and should scare anyone who knows someone with a costly disease.

Trikafta took three decades to develop. Scientists first isolated the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis in 1989. Vertex, which developed the treatment, has set a high price tag for Trikafta, at $311,000. But a treatment that can extend life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients by decades, while also improving the quality of life for my daughter and patients like her, is still worthwhile even at that price.

A government-run health care system could block Americans’ access to treatments like Trikafta – or, worse yet, stifle medical innovation altogether, and discourage companies from creating breakthroughs in the first place.

My daughter, and other individuals like her who are fighting for their lives, deserve the best health care that American innovation can provide. Here’s hoping that she never faces the prospect of a government-run health care system that could cut off her access to critically important care."

""We have a fractured American family,"" Sheindlin began, adding she believed that while there are people like Maher who despise President Trump, there are also others who ""adore"" the president. She went on to blast lawmakers on Capitol Hill for their lack of legislating.

""The parties have become so angry with each other that nothing is happening,"" Sheindlin, a 77-year-old retired family court judge, whose popular TV show has been airing for nearly 25 years, observed.

Democrats prepare to go public with their impeachment probe. But will the televised hearings change anything?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves. But also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: They've gone out of their way to find the people that hate President Trump the most.

WALLACE: After weeks of closed-door testimony, lawmakers will question witnesses in public about whether the president abused his office to get oppo research from Ukraine.

We'll ask two members of the committee leading inquiry, Republican Will Hurd, a moderate whose actions will be watched closely by other members of his party, and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

Then, former New York City mayor and billionaire businessman, Michael Bloomberg, weighs a late entry into the Democratic race for president.

TRUMP: He's not going to do well but I think he's going to hurt Biden actually. Little Michael will fail.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump moves into a key new phase this week, public hearings, in which career government officials will testify on camera about how President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The big question: will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan?

In a moment, we'll speak with two members of the House Intelligence Committee that will hold the made-for-TV hearings, Republican Will Hurd and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

But, first, let's bring in Ellison Barber, who has the latest from the White House -- Ellison.

ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors. It was his understanding that everything, military aid and an Oval Office visit, was contingent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens in 2016.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: The 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down. Three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates. On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and a top State Department official. On Friday, the former ambassador to Ukraine.

House Democrats released their closed door testimonies this week. William Taylor's arguably the most explosive. The career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to pursue the investigations President Trump wanted.

President Trump continues to call the inquiry --

TRUMP: The witch hunt continues --

BARBER: But claims his party is on the same page.

TRUMP: The Republicans have never been so united.

BARBER: Congressional Republicans want to hear from at least 14 witnesses, including former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and the whistle- blower whose complaint help initiate the impeachment inquiry.

Chairman Adam Schiff responding with a warning: The committee will not serve as vehicles to carry out sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: Rules approved by the House essentially give Democrats veto power here. It witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee or the full committee -- Chris.

WALLACE: Ellison Barber, reporting from the White House -- Ellison, thank you.

BARBER: You bet.

WALLACE: Joining me now, Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican member of the House Intel Committee that will conduct those public hearings this week.

Congressman Hurd, the top Republican on House Intel, Devin Nunes, says that he would like to call the whistle-blower, the unnamed whistle-blower, to testify in public in these hearings.

And here's what President Trump has to say about the whistle-blower.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The whistle-blower is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace, and the whistle-blower, because of that, should be revealed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Now, the whistle-blower reportedly works for the CIA, where you worked for almost a decade.

Should his identity be revealed? Should be he called to testify in public?

REP. WILL HURD, R-TX: I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle-blower. I've said that from the very beginning, because how we treat this whistle-blower will impact whistle-blowers in the future. Having this whistle-blower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance not only in the Intelligence Committee, but our government.

But what I do would like to see happen is for Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle-blower before the information, his (ph) -- the whistle-blower's allegations were transmitted to the -- to Congress.

He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about -- or the contact that he had with the whistle-blower. So if you want to protect the identity of the whistle-blower, I think it's important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them (ph).

WALLACE: What to think about as the Republicans are seeking, calling Hunter Biden, the vice president -- the former vice president's son, as a witness?

HURD: I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma. I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes (ph) on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.

You know, this is -- we also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue. And Ambassador Taylor has said that in his testimony. Dr. Hill has said that in her testimony. This is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in Ukraine.

So, hearing from people that can help provide insights into that, since that is, you know, central to this conversation would be -- would be valuable.

WALLACE: Now, Congressman Schiff responded last night to the GOP witness list that had been offered by Chairman Nunes and here's what Schiff said: The Intel Committee will not be used, quote, to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens and 2016 that the president wanted Ukraine to conduct.

Given that response, Congressman Hurd, what does that say about the fairness of a process that the Democrats are running and holding these hearings?

HURD: Unfortunately, Chris, this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning. When one piece of information comes, people that don't like the president say, oh, this is an example for impeachment. People that support the president say, this is a -- you know, evidence of an exoneration.

I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth. And it's unfortunate that the Democrats on the committee and the Democrats in the House have created this partisan exercise.

In a normal hearing, the minority, the folks that are not in power, have the ability to offer a witness. We can't do that in this case.

Under previous impeachment inquiries, the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses, be involved.

You -- the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were -- that were testifying. That's not a fair process.

If we're interested in trying to uncover the truth, then let's not -- let's not put our thumb on the scale. But unfortunately, that's what this process has been and what's even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year, and I think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year. Half of those days are what's called ""fly-in, fly-out"" days where people are coming in from their location.

So, to try to get that, try to pass NAFTA, to fund the government -- to try to do all that in that short period of time, I think that's next to impossible.

WALLACE: You -- you talk about the extreme partisanship, maybe on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. You are not -- while you're supportive of the president, you are not a party line supportive. You oppose some of his policies, for instance, constructing the border wall. You've opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office.

For you, what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings?

HURD: So, I think talk about impeachment has been premature. I think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of Congress can do. And I think there's 535 different opinions on what impeachment is. To evaluate -- to evaluate that question I think it's a violation of the law.

So, I want to see, does this establish a criminal intent? And yes, for me, I agree when I agree, I disagree when I disagree.

And having spent nine-and-a-half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, I was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence. I also did this to embassies. I know how embassies work.

And the fact that Ukrainian officials weren't contacting their U.S. counterparts until August 29th, when they read in -- I believe it was a political article about aid being withheld. That was the first time that any Ukrainian had contacted a State Department or government official about this. That was more than a month after the July 25th phone call between the president and President Zelensky.

WALLACE: So --

(CROSSTALK)

HURD: What do I want to see?

WALLACE: Go ahead, sir.

HURD: Go ahead, Chris.

WALLACE: No, you go ahead.

HURD: What -- what I want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent. Do the Ukrainians know that this -- you know, this was some kind of a quid pro quo?

You know, when you look at our relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine over the last three years, there's been no more aid going to Ukraine this year than -- in this administration than the previous administration. Ukraine is an important partner.

WALLACE: Let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo. One was military aid. One was the meeting that the Ukrainians very much wanted between their President Zelensky and President Trump.

All three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week -- you see them up there, William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch, all career foreign service officers, said there was a clear connection between support for Ukraine, at various forms of the U.S. support for Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating the Democrats.

If you are satisfied that that is true, that there was this connection, this nexus, is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: Well, I don't know if it was necessarily investigate the Democrats, right? I think it was investigation of corruption. And so, people have made assumption of what is --

WALLACE: Forgive me, sir, but specifically --

HURD: Sure.

WALLACE: -- what President Trump said on that July 25th phone call was investigate the Democratic role in the 2016 election, whether they were involved in hacking the DNC server and also, specifically, the Bidens and Burisma.

HURD: Well, on the 2016 elections -- now, some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking. But back when even Democrats start investigating the Russian involvement on 2016 elections, there was a Ukraine nexus.

And so, trying to get to the bottom of that, is that a violation of the law? Now, was that an understanding based on debunked information? Yes. But is that a violation of the law? I don't think so.

You mentioned of the Bidens --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But specifically, sir, the question, is if there was a quid pro quo, U.S. aid for Ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president. Is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing. I think everybody has -- most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.

WALLACE: So, that, in your view, if that were established to your satisfaction, if, I repeat, that would be an impeachable offense?

HURD: I believe that's something that would make it -- make it -- have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.

WALLACE: And we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you.

Congressman Hurd, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Good to talk with you, sir.

HURD: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll get reaction from a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee about what some say is his party's timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: House Republicans have complained for weeks about Democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors. Well, now, the public hearings are about to start. The GOP is still complaining.

Let's bring in Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

Congressman, as I discussed with Congressman Hurd, Republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses. It includes Hunter Biden, the unnamed whistle-blower, and Nellie Ohr, who folks may remember, she worked for Fusion GPS, which sought information from sources in Ukraine in 2016 and put up the Steele dossier.

Will Democrats agree to call any of these witnesses? And if you don't, what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding?

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, D-N.Y.: Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but what I can tell you is that I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list. And here's my test -- my test is, do these witnesses have important information, knowledge, or evidence about the president's conduct? And if it passes that test, then we should call them, sure.

WALLACE: So, let's ask specifically. Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, the unnamed whistle-blower -- do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called?

MALONEY: The first two, no. The third one, you've just heard Congressman Hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don't force the revelation of a whistle-blower's identity. So, no in all three cases, but for different reasons.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, let's -- let's focus on Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is at the center of this. There are allegations of corruption. You know, there certainly are questions why a fellow named Hunter Biden would get a big job in Ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with Ukraine.

Isn't that a fair person to talk to?

MALONEY: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Wallace, what information Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors, would have about the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine? In other words, he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here, that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearings.

WALLACE: So, you know, I don't have the list right in front of me, but you obviously saw it. You're a member of the committee. Which member of the Republican potential witnesses would you agree to call?

MALONEY: Again, there are witnesses on the Republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and, of course, those transcripts are going to be released fully. And so, I would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed, because they have material information, would be likely called in public, but again, those are not --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: For instance, Kurt Volker, who was a special emissary to Ukraine?

MALONEY: Mr. Volker testified for the committee, so did Mr. Morrison. Those witnesses are on the list. Mr. Hale is similarly a witness who's been interviewed, is on the list. Those are the witnesses I have in mind.

But again, this is not my decision. I can't speak for the chairman, but those witnesses do have material information about the president's conduct in this case. That's the proper focus of this inquiry.

And if I could just say, Chris, you know, I hope your viewers will keep an open mind. You know, this is Veterans Day weekend, God bless all who serve and where the country's uniform as my dad did, as my grandfather did.

You know, these are also military veterans. Ambassador Taylor was an infantry officer with 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, served in combat.

WALLACE: Right.

MALONEY: West Point graduate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman earned a Purple Heart in Iraq.

These are -- these are veterans and credible witnesses. I hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript. By all means, they are all coming out in public.

WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about another -- apparently non-witness at this point and that his national security advisor -- former national security advisor John Bolton. Here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee: Bolton was involved, according to his lawyer, in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.

Continuing the quote: If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear, that is the House's decision.

Isn't -- Congressman, isn't John Bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the Oval Office? And why on earth wouldn't you wait to see what he has to say?

MALONEY: We have -- we have invited Ambassador Bolton to appear, and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me, because they are -- they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait --

MALONEY: Excuse me --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Let me just -- wait a minute. But the point is he has gone to a judge and said, you tell us, I got an order from the White House, I got an order from Congress, you tell me what to do.

MALONEY: Right. Mr. Wallace, that's not how it works. You show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed, or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question.

It is unprecedented to say, you, Congress, go to a judge and tell me to appear. That's not how it works, and Ambassador Bolton is a better lawyer than that. He knows that personally.

WALLACE: Wait. That isn't what they're doing. They're not saying, Congress, go to the judge. They are going to the judge.

That's what they did with Charles Kupperman, another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to Bolton and Bolton -- they are going to the judge and they're saying, judge, we've got these competing claims, you tell us what to do. They're not asking the House to do anything.

MALONEY: Mr. Wallace, I agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from Ambassador Bolton. I think the public deserves to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it, who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the White House because he knew they were improper.

Ambassador Bolton does have important information. I don't understand why the White House has instructed him not to cooperate. You should ask them.

WALLACE: Yes. I guess what I'm saying is this is an impeachment. This isn't just oversight. This is the potential impeachment of the president of the United States.

There is going to be a court hearing in early December, Charles Kupperman, the deputy to Bolton and Bolton now would be part of that suit.

Why not wait -- we're talking about a month, exactly a month, to find out what a judge says? Why wouldn't, when you're talking about the impeachment of the president, why wouldn't the House Intelligence Committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence?

MALONEY: Again, we would love to have Mr. Bolton's evidence. There's nothing preventing him from giving it. But remember -- oh, and by the way, any notion that that's going to be favorable to the president I think is debunked by everything in the public domain already.

Ambassador Bolton called this a drug deal. I'm not sure the president will want to hear from Ambassador Bolton, but we sure do.

But here's the point. The point is, do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we're going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the Senate, where there will be a trial, where witnesses like Ambassador Bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know. I encourage them to do it now, I encourage them to do it then and I don't think it will be favorable to the president. It is Ambassador Bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president's conduct was.

WALLACE: You know, he's not going to be -- testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year.

Let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up. President Trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call -- not the July 25th a phone call that we've already seen but an earlier phone call in April just after President Zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents.

What value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation?

MALONEY: Well, I don't know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president. If the president wants to release it, that's fine. I don't think it's relevant to this investigation.

WALLACE: Let's turn to the public hearings this week. You've got three witnesses testifying, we've already seen the transcripts of their interviews. People know what they're going to say.

Is the argument that you're basically -- people are going to read the book but they're going to see the movie? Because that didn't work out very well in the Robert Mueller testimony.

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, the point is that the Republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony. So, you know, they should take yes for an answer. I think it's very important that the public be able to judge for itself.

And I really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings. Read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds. You won't have any filter. You won't have the press or politicians in the way. You'll have witnesses giving opening statements.

And these are military veterans. These are career nonpartisan civil servants. The first witness, Ambassador Bill Taylor --

(CROSSTALK)

MALONEY: Excuse me, is an appointee of a Republican president who serve this country in the military. I think we should give him a chance.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Sir, you've already made that point and I would like to get -- I'm running out of time, I'd like to get one last question in if I might.

Here's what President Trump says about all those witnesses. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any first-hand knowledge, there is no firsthand knowledge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: The president does have a point. None of these officials actually talked to the president.

When we think back to John Dean with Richard Nixon, he took us into the Oval Office. He told what he told the president and what the president told him.

As the president says, all of the information we're going to hear this week is secondhand. Is that enough to impeach a president?

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, if you're talking about this week -- but, of course, there witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, who spoke directly to the president. There are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate.

By the way, the State Department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence, but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president's phone call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong, what he heard. That's a military veteran.

There are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it's -- honestly, if I can say, it is heartbreaking to hear the president, any American president, deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information. It's also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any American president would engage in misconduct. You know, it gives me no pleasure to tell you the American president has abused his office and he should be accountable.

WALLACE: Well, as you say, people are going to get to see for themselves this week.

Congressman Maloney, thank you, thanks for joining us. And, of course, FOX News will cover the hearings this week live.

MALONEY: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Democratic front runner Joe Biden reacts to Michael Bloomberg looking at a run for the White House.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how a Bloomberg campaign would shake up the Democratic race. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: As we are more testimony, in fact the testimony that we're hearing today, it's actually getting easier to defend the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Republican Congressman Mark Meadows setting very different expectations for this week's public impeachment hearings.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes.

Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you.

What do you expect these public hearings to accomplish? We know what these witnesses are going to say. They -- we -- they -- their opening statements were leaked. Their full hours long transcripts have been -- have been put out there for anybody who's interested to read. They've been widely covered. It doesn't seem to have moved anybody. I mean the Democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn't seem to have been a single vote that's been swayed so far at least by House Republicans in favor of impeachment.

So what's the point?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD: Well, I mean, now it's time for the American people to see the evidence. I mean let's admit it, even -- I've read some of the transcripts but haven't read all of them and I think for the American people to be able to see these witnesses, to know their, you know, their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee, and I think that that will be really compelling.

And, you know, maybe it's not about swaying individual members of Congress right now, but it's about making sure that the American people put it out there because Congress are followers, right? They'll follow the public. And I think that it's really important for the American people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the United States.

WALLACE: Karl, let's talk about the -- what we're going to hear in terms of the testimony this week. You worked in a White House. We're going to hear from three career foreign service officers. One of them, William Taylor, a military veteran, has served presidents since 1985. Ronald Reagan. They're going to talk about an off the books foreign policy. They're going to talk about an ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made, a campaign being run by Rudy Giuliani, allegedly. They're going to hear about a link between U.S. support for Ukraine and Ukraine conducting investigations of the president's political rivals.

Obviously there's another side to the story, but that story, does it bother you?

KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who served in the White House, it does bother me, yes. But, on the other hand, there is constant friction between the State Department and an administration. We saw this during the Iraq War, where we had the people in the State Department leaking against the administration's policy. But, look, that's going to be the sideshow.

The thing that's going to happen when we have this testimony is, is that the Republicans are going to be able to ask questions. Think about where we've been. We have selective leaks of what -- of what these people said, which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president. Then we have their entire transcripts, which most people don't read. Now we're going to have televised hearings in which they're going to be able to say their piece and it's going to have an impact, but there also going to be questioned. And the questioning is going to get to, you know, we have a quid. Military aid and assistance for Ukraine. And we have a quo. And that quo is, investigative the Bidens and any other American involved in corruption. But so far we don't have the pro, the for, that is to say that what we know today is, is that the Ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed. And we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate Joe Biden.

And we're -- and the failure of the Democrats -- Schiff's statement last night was very problematic because the American people are going to want to hear about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Devon Archer (ph) and this stinky situation involving Burisma. And if the Democrats say, we're not going to allow you to have those people called, it's just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt.

WALLACE: Mo.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Ambassador Sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the Ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this. So that's -- that's about where we are on that point.

Look, ultimately, I agree with the congresswoman, that now the American people get to see this stuff. And if you think about this politically and what actually -- you know, based on the very few precedents we have in American history on this, looking back on Richard Nixon, Republicans were with him. Republican voters were with him up until the very end. The day he left, the polling show that about 30 percent of Republicans thought he should be removed from office. But that 30 percent was a significant number because that's what put a lot of pressure on the Republican members of the Senate, when Barry Goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said, Mr. President, you know I've been your guy but it's become unsustainable for us. Right now you don't see that kind of breaking from Republican voters.

So the question becomes, do these hearings, as the congresswoman was saying, begin to mobilize and catalyze Republican voters? We know it's doing it for Democrats and we know it's doing it for independent voters.

WALLACE: But here's the question I have, and let me bring in Josh on this, because I understand that, you know, we pay much more attention to the leaks, we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do, but they are out there and they have been widely reported. They've been the lead on the evening news. They've been on the front page of the papers. And so far, Josh, it hasn't moved a single Republican vote.

JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Nor has it moved the Republican primary electorate. I mean I think, Mo, you have a good point there and what ultimately did in Nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him. If you look at the American people right now, in particular the Republican primary electorate, not only are they not moving away from the president, it's heartening. I mean you've got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote/unquote witch hunt.

So I -- look, we're a long way away from Republicans moving away from President Trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry. My guess is an open hearing in the House will only serve to exacerbate that. I don't think there's any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in.

WALLACE: I mean, that is the concern, I mean, that it hasn't moved the needle. And we've gotten a lot of information so far. I don't -- I mean I understand a TV -- well, I don't know if I understand because we -- everybody kept saying, you know, they won't read the book, they'll watch the movie and the Mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for Democrats, I think we would agree.

So let's assume that this is more effective than Robert Mueller as a -- as a witness. Does it really move the needle? Because it hasn't so far, congresswoman.

EDWARDS: Well, look, this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the Mueller report. I mean we have a president of the United States who withheld aid from an ally who was, you know, on the front lines against our chief adversary. And I think when the American people here that it wasn't -- this isn't about 2016, this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election. And I think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference.

I mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel, Vindman, for example, you know, he'll be there and he'll be in his dress blues and, you know, fully decorated, raising his hand saying that he's telling the truth.

I defy Republicans to challenge on that. They are not challenging on the substance, they are challenging on process, and that is a loser argument.

WALLACE: All right, you get the final word.

ROVE: Process matters, fairness matters, that's why Nixon went down because the process was fair. This is not fair. They won't allow the -- they've got allowed the president any of the rights granted to President Clinton during his impeachment, or any of the rights granted to President Nixon during his impeachment.

And I love the fact -- I love the fact that the Democrats are now decrying the president's decision not to move aid -- lethal aid rapidly to Ukraine. After all, the previous administration, a Democratic administration, did nothing to send lethal aid to Ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into Ukraine on C-130s because they didn't want U.S. military presence in Ukraine. So they drop them off in Poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to Ukraine.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: So this president at least had the guts to give the Ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the Russian attempts to subvert that country.

WALLACE: Well, I think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we're -- it will be a bipartisan game changer.

Panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 Democratic race. Can he win the nomination?

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a Bloomberg candidacy? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at “Fox News Sunday” and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: There's nobody I'd rather run against the little Michael.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Well, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both President Trump and Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders on a possible run for the White House.

And we're back now with the panel.

Mo, let me start with you.

Does Michael Bloomberg have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in, and it seems likely will, his plan, skip the first four, skip Iowa, skip New Hampshire, and basically begin your campaign on Super Tuesday in early March?

ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, it's an uphill climb, I would think, for -- for Mayor Bloomberg. And there's no evidence -- we've never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination. Not at least in the modern era. We've seen candidates who have tried to skip a state, skip Iowa and go straight to New Hampshire, skip New Hampshire and so to South Carolina --

WALLACE: Rudy Giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to Florida. That doesn't work out so well.

ELLEITHEE: Right, it just doesn't -- it doesn't work out so well.

But I think what Bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate's last line of defense against the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders wing of the party. That if Biden stumbles and is falling behind --

WALLACE: And right now he's in fourth place in Iowa and -- and not leading in New Hampshire either.

ELLEITHEE: And that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization. And those later states, to his credit, are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states. He's got the money to invest heavily in advertising, that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates' last line of defense. I think -- I'm a little skeptical that it works, but it is a strategy that, you know, that if Biden stumbles, it looks like he's going to, you know, try to put himself in position to execute.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that Michael Bloomberg will get into this race, we got this on Facebook from Brad Yates. He writes, how does Bloomberg's stance on corporations stand against the current Democrat party's push toward socialism?

Congressman Edwards, how do you answer Brad basically on the -- on the question, is he just way too far to the right for this current Democratic Party?

EDWARDS: Well, I think that -- I mean I think that's a reasonable question but, look, there's no push toward socialism in the Democratic Party. But I do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the -- a Michael Bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center. And the question of, are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent, the bottom 60 percent of Americans? And I think that's a legitimate debate for Democrats to have. We've been having that in our -- within our party.

WALLACE: How about the argument that billionaires like Bill Gates, like Michael Bloomberg, create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that's actually what kind of feeds the bulldog?

EDWARDS: Absolutely they do and I worked for a corporation early in my career and I think that that is important.

But the question is, how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other Americans can aspire to their highest dreams too? Creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other Americans. I think that is a front and center debate of the Democratic Party and I think Michael Bloomberg's candidacy puts it right there in the middle.

And, you know, I'm looking forward to the debate because I think we've been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it's going to be important for any Democrat who wins in the Democratic primary to be able to unite the party. And I'm really not sure that a Michael Bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the Democratic Party.

WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the elections that were held this last Tuesday night, which were very interesting, where Democrats took control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears, although the Republican governor of Kentucky still won't concede, it appears that the Democrats have won the governor's seat in Kentucky.

President Trump talked in Kentucky, campaigning for the Republican governor the night before. Here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You've got to vote, because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: So, Karl, how worried should the president and Republicans be, not so much about those specific results and those specific races, but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here, the suburbs. The suburbs in Virginia. The suburbs in Kentucky. The suburbs in Pennsylvania, around Philadelphia, this continuing move away from a Republican Party to the Democrats?

ROVE: Yes, and, look, all suburbs are not the same. You mentioned Kentucky. In Kentucky you had a very --

WALLACE: You brought your whiteboard?

ROVE: I brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the governor's race, the Republican got 48.8 percent of the vote. Right below him on the ballot is a fresh first-time candidate, African-American Republican candidate for attorney general, who gets 57.8 percent of the vote and 75,000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot, runs nine points ahead of him. The rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer --

WALLACE: My goodness, this is Kentucky. It's a pretty red state.

ROVE: I understand. I understand. But the point is, is that in the suburbs, those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the Republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the Republicans take all those down ballot offices, which says, if you've got good candidates who make an appeal, they can carry the Republican suburbs.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: But, warning, negative, southeast Pennsylvania, Montgomery Bucks (ph), Delaware and Chester, Republican strongholds. The Democrats took Delaware County for the first time. The county council is 5-0 Democrat. First time they've had a majority on the county council since the civil war.

And then in Virginia, we've known about northern Virginia fading away from the Republicans. In this election it was the Richmond suburbs of Henrico (ph) and Chesterfields (ph). The Republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and Kentucky says if you right -- run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of Democrat, you can win. But (INAUDIBLE) a problem.

WALLACE: I want to -- I want to bring Josh in.

There's the continuing fallout from Elizabeth Warren's continuing plans, spending, taxing trillions of dollars. And there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: When you say I should pay a hundred billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I don't like vilifying anybody. I -- you know, I think we should applaud successful people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Josh, Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of JP Morgan, are certainly rich, but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. What does that say to you? I mean, obviously, they're two billionaires who are -- I guess Dimon's not a billionaire, but two rich guys. What does that say to you about their problems that Elizabeth Warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election?

HOLMES: I think the best sign that Elizabeth Warren has a real problem with sort of your center left Democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about Michael Bloomberg. I mean Michael Bloomberg said back in February that as long as Joe Biden is in this race and feels like he's got a comfortable hold on the nomination, he's not interested in running. But if the Democratic Party looks like it's auguring towards nominating somebody who's in that sort of left wing, sort of more extreme category --

WALLACE: But we should point out Michael Bloomberg's another billionaire.

HOLMES: Sure. Absolutely.

But here's the -- here's the point. The point is, is that Joe -- this all says a lot more about Joe Biden then it says about anything else. Joe Biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the Democratic primary electorate and the Democratic primary electorate is looking for an Elizabeth Warren. That's what -- you know, with all due respect to Bill Gates --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) Elizabeth Warren or --

HOLMES: No, no, with all -- with all due respect to Bill Gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the Democratic Party is, the Democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen, we like Elizabeth Warren. We like Bernie Sanders. We have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this -- in this primary electorate.

ELLEITHEE: You've got Biden and Buttigieg --

EDWARDS: Joe Biden --

ELLEITHEE: Are -- are doing about as well combined as Warren and Sanders are doing combined.

HOLMES: Well, he's -- look, he's lost --

ROVE: One's at seven and one's at 20.

ELLEITHEE: The moderates --

ROVE: And the other two are at 18 and 22.

ELLEITHEE: Not in Iowa. In Iowa those four are clustered very closely together.

Look, in 2018, more center left Democrats won congressional primaries than far left Democrats won congressional primaries with a primary (INAUDIBLE).

HOLMES: But it's not happening in the 2020 cycle. And I've got to tell you, people --

ROVE: There's a lot more far left Democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016.

ELLEITHEE: We'll see.

EDWARDS: This hasn't shaken out yet, so -- I mean it hasn't shaken out at all and everything's still (INAUDIBLE).

WALLACE: So the battle continues. Thank you all, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the dedication it takes to escort the nation's bravest to their final resting place.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: On this Veterans Day weekend, we want to introduce you to a special military unit whose mission is to pay final tribute to the men and women who have defended our freedom. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAPTAIN ZACKARY STEELMAN, U.S. ARMY OLD GUARD CAISSON PLATOON: It's our honor to be able to provide them the best ceremony that they deserve and that their families deserve, to just pay it back to them the way that they've paid it to us.

WALLACE: Captain Zackary Steelman is talking about the Old Guard Caisson Platoon that bears the casket for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.

Two teams go out, one with white horses, one with black. Each participating in as many as four funerals a day. But the platoon is determined every one will be special.

STEELMAN: That family isn't going to get a second funeral. We have to put as much effort and time into making sure every detail of what we do is the best we can make it.

Do what you've got to do.

WALLACE: A squad is up at 4:30 each morning to make sure it's perfect. The horses are sprayed till they glean. The tack is shined. And so is the caisson that carried a canon back in the First World War.

Then, the horses are hitched up. The lead team that takes the caisson through the cemetery, the swing team that gets around tight corners, and the wheel team that acts as breaks. Then, they call out the mission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attention to orders! Zero nine, grant (ph) the 12 alpha, colonel, United States Air Force.

Swing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lead?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wheel?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caisson forward! Out (ph)!

WALLACE (on camera): Why do you have to do all of that?

STEELMAN: Well, it's not that we have to do any of those things, sir, it's really that we get to do those things. We're about to perform a funeral and we're about to perform the mission for that family and we want to make sure that we're doing it to the absolute best ability that we have for them.

WALLACE (voice over): The caisson platoon is part of presidential funerals. A riderless horse named Black Jack was in John Kennedy's procession. When he stepped on his handlers toe, the soldier kept marching.

In 2004, the military honors were for Ronald Reagan. The riderless horse was named Sergeant York, he is still part of the platoon.

STEELMAN: Sergeant York is the oldest horse that we have here in the barn. He's actually 29.

WALLACE (on camera): Twenty-nine?

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: Reagan used to say that there's nothing as good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: He would have loved this one.

WALLACE (voice over): Captain Steelman signed up for the Army's armor branch. When he joined the caisson platoon, he had never been on a horse. Now he thinks it's as important as any other mission.

WALLACE (on camera): How long do you want to keep being in the caisson platoon.

STEELMAN: If I could, sir, I'd be here for the rest of my life. I absolutely love this job.

I get to see soldiers every single day put in a lot of hard work for someone they really don't even know. I'm honored to be able to bring them to their final resting place. And it's just an honor to be a part of that specific mission.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Horses in the caisson platoon are put up for adoption after the service is complete. And right now Elvira, a member of the swing team for 16 years, is available. If you want to find out more, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And before we go, here's a live look at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our colleagues at Fox NFL Sunday there for a special Veterans Day broadcast as a salute to the troops.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

Dimon, who is worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, spoke with CBS's Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"", where he touched on the causes of the 2008 financial crash, the American economy and cancer survival.

Stahl asked Dimon: ""So Elizabeth Warren said in Iowa the other day, 'Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful,' and you jumped in and said this week about her that she was 'vilifying successful people and having harsh words for Wall Street bankers.'""

Dimon responded: ""Most people are good, not all of 'em,"" adding, ""I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things. And so my comment is, I think it's American society – we're just attacking each other all the time.""

Dimon, who has been at the helm of America's biggest bank since 2005, has publicly spatted with Warren about the topic of billionaires, with the CEO saying in the past: ""She uses some pretty harsh words — some would say vilifies successful people. We should applaud successful people.""

In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, which aired on Sunday, Dimon also criticized Trump's tax cuts — despite the policy boosting JPMorgan profits $3.7 billion. JPMorgan has crushed earnings targets this year, with the last quarter results boasting a record level of revenue.

""I would not have cut the tax on the rich. I would've extended the Earned Income Tax Credit instead – which is like a negative income tax credit for lower-paid people,"" said Dimon in the interview.

He added: ""We probably should change the minimum wage, which I don't think has been changed for like 10 or 15 years. There are solutions to these problems. The problems are real. It does not mean Free Enterprise is bad.""

Dimon was also quizzed on his pay by Stahl in the heated exchange below:

Lesley Stahl: ""Let's talk about the wage gap in this country between the rich and almost everybody else. How much of a problem do you see that?""

Jamie Dimon: ""I think it's a huge problem and I think the wealthy have been getting wealthier too much, in many ways. So middle-class incomes have been kinda flat for maybe 15 years or so. And that's not particularly good in America. But in particular, at the low end, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less. They've particularly been left behind.""

Lesley Stahl: ""You're talking about people who earn very little money. Listen to this statistic. Compensation for executives, CEOs, grew 940%, 940%, in the last 40 years. Your average worker, so middle class, middle class, grew 12%.""

Jamie Dimon: ""We haven't done a good job growing our economy. And that would fix a lot of that problem.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Executive pay: Last year you were paid $31 million. Too high?""

Jamie Dimon: ""The board sets mine. I have nothing to do with it.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Well, you could return some of it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. Is that gonna solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""I don't know.""

Jamie Dimon: ""Is it going to solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""No but you could set an example and say, ""I'm not going to take all that money. I don't need it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. I'm going to leave it to the board to set my comp. Not you, not the press--""

Lesley Stahl: ""You've answered every one of my questions but this one you're fobbing off.'

Jamie Dimon: ""Yeah, the board has to do it.""

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): “You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?”

In a new interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, made a related argument:

“I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?”

Those familiar with American Civics 101 probably realize the reason “a bunch of people in Congress” are working on an impeachment inquiry is because that’s how the process is supposed to work under the U.S. Constitution. What’s more, we have “a bunch of people in Congress” grappling with how to address presidential abuses because “the American people” decided to put the House of Representatives in the hands of a Democratic majority – made up of members who ran on a platform of holding Trump accountable.

I’m going to assume that Haley, a former top member of Donald Trump’s team, knows all of this. I’ll also assume that the point she intended to make was about delaying judgment on the president’s apparent misconduct until Election Day 2020. Indeed, the former South Carolina governor added on Twitter over the weekend, “This is a decision for the American people.”

It’s an increasingly popular pitch in GOP circles. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who’ll retire from elected office next year, recently argued, “An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president.” Similarly, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, added yesterday, “Let the American people decide this in less than a year.”

At face value, this may seem like one of the GOP’s less ridiculous arguments. Trump was caught crossing the line, and if voters have a problem with the president’s abuses, they can vote for someone new next November. If, on the other hand, voters are unmoved, the electorate can make that clear, too.

There are, however, a couple of serious flaws with this.

NBC News’ First Read team published an item in September about the Ukraine scandal, just as it was starting to break, that stuck with me:

If this is what this looks like … then it’s arguably worse than Watergate, when the dirty tricks were being conducted by Americans against Americans. But this time, is the dirty trick a sitting president dangling aid to a foreign country to get it to investigate a rival campaign? We learned from 2016 that the Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. Do national Democrats – who believe defeating Trump in 2020, not impeaching him, is the best way to remove him from office – understand what else we might see over the next 14 months?

The Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. That, in a nutshell, is why the scandal can’t wait. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

As New York’s Jon Chait recently put it, “Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump’s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.”

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., put America's billionaires front-and-center on the campaign trail last week and mocked those speaking out against her proposed wealth tax.

""Boy, there are some billionaires who don't like this,"" Warren said Friday in Goose Creek, South Carolina. ""I think I hurt someone's feelings... This is sad. So... people are saying, 'Oh, I'm just mean to the billionaires.""

Among those speaking out against Warren's proposals last week were Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon even suggested Warren may have been vilifying ""successful people.""

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Stephen Moore, a former senior economic adviser to President Trump and a distinguished visiting fellow for the Heritage Foundation's Project for Economic Growth, took on Warren's case against America's wealthiest.

""The vast majority of people in the top 1 percent... [t]hey own, operate or invest in small businesses,"" Moore said. ""They are the job creators and the wealth creators of our economy.""

""Look at what Bill Gates and a person like Jeff Bezos have done,"" Moore added. ""They've created hundreds and thousands of jobs. They've created... higher incomes... I hate this bashing of the rich.""

Moore argued that policymakers should be more focused on growing the economy than redistributing the wealth of some Americans through higher taxes.

""What I care about is -- as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan used to say -- let's create a rising tide that lifts all boats. And, I think under Trump, that's what's happening. You know, we're seeing all income groups benefit from this expansion,"" he said.

John Grace, the founder and president of Investors Advantage Corp., argued that the growing disparity between the wealth of Americans needed to be addressed.

""I think it's worth noting in 1962, when we look at the top 1 percent versus the bottom 99 percent, at that point, it was pretty equal, 30 to 34 percent was the share of wealth,"" Grace said. ""By 2016, the top 1 percent is garnering over 40 percent of the wealth and the bottom 90 percent is generating a whopping 20 percent of the wealth. So, one has dramatically increased.""

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

In conclusion, Moore said he saw Warren's proposals as more punitive than productive.

""My friend, [economist] Art Laffer, says, 'You want a tax system that tries to make poor people rich, not make rich people poor.' Sometimes I think some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have that wrong,"" he said.

""There are certain problems out there. But... all I'm hearing from the Democrats right now is, sock it to the rich and give it to the poor... Income redistribution is not an economic growth plan,"" Moore concluded.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”



Pergram: The ‘impeachment resolution,’ and Dems' fight over its meaning - Fox News: “It didn’t matter what that resolution was called or wasn’t called a few weeks ago. Congress has descended into impeachapalooza. There’s no quibbling about what’s consuming Capitol Hill. Some Democrats may fret about the political ramifications of impeachment. Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.

Democrats prepare to go public with their impeachment probe. But will the televised hearings change anything?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves. But also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: They've gone out of their way to find the people that hate President Trump the most.

WALLACE: After weeks of closed-door testimony, lawmakers will question witnesses in public about whether the president abused his office to get oppo research from Ukraine.

We'll ask two members of the committee leading inquiry, Republican Will Hurd, a moderate whose actions will be watched closely by other members of his party, and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

Then, former New York City mayor and billionaire businessman, Michael Bloomberg, weighs a late entry into the Democratic race for president.

TRUMP: He's not going to do well but I think he's going to hurt Biden actually. Little Michael will fail.

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how Bloomberg's possible move could reshape the Democratic campaign.

And our ""Power Player of the Week"", the iconic horse-drawn caisson performing a solemn duty honoring our nation's fallen veterans.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump moves into a key new phase this week, public hearings, in which career government officials will testify on camera about how President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The big question: will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan?

In a moment, we'll speak with two members of the House Intelligence Committee that will hold the made-for-TV hearings, Republican Will Hurd and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

But, first, let's bring in Ellison Barber, who has the latest from the White House -- Ellison.

ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors. It was his understanding that everything, military aid and an Oval Office visit, was contingent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens in 2016.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: The 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down. Three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates. On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and a top State Department official. On Friday, the former ambassador to Ukraine.

House Democrats released their closed door testimonies this week. William Taylor's arguably the most explosive. The career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to pursue the investigations President Trump wanted.

President Trump continues to call the inquiry --

TRUMP: The witch hunt continues --

BARBER: But claims his party is on the same page.

TRUMP: The Republicans have never been so united.

BARBER: Congressional Republicans want to hear from at least 14 witnesses, including former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and the whistle- blower whose complaint help initiate the impeachment inquiry.

Chairman Adam Schiff responding with a warning: The committee will not serve as vehicles to carry out sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: Rules approved by the House essentially give Democrats veto power here. It witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee or the full committee -- Chris.

WALLACE: Ellison Barber, reporting from the White House -- Ellison, thank you.

BARBER: You bet.

WALLACE: Joining me now, Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican member of the House Intel Committee that will conduct those public hearings this week.

Congressman Hurd, the top Republican on House Intel, Devin Nunes, says that he would like to call the whistle-blower, the unnamed whistle-blower, to testify in public in these hearings.

And here's what President Trump has to say about the whistle-blower.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The whistle-blower is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace, and the whistle-blower, because of that, should be revealed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Now, the whistle-blower reportedly works for the CIA, where you worked for almost a decade.

Should his identity be revealed? Should be he called to testify in public?

REP. WILL HURD, R-TX: I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle-blower. I've said that from the very beginning, because how we treat this whistle-blower will impact whistle-blowers in the future. Having this whistle-blower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance not only in the Intelligence Committee, but our government.

But what I do would like to see happen is for Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle-blower before the information, his (ph) -- the whistle-blower's allegations were transmitted to the -- to Congress.

He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about -- or the contact that he had with the whistle-blower. So if you want to protect the identity of the whistle-blower, I think it's important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them (ph).

WALLACE: What to think about as the Republicans are seeking, calling Hunter Biden, the vice president -- the former vice president's son, as a witness?

HURD: I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma. I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes (ph) on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.

You know, this is -- we also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue. And Ambassador Taylor has said that in his testimony. Dr. Hill has said that in her testimony. This is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in Ukraine.

So, hearing from people that can help provide insights into that, since that is, you know, central to this conversation would be -- would be valuable.

WALLACE: Now, Congressman Schiff responded last night to the GOP witness list that had been offered by Chairman Nunes and here's what Schiff said: The Intel Committee will not be used, quote, to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens and 2016 that the president wanted Ukraine to conduct.

Given that response, Congressman Hurd, what does that say about the fairness of a process that the Democrats are running and holding these hearings?

HURD: Unfortunately, Chris, this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning. When one piece of information comes, people that don't like the president say, oh, this is an example for impeachment. People that support the president say, this is a -- you know, evidence of an exoneration.

I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth. And it's unfortunate that the Democrats on the committee and the Democrats in the House have created this partisan exercise.

In a normal hearing, the minority, the folks that are not in power, have the ability to offer a witness. We can't do that in this case.

Under previous impeachment inquiries, the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses, be involved.

You -- the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were -- that were testifying. That's not a fair process.

If we're interested in trying to uncover the truth, then let's not -- let's not put our thumb on the scale. But unfortunately, that's what this process has been and what's even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year, and I think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year. Half of those days are what's called ""fly-in, fly-out"" days where people are coming in from their location.

So, to try to get that, try to pass NAFTA, to fund the government -- to try to do all that in that short period of time, I think that's next to impossible.

WALLACE: You -- you talk about the extreme partisanship, maybe on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. You are not -- while you're supportive of the president, you are not a party line supportive. You oppose some of his policies, for instance, constructing the border wall. You've opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office.

For you, what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings?

HURD: So, I think talk about impeachment has been premature. I think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of Congress can do. And I think there's 535 different opinions on what impeachment is. To evaluate -- to evaluate that question I think it's a violation of the law.

So, I want to see, does this establish a criminal intent? And yes, for me, I agree when I agree, I disagree when I disagree.

And having spent nine-and-a-half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, I was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence. I also did this to embassies. I know how embassies work.

And the fact that Ukrainian officials weren't contacting their U.S. counterparts until August 29th, when they read in -- I believe it was a political article about aid being withheld. That was the first time that any Ukrainian had contacted a State Department or government official about this. That was more than a month after the July 25th phone call between the president and President Zelensky.

WALLACE: So --

(CROSSTALK)

HURD: What do I want to see?

WALLACE: Go ahead, sir.

HURD: Go ahead, Chris.

WALLACE: No, you go ahead.

HURD: What -- what I want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent. Do the Ukrainians know that this -- you know, this was some kind of a quid pro quo?

You know, when you look at our relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine over the last three years, there's been no more aid going to Ukraine this year than -- in this administration than the previous administration. Ukraine is an important partner.

WALLACE: Let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo. One was military aid. One was the meeting that the Ukrainians very much wanted between their President Zelensky and President Trump.

All three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week -- you see them up there, William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch, all career foreign service officers, said there was a clear connection between support for Ukraine, at various forms of the U.S. support for Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating the Democrats.

If you are satisfied that that is true, that there was this connection, this nexus, is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: Well, I don't know if it was necessarily investigate the Democrats, right? I think it was investigation of corruption. And so, people have made assumption of what is --

WALLACE: Forgive me, sir, but specifically --

HURD: Sure.

WALLACE: -- what President Trump said on that July 25th phone call was investigate the Democratic role in the 2016 election, whether they were involved in hacking the DNC server and also, specifically, the Bidens and Burisma.

HURD: Well, on the 2016 elections -- now, some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking. But back when even Democrats start investigating the Russian involvement on 2016 elections, there was a Ukraine nexus.

And so, trying to get to the bottom of that, is that a violation of the law? Now, was that an understanding based on debunked information? Yes. But is that a violation of the law? I don't think so.

You mentioned of the Bidens --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But specifically, sir, the question, is if there was a quid pro quo, U.S. aid for Ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president. Is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing. I think everybody has -- most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.

WALLACE: So, that, in your view, if that were established to your satisfaction, if, I repeat, that would be an impeachable offense?

HURD: I believe that's something that would make it -- make it -- have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.

WALLACE: And we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you.

Congressman Hurd, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Good to talk with you, sir.

HURD: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll get reaction from a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee about what some say is his party's timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: House Republicans have complained for weeks about Democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors. Well, now, the public hearings are about to start. The GOP is still complaining.

Let's bring in Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

Congressman, as I discussed with Congressman Hurd, Republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses. It includes Hunter Biden, the unnamed whistle-blower, and Nellie Ohr, who folks may remember, she worked for Fusion GPS, which sought information from sources in Ukraine in 2016 and put up the Steele dossier.

Will Democrats agree to call any of these witnesses? And if you don't, what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding?

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, D-N.Y.: Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but what I can tell you is that I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list. And here's my test -- my test is, do these witnesses have important information, knowledge, or evidence about the president's conduct? And if it passes that test, then we should call them, sure.

WALLACE: So, let's ask specifically. Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, the unnamed whistle-blower -- do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called?

MALONEY: The first two, no. The third one, you've just heard Congressman Hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don't force the revelation of a whistle-blower's identity. So, no in all three cases, but for different reasons.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, let's -- let's focus on Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is at the center of this. There are allegations of corruption. You know, there certainly are questions why a fellow named Hunter Biden would get a big job in Ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with Ukraine.

Isn't that a fair person to talk to?

MALONEY: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Wallace, what information Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors, would have about the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine? In other words, he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here, that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearings.

WALLACE: So, you know, I don't have the list right in front of me, but you obviously saw it. You're a member of the committee. Which member of the Republican potential witnesses would you agree to call?

MALONEY: Again, there are witnesses on the Republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and, of course, those transcripts are going to be released fully. And so, I would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed, because they have material information, would be likely called in public, but again, those are not --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: For instance, Kurt Volker, who was a special emissary to Ukraine?

MALONEY: Mr. Volker testified for the committee, so did Mr. Morrison. Those witnesses are on the list. Mr. Hale is similarly a witness who's been interviewed, is on the list. Those are the witnesses I have in mind.

But again, this is not my decision. I can't speak for the chairman, but those witnesses do have material information about the president's conduct in this case. That's the proper focus of this inquiry.

And if I could just say, Chris, you know, I hope your viewers will keep an open mind. You know, this is Veterans Day weekend, God bless all who serve and where the country's uniform as my dad did, as my grandfather did.

You know, these are also military veterans. Ambassador Taylor was an infantry officer with 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, served in combat.

WALLACE: Right.

MALONEY: West Point graduate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman earned a Purple Heart in Iraq.

These are -- these are veterans and credible witnesses. I hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript. By all means, they are all coming out in public.

WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about another -- apparently non-witness at this point and that his national security advisor -- former national security advisor John Bolton. Here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee: Bolton was involved, according to his lawyer, in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.

Continuing the quote: If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear, that is the House's decision.

Isn't -- Congressman, isn't John Bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the Oval Office? And why on earth wouldn't you wait to see what he has to say?

MALONEY: We have -- we have invited Ambassador Bolton to appear, and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me, because they are -- they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait --

MALONEY: Excuse me --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Let me just -- wait a minute. But the point is he has gone to a judge and said, you tell us, I got an order from the White House, I got an order from Congress, you tell me what to do.

MALONEY: Right. Mr. Wallace, that's not how it works. You show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed, or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question.

It is unprecedented to say, you, Congress, go to a judge and tell me to appear. That's not how it works, and Ambassador Bolton is a better lawyer than that. He knows that personally.

WALLACE: Wait. That isn't what they're doing. They're not saying, Congress, go to the judge. They are going to the judge.

That's what they did with Charles Kupperman, another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to Bolton and Bolton -- they are going to the judge and they're saying, judge, we've got these competing claims, you tell us what to do. They're not asking the House to do anything.

MALONEY: Mr. Wallace, I agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from Ambassador Bolton. I think the public deserves to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it, who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the White House because he knew they were improper.

Ambassador Bolton does have important information. I don't understand why the White House has instructed him not to cooperate. You should ask them.

WALLACE: Yes. I guess what I'm saying is this is an impeachment. This isn't just oversight. This is the potential impeachment of the president of the United States.

There is going to be a court hearing in early December, Charles Kupperman, the deputy to Bolton and Bolton now would be part of that suit.

Why not wait -- we're talking about a month, exactly a month, to find out what a judge says? Why wouldn't, when you're talking about the impeachment of the president, why wouldn't the House Intelligence Committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence?

MALONEY: Again, we would love to have Mr. Bolton's evidence. There's nothing preventing him from giving it. But remember -- oh, and by the way, any notion that that's going to be favorable to the president I think is debunked by everything in the public domain already.

Ambassador Bolton called this a drug deal. I'm not sure the president will want to hear from Ambassador Bolton, but we sure do.

But here's the point. The point is, do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we're going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the Senate, where there will be a trial, where witnesses like Ambassador Bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know. I encourage them to do it now, I encourage them to do it then and I don't think it will be favorable to the president. It is Ambassador Bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president's conduct was.

WALLACE: You know, he's not going to be -- testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year.

Let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up. President Trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call -- not the July 25th a phone call that we've already seen but an earlier phone call in April just after President Zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents.

What value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation?

MALONEY: Well, I don't know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president. If the president wants to release it, that's fine. I don't think it's relevant to this investigation.

WALLACE: Let's turn to the public hearings this week. You've got three witnesses testifying, we've already seen the transcripts of their interviews. People know what they're going to say.

Is the argument that you're basically -- people are going to read the book but they're going to see the movie? Because that didn't work out very well in the Robert Mueller testimony.

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, the point is that the Republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony. So, you know, they should take yes for an answer. I think it's very important that the public be able to judge for itself.

And I really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings. Read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds. You won't have any filter. You won't have the press or politicians in the way. You'll have witnesses giving opening statements.

And these are military veterans. These are career nonpartisan civil servants. The first witness, Ambassador Bill Taylor --

(CROSSTALK)

MALONEY: Excuse me, is an appointee of a Republican president who serve this country in the military. I think we should give him a chance.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Sir, you've already made that point and I would like to get -- I'm running out of time, I'd like to get one last question in if I might.

Here's what President Trump says about all those witnesses. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any first-hand knowledge, there is no firsthand knowledge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: The president does have a point. None of these officials actually talked to the president.

When we think back to John Dean with Richard Nixon, he took us into the Oval Office. He told what he told the president and what the president told him.

As the president says, all of the information we're going to hear this week is secondhand. Is that enough to impeach a president?

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, if you're talking about this week -- but, of course, there witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, who spoke directly to the president. There are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate.

By the way, the State Department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence, but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president's phone call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong, what he heard. That's a military veteran.

There are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it's -- honestly, if I can say, it is heartbreaking to hear the president, any American president, deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information. It's also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any American president would engage in misconduct. You know, it gives me no pleasure to tell you the American president has abused his office and he should be accountable.

WALLACE: Well, as you say, people are going to get to see for themselves this week.

Congressman Maloney, thank you, thanks for joining us. And, of course, FOX News will cover the hearings this week live.

MALONEY: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Democratic front runner Joe Biden reacts to Michael Bloomberg looking at a run for the White House.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how a Bloomberg campaign would shake up the Democratic race. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: As we are more testimony, in fact the testimony that we're hearing today, it's actually getting easier to defend the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Republican Congressman Mark Meadows setting very different expectations for this week's public impeachment hearings.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes.

Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you.

What do you expect these public hearings to accomplish? We know what these witnesses are going to say. They -- we -- they -- their opening statements were leaked. Their full hours long transcripts have been -- have been put out there for anybody who's interested to read. They've been widely covered. It doesn't seem to have moved anybody. I mean the Democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn't seem to have been a single vote that's been swayed so far at least by House Republicans in favor of impeachment.

So what's the point?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD: Well, I mean, now it's time for the American people to see the evidence. I mean let's admit it, even -- I've read some of the transcripts but haven't read all of them and I think for the American people to be able to see these witnesses, to know their, you know, their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee, and I think that that will be really compelling.

And, you know, maybe it's not about swaying individual members of Congress right now, but it's about making sure that the American people put it out there because Congress are followers, right? They'll follow the public. And I think that it's really important for the American people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the United States.

WALLACE: Karl, let's talk about the -- what we're going to hear in terms of the testimony this week. You worked in a White House. We're going to hear from three career foreign service officers. One of them, William Taylor, a military veteran, has served presidents since 1985. Ronald Reagan. They're going to talk about an off the books foreign policy. They're going to talk about an ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made, a campaign being run by Rudy Giuliani, allegedly. They're going to hear about a link between U.S. support for Ukraine and Ukraine conducting investigations of the president's political rivals.

Obviously there's another side to the story, but that story, does it bother you?

KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who served in the White House, it does bother me, yes. But, on the other hand, there is constant friction between the State Department and an administration. We saw this during the Iraq War, where we had the people in the State Department leaking against the administration's policy. But, look, that's going to be the sideshow.

The thing that's going to happen when we have this testimony is, is that the Republicans are going to be able to ask questions. Think about where we've been. We have selective leaks of what -- of what these people said, which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president. Then we have their entire transcripts, which most people don't read. Now we're going to have televised hearings in which they're going to be able to say their piece and it's going to have an impact, but there also going to be questioned. And the questioning is going to get to, you know, we have a quid. Military aid and assistance for Ukraine. And we have a quo. And that quo is, investigative the Bidens and any other American involved in corruption. But so far we don't have the pro, the for, that is to say that what we know today is, is that the Ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed. And we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate Joe Biden.

And we're -- and the failure of the Democrats -- Schiff's statement last night was very problematic because the American people are going to want to hear about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Devon Archer (ph) and this stinky situation involving Burisma. And if the Democrats say, we're not going to allow you to have those people called, it's just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt.

WALLACE: Mo.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Ambassador Sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the Ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this. So that's -- that's about where we are on that point.

Look, ultimately, I agree with the congresswoman, that now the American people get to see this stuff. And if you think about this politically and what actually -- you know, based on the very few precedents we have in American history on this, looking back on Richard Nixon, Republicans were with him. Republican voters were with him up until the very end. The day he left, the polling show that about 30 percent of Republicans thought he should be removed from office. But that 30 percent was a significant number because that's what put a lot of pressure on the Republican members of the Senate, when Barry Goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said, Mr. President, you know I've been your guy but it's become unsustainable for us. Right now you don't see that kind of breaking from Republican voters.

So the question becomes, do these hearings, as the congresswoman was saying, begin to mobilize and catalyze Republican voters? We know it's doing it for Democrats and we know it's doing it for independent voters.

WALLACE: But here's the question I have, and let me bring in Josh on this, because I understand that, you know, we pay much more attention to the leaks, we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do, but they are out there and they have been widely reported. They've been the lead on the evening news. They've been on the front page of the papers. And so far, Josh, it hasn't moved a single Republican vote.

JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Nor has it moved the Republican primary electorate. I mean I think, Mo, you have a good point there and what ultimately did in Nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him. If you look at the American people right now, in particular the Republican primary electorate, not only are they not moving away from the president, it's heartening. I mean you've got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote/unquote witch hunt.

So I -- look, we're a long way away from Republicans moving away from President Trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry. My guess is an open hearing in the House will only serve to exacerbate that. I don't think there's any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in.

WALLACE: I mean, that is the concern, I mean, that it hasn't moved the needle. And we've gotten a lot of information so far. I don't -- I mean I understand a TV -- well, I don't know if I understand because we -- everybody kept saying, you know, they won't read the book, they'll watch the movie and the Mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for Democrats, I think we would agree.

So let's assume that this is more effective than Robert Mueller as a -- as a witness. Does it really move the needle? Because it hasn't so far, congresswoman.

EDWARDS: Well, look, this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the Mueller report. I mean we have a president of the United States who withheld aid from an ally who was, you know, on the front lines against our chief adversary. And I think when the American people here that it wasn't -- this isn't about 2016, this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election. And I think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference.

I mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel, Vindman, for example, you know, he'll be there and he'll be in his dress blues and, you know, fully decorated, raising his hand saying that he's telling the truth.

I defy Republicans to challenge on that. They are not challenging on the substance, they are challenging on process, and that is a loser argument.

WALLACE: All right, you get the final word.

ROVE: Process matters, fairness matters, that's why Nixon went down because the process was fair. This is not fair. They won't allow the -- they've got allowed the president any of the rights granted to President Clinton during his impeachment, or any of the rights granted to President Nixon during his impeachment.

And I love the fact -- I love the fact that the Democrats are now decrying the president's decision not to move aid -- lethal aid rapidly to Ukraine. After all, the previous administration, a Democratic administration, did nothing to send lethal aid to Ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into Ukraine on C-130s because they didn't want U.S. military presence in Ukraine. So they drop them off in Poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to Ukraine.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: So this president at least had the guts to give the Ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the Russian attempts to subvert that country.

WALLACE: Well, I think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we're -- it will be a bipartisan game changer.

Panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 Democratic race. Can he win the nomination?

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a Bloomberg candidacy? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at “Fox News Sunday” and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: There's nobody I'd rather run against the little Michael.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Well, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both President Trump and Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders on a possible run for the White House.

And we're back now with the panel.

Mo, let me start with you.

Does Michael Bloomberg have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in, and it seems likely will, his plan, skip the first four, skip Iowa, skip New Hampshire, and basically begin your campaign on Super Tuesday in early March?

ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, it's an uphill climb, I would think, for -- for Mayor Bloomberg. And there's no evidence -- we've never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination. Not at least in the modern era. We've seen candidates who have tried to skip a state, skip Iowa and go straight to New Hampshire, skip New Hampshire and so to South Carolina --

WALLACE: Rudy Giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to Florida. That doesn't work out so well.

ELLEITHEE: Right, it just doesn't -- it doesn't work out so well.

But I think what Bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate's last line of defense against the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders wing of the party. That if Biden stumbles and is falling behind --

WALLACE: And right now he's in fourth place in Iowa and -- and not leading in New Hampshire either.

ELLEITHEE: And that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization. And those later states, to his credit, are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states. He's got the money to invest heavily in advertising, that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates' last line of defense. I think -- I'm a little skeptical that it works, but it is a strategy that, you know, that if Biden stumbles, it looks like he's going to, you know, try to put himself in position to execute.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that Michael Bloomberg will get into this race, we got this on Facebook from Brad Yates. He writes, how does Bloomberg's stance on corporations stand against the current Democrat party's push toward socialism?

Congressman Edwards, how do you answer Brad basically on the -- on the question, is he just way too far to the right for this current Democratic Party?

EDWARDS: Well, I think that -- I mean I think that's a reasonable question but, look, there's no push toward socialism in the Democratic Party. But I do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the -- a Michael Bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center. And the question of, are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent, the bottom 60 percent of Americans? And I think that's a legitimate debate for Democrats to have. We've been having that in our -- within our party.

WALLACE: How about the argument that billionaires like Bill Gates, like Michael Bloomberg, create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that's actually what kind of feeds the bulldog?

EDWARDS: Absolutely they do and I worked for a corporation early in my career and I think that that is important.

But the question is, how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other Americans can aspire to their highest dreams too? Creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other Americans. I think that is a front and center debate of the Democratic Party and I think Michael Bloomberg's candidacy puts it right there in the middle.

And, you know, I'm looking forward to the debate because I think we've been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it's going to be important for any Democrat who wins in the Democratic primary to be able to unite the party. And I'm really not sure that a Michael Bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the Democratic Party.

WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the elections that were held this last Tuesday night, which were very interesting, where Democrats took control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears, although the Republican governor of Kentucky still won't concede, it appears that the Democrats have won the governor's seat in Kentucky.

President Trump talked in Kentucky, campaigning for the Republican governor the night before. Here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You've got to vote, because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: So, Karl, how worried should the president and Republicans be, not so much about those specific results and those specific races, but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here, the suburbs. The suburbs in Virginia. The suburbs in Kentucky. The suburbs in Pennsylvania, around Philadelphia, this continuing move away from a Republican Party to the Democrats?

ROVE: Yes, and, look, all suburbs are not the same. You mentioned Kentucky. In Kentucky you had a very --

WALLACE: You brought your whiteboard?

ROVE: I brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the governor's race, the Republican got 48.8 percent of the vote. Right below him on the ballot is a fresh first-time candidate, African-American Republican candidate for attorney general, who gets 57.8 percent of the vote and 75,000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot, runs nine points ahead of him. The rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer --

WALLACE: My goodness, this is Kentucky. It's a pretty red state.

ROVE: I understand. I understand. But the point is, is that in the suburbs, those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the Republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the Republicans take all those down ballot offices, which says, if you've got good candidates who make an appeal, they can carry the Republican suburbs.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: But, warning, negative, southeast Pennsylvania, Montgomery Bucks (ph), Delaware and Chester, Republican strongholds. The Democrats took Delaware County for the first time. The county council is 5-0 Democrat. First time they've had a majority on the county council since the civil war.

And then in Virginia, we've known about northern Virginia fading away from the Republicans. In this election it was the Richmond suburbs of Henrico (ph) and Chesterfields (ph). The Republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and Kentucky says if you right -- run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of Democrat, you can win. But (INAUDIBLE) a problem.

WALLACE: I want to -- I want to bring Josh in.

There's the continuing fallout from Elizabeth Warren's continuing plans, spending, taxing trillions of dollars. And there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: When you say I should pay a hundred billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I don't like vilifying anybody. I -- you know, I think we should applaud successful people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Josh, Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of JP Morgan, are certainly rich, but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. What does that say to you? I mean, obviously, they're two billionaires who are -- I guess Dimon's not a billionaire, but two rich guys. What does that say to you about their problems that Elizabeth Warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election?

HOLMES: I think the best sign that Elizabeth Warren has a real problem with sort of your center left Democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about Michael Bloomberg. I mean Michael Bloomberg said back in February that as long as Joe Biden is in this race and feels like he's got a comfortable hold on the nomination, he's not interested in running. But if the Democratic Party looks like it's auguring towards nominating somebody who's in that sort of left wing, sort of more extreme category --

WALLACE: But we should point out Michael Bloomberg's another billionaire.

HOLMES: Sure. Absolutely.

But here's the -- here's the point. The point is, is that Joe -- this all says a lot more about Joe Biden then it says about anything else. Joe Biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the Democratic primary electorate and the Democratic primary electorate is looking for an Elizabeth Warren. That's what -- you know, with all due respect to Bill Gates --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) Elizabeth Warren or --

HOLMES: No, no, with all -- with all due respect to Bill Gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the Democratic Party is, the Democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen, we like Elizabeth Warren. We like Bernie Sanders. We have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this -- in this primary electorate.

ELLEITHEE: You've got Biden and Buttigieg --

EDWARDS: Joe Biden --

ELLEITHEE: Are -- are doing about as well combined as Warren and Sanders are doing combined.

HOLMES: Well, he's -- look, he's lost --

ROVE: One's at seven and one's at 20.

ELLEITHEE: The moderates --

ROVE: And the other two are at 18 and 22.

ELLEITHEE: Not in Iowa. In Iowa those four are clustered very closely together.

Look, in 2018, more center left Democrats won congressional primaries than far left Democrats won congressional primaries with a primary (INAUDIBLE).

HOLMES: But it's not happening in the 2020 cycle. And I've got to tell you, people --

ROVE: There's a lot more far left Democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016.

ELLEITHEE: We'll see.

EDWARDS: This hasn't shaken out yet, so -- I mean it hasn't shaken out at all and everything's still (INAUDIBLE).

WALLACE: So the battle continues. Thank you all, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the dedication it takes to escort the nation's bravest to their final resting place.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: On this Veterans Day weekend, we want to introduce you to a special military unit whose mission is to pay final tribute to the men and women who have defended our freedom. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAPTAIN ZACKARY STEELMAN, U.S. ARMY OLD GUARD CAISSON PLATOON: It's our honor to be able to provide them the best ceremony that they deserve and that their families deserve, to just pay it back to them the way that they've paid it to us.

WALLACE: Captain Zackary Steelman is talking about the Old Guard Caisson Platoon that bears the casket for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.

Two teams go out, one with white horses, one with black. Each participating in as many as four funerals a day. But the platoon is determined every one will be special.

STEELMAN: That family isn't going to get a second funeral. We have to put as much effort and time into making sure every detail of what we do is the best we can make it.

Do what you've got to do.

WALLACE: A squad is up at 4:30 each morning to make sure it's perfect. The horses are sprayed till they glean. The tack is shined. And so is the caisson that carried a canon back in the First World War.

Then, the horses are hitched up. The lead team that takes the caisson through the cemetery, the swing team that gets around tight corners, and the wheel team that acts as breaks. Then, they call out the mission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attention to orders! Zero nine, grant (ph) the 12 alpha, colonel, United States Air Force.

Swing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lead?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wheel?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caisson forward! Out (ph)!

WALLACE (on camera): Why do you have to do all of that?

STEELMAN: Well, it's not that we have to do any of those things, sir, it's really that we get to do those things. We're about to perform a funeral and we're about to perform the mission for that family and we want to make sure that we're doing it to the absolute best ability that we have for them.

WALLACE (voice over): The caisson platoon is part of presidential funerals. A riderless horse named Black Jack was in John Kennedy's procession. When he stepped on his handlers toe, the soldier kept marching.

In 2004, the military honors were for Ronald Reagan. The riderless horse was named Sergeant York, he is still part of the platoon.

STEELMAN: Sergeant York is the oldest horse that we have here in the barn. He's actually 29.

WALLACE (on camera): Twenty-nine?

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: Reagan used to say that there's nothing as good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: He would have loved this one.

WALLACE (voice over): Captain Steelman signed up for the Army's armor branch. When he joined the caisson platoon, he had never been on a horse. Now he thinks it's as important as any other mission.

WALLACE (on camera): How long do you want to keep being in the caisson platoon.

STEELMAN: If I could, sir, I'd be here for the rest of my life. I absolutely love this job.

I get to see soldiers every single day put in a lot of hard work for someone they really don't even know. I'm honored to be able to bring them to their final resting place. And it's just an honor to be a part of that specific mission.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Horses in the caisson platoon are put up for adoption after the service is complete. And right now Elvira, a member of the swing team for 16 years, is available. If you want to find out more, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And before we go, here's a live look at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our colleagues at Fox NFL Sunday there for a special Veterans Day broadcast as a salute to the troops.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, in an interview with CBS, doubled down on his retort against Elizabeth Warren.

""I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things,"" Dimon said.

Dimon, who is worth about $1.6 billion, was also quizzed on his $31 million salary, saying it wasn't up to him.

View Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, in an interview with CBS doubled down on his retort against Elizabeth Warren.

Dimon, who is worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, spoke with CBS's Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"", where he touched on the causes of the 2008 financial crash, the American economy and cancer survival.

Stahl asked Dimon: ""So Elizabeth Warren said in Iowa the other day, 'Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful,' and you jumped in and said this week about her that she was 'vilifying successful people and having harsh words for Wall Street bankers.'""

Dimon responded: ""Most people are good, not all of 'em,"" adding, ""I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things. And so my comment is, I think it's American society – we're just attacking each other all the time.""

Dimon, who has been at the helm of America's biggest bank since 2005, has publicly spatted with Warren about the topic of billionaires, with the CEO saying in the past: ""She uses some pretty harsh words — some would say vilifies successful people. We should applaud successful people.""

In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, which aired on Sunday, Dimon also criticized Trump's tax cuts — despite the policy boosting JPMorgan profits $3.7 billion. JPMorgan has crushed earnings targets this year, with the last quarter results boasting a record level of revenue.

""I would not have cut the tax on the rich. I would've extended the Earned Income Tax Credit instead – which is like a negative income tax credit for lower-paid people,"" said Dimon in the interview.

He added: ""We probably should change the minimum wage, which I don't think has been changed for like 10 or 15 years. There are solutions to these problems. The problems are real. It does not mean Free Enterprise is bad.""

Dimon was also quizzed on his pay by Stahl in the heated exchange below:

Lesley Stahl: ""Let's talk about the wage gap in this country between the rich and almost everybody else. How much of a problem do you see that?""

Jamie Dimon: ""I think it's a huge problem and I think the wealthy have been getting wealthier too much, in many ways. So middle-class incomes have been kinda flat for maybe 15 years or so. And that's not particularly good in America. But in particular, at the low end, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less. They've particularly been left behind.""

Lesley Stahl: ""You're talking about people who earn very little money. Listen to this statistic. Compensation for executives, CEOs, grew 940%, 940%, in the last 40 years. Your average worker, so middle class, middle class, grew 12%.""

Jamie Dimon: ""We haven't done a good job growing our economy. And that would fix a lot of that problem.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Executive pay: Last year you were paid $31 million. Too high?""

Jamie Dimon: ""The board sets mine. I have nothing to do with it.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Well, you could return some of it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. Is that gonna solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""I don't know.""

Jamie Dimon: ""Is it going to solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""No but you could set an example and say, ""I'm not going to take all that money. I don't need it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. I'm going to leave it to the board to set my comp. Not you, not the press--""

Lesley Stahl: ""You've answered every one of my questions but this one you're fobbing off.'

Jamie Dimon: ""Yeah, the board has to do it.""

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President… [+4411 chars]","To ask ""the American people"" to decide the proper resolution of the Ukraine scandal is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months.",2019-11-11,MSNBC,Why the question of Trump's impeachment can't wait for Election Day,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-the-question-trumps-impeachment-cant-wait-election-day,"About a month ago, at the start of the most recent Democratic presidential primary debate, CNN’s Anderson Cooper began the event by posing a familiar question to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): “You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?”

In a new interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, made a related argument:

“I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?”

Those familiar with American Civics 101 probably realize the reason “a bunch of people in Congress” are working on an impeachment inquiry is because that’s how the process is supposed to work under the U.S. Constitution. What’s more, we have “a bunch of people in Congress” grappling with how to address presidential abuses because “the American people” decided to put the House of Representatives in the hands of a Democratic majority – made up of members who ran on a platform of holding Trump accountable.

I’m going to assume that Haley, a former top member of Donald Trump’s team, knows all of this. I’ll also assume that the point she intended to make was about delaying judgment on the president’s apparent misconduct until Election Day 2020. Indeed, the former South Carolina governor added on Twitter over the weekend, “This is a decision for the American people.”

It’s an increasingly popular pitch in GOP circles. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who’ll retire from elected office next year, recently argued, “An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president.” Similarly, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, added yesterday, “Let the American people decide this in less than a year.”

At face value, this may seem like one of the GOP’s less ridiculous arguments. Trump was caught crossing the line, and if voters have a problem with the president’s abuses, they can vote for someone new next November. If, on the other hand, voters are unmoved, the electorate can make that clear, too.

There are, however, a couple of serious flaws with this.

NBC News’ First Read team published an item in September about the Ukraine scandal, just as it was starting to break, that stuck with me:

If this is what this looks like … then it’s arguably worse than Watergate, when the dirty tricks were being conducted by Americans against Americans. But this time, is the dirty trick a sitting president dangling aid to a foreign country to get it to investigate a rival campaign? We learned from 2016 that the Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. Do national Democrats – who believe defeating Trump in 2020, not impeaching him, is the best way to remove him from office – understand what else we might see over the next 14 months?

The Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. That, in a nutshell, is why the scandal can’t wait. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

As New York’s Jon Chait recently put it, “Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump’s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.”

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind."

Here's why,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-elizabeth-warren-wall-street-big-tech-enemies,"One thing we know for sure about Elizabeth Warren, above all else, is that on economic questions, she's a sincere populist. Warren is deeply distressed by income inequality. She profoundly distrusts Wall Street and Big Tech. She hates monopolies and massive multi-generational concentrations of wealth.

So if you're a private equity chieftain, for example, or a weed-smoking ""trustafarian"" living off family money in Jackson Hole, you've got to be terrified of Elizabeth Warren.

How could you not be terrified? Listen to her talk:

BIDEN EDGES RIVALS, BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP TIER IN NEW NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, R-Mass. and 2020 presidential candidate: Now they've got their fortunes and their money managers and their PR ...

And they're getting richer, faster and faster and faster, and everybody else is getting left behind.

The wealth tax -- the two-cent wealth tax. God, I love that wealth tax, right?

I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

""Oh, it's time to fight back against the monopolists who dominate our economy!"" Sound familiar? Actually, that's not too far from what Donald Trump ran on in 2016, back before Paul Ryan and the Ayn Rand people got ahold of his economic program.

But this time around, Elizabeth Warren plans to steal that message -- the Trump message really. Warren claims that she is the radical populist here. She is the disruptor.

But is she? Let's see.

Emily Tisch Sussman is a woke liberal who often appears in cable television to talk about Democratic politics. Nice person, but she is the daughter of two billionaires. So you'd think that Emily Tisch Sussman would hate Elizabeth Warren.

But she doesn't. Instead, she demands that you support Elizabeth Warren. or else you're sexist. Here's what she said recently:

Emily Tisch Sussman, Democratic activist: I actually heard -- overheard -- someone saying what I thought was an interesting point: That basically at this point, if you are still supporting [Bernie] Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved.

I thought it was an interesting point. And I think there may be something to it.

Yes, there might be something to it. If you don't support Warren, you're a sexist!

Now, keep in mind, you just saw one of the richest people on Planet Earth demanding that you support Elizabeth Warren for president. Surprising, right?

Elizabeth Warren is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

Well, actually, it turns out that some of Warren's most fervent supporters are the very people she claims she wants to fight. Well, that's weird.

So, for example, in the third quarter of this year, Elizabeth Warren raised more money from Silicon Valley, from those ""monopolists"" she claims to hate, than anybody else running for president.

Spotify's CEO is an Elizabeth Warren fan; so is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire Chris Sacca. He has already maxed out to her campaign. Really? The billionaires supporting her?

Then last month, Charlie Gasparino over on Fox Business reported that Elizabeth Warren's campaign is making overtures to finance moguls on Wall Street seeking contributions -- and some of them are responding.

But wait a second. Why would Elizabeth Warren's enemies -- and these have got to be her enemies, she attacks them all the time on the campaign trail -- why would her enemies fund her campaign?

We will give you five seconds to think about it, but the answer, of course, is they're not really her enemies. They understand that Warren doesn't really mean what she says. They know that Warren's populism is a facade and underneath it all, she is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

That's what it seems like she really is.

Is she?

* After nearly three decades on Capitol Hill, 75-year-old Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) announced this morning that he’ll retire at the end of this Congress. King’s Long Island district is considered competitive and will likely be a key 2020 congressional battleground.

* On a related note, Bevin hasn’t been able to substantiate his allegations of voting “irregularities,” but his allies are assisting in the search for “suspicious activity or voter fraud.”

* There was one unresolved state House race in Virginia, which Democrat Nancy Guy appears to have won. As a result, the Democratic majority in the House of Delegates will be 55-45.

* On a related note, this summarized recent electoral developments in Virginia nicely: “A GOP candidate hasn’t won statewide office in Virginia since 2009. On Tuesday, Democrats gained majorities in both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation; the House of Delegates swung from a 66-34 Republican edge in 2017 to a 55-45 Democratic advantage for next year’s session.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., put America's billionaires front-and-center on the campaign trail last week and mocked those speaking out against her proposed wealth tax.

""Boy, there are some billionaires who don't like this,"" Warren said Friday in Goose Creek, South Carolina. ""I think I hurt someone's feelings... This is sad. So... people are saying, 'Oh, I'm just mean to the billionaires.""

Among those speaking out against Warren's proposals last week were Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon even suggested Warren may have been vilifying ""successful people.""

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Stephen Moore, a former senior economic adviser to President Trump and a distinguished visiting fellow for the Heritage Foundation's Project for Economic Growth, took on Warren's case against America's wealthiest.

""The vast majority of people in the top 1 percent... [t]hey own, operate or invest in small businesses,"" Moore said. ""They are the job creators and the wealth creators of our economy.""

""Look at what Bill Gates and a person like Jeff Bezos have done,"" Moore added. ""They've created hundreds and thousands of jobs. They've created... higher incomes... I hate this bashing of the rich.""

Moore argued that policymakers should be more focused on growing the economy than redistributing the wealth of some Americans through higher taxes.

""What I care about is -- as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan used to say -- let's create a rising tide that lifts all boats. And, I think under Trump, that's what's happening. You know, we're seeing all income groups benefit from this expansion,"" he said.

John Grace, the founder and president of Investors Advantage Corp., argued that the growing disparity between the wealth of Americans needed to be addressed.

""I think it's worth noting in 1962, when we look at the top 1 percent versus the bottom 99 percent, at that point, it was pretty equal, 30 to 34 percent was the share of wealth,"" Grace said. ""By 2016, the top 1 percent is garnering over 40 percent of the wealth and the bottom 90 percent is generating a whopping 20 percent of the wealth. So, one has dramatically increased.""

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

In conclusion, Moore said he saw Warren's proposals as more punitive than productive.

""My friend, [economist] Art Laffer, says, 'You want a tax system that tries to make poor people rich, not make rich people poor.' Sometimes I think some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have that wrong,"" he said.

""There are certain problems out there. But... all I'm hearing from the Democrats right now is, sock it to the rich and give it to the poor... Income redistribution is not an economic growth plan,"" Moore concluded.

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

After panderfest forums, boring speeches and inconclusive debates, many Dems now sound like Peggy Lee as they ask, “Is that all there is?”

While most remain wildly enthusiastic about defeating Trump, they are far from ready to unite behind a single candidate. Even worse, the ideological split in the party is so serious that it might not be healed before Election Day.

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

BLOOMBERG'S BARRIERS TO RUNNING AND WINNING THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Nov. 7-11, with 451 Iowa voters likely to take part in the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

Guy Benson: It's Tuesday, November 12, 2019. Welcome to The Guy Bensons show. I'm Guy Benson live in Washington, D.C., coming to you coast to coast. Always appreciate you being here. Guy Benson, Show Dot.com is our Web site. We've got a big lineup for you on this Tuesday. Eli Lake will be here, Juan Williams as well. Oh, some news about my alma mater, Northwestern, not making me happy. A big embarrassing scandal at the journalism school or at least a student newspaper. I will address all of that coming up. But we begin today's show with a first time guest. We are pleased to welcome Senator John Cornyn, senior senator from the great state of Texas, a Republican. He serves on the Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee, the Intelligence Committee. He's also seeking reelection next year. Senator, thanks for being here.

Sen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Good to be with you.

Guy Benson: Well, I have to ask you, the biggest news of the day, at least here in Washington, people are anticipating tomorrow the kickoff of open hearings, public hearings in the impeachment process over on the other side of Capitol Hill. As you take a look at this process unfolding from down the hall in the Senate, what would it, in your view, a fair process look like in the House? And if they move forward with impeachment, which I think they probably will. What would a fair trial process look like in the Senate?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, unfortunately, Guy, Nancy Pelosi knew that if you produced a partisan articles of impeachment, that it would taint, taint this whole process in the eyes of the American people and be unsuccessful in the Senate, where it requires two thirds of the Senate to vote, to convict and remove. And fortunately, I don't think there's anything they can do at this point to restore the impression that this is a fair and fair process. I think finally, after Adam Schiff has been interviewing people behind closed doors and then selectively leaking information that supports their narrative, finally they're going to open it to the public. But I don't think anybody should be under the illusion that this is is a fair process, by the way. This is would be the fourth time in American history where this process has been started and none of them have resulted in the forced removal of a president. Obviously, President Clinton resigned. Excuse me. Nixon resigned. Clinton was not removed. And so during this one year before the next election, and basically eliminating the possibility of doing anything else constructive during this time period strikes me as is is a futile act.

Guy Benson: I mean, I struggle to envision a scenario where the Democrats don't impeach the president, the president, and kick it over to the upper chamber. If that happens, if and when that happens, do you think the process of a trial would look at least somewhat similar to what we saw in the late 90s with Bill Clinton?

Sen. Cornyn: Yes. I think what happened then is Tom Daschle and Trent Lott negotiated essentially a standing order or a process by which the evidence was presented by the impeachment managers. And then the president's lawyers got to respond, which lasted basically five weeks. But this is going to be kind of an out of body experience, I think, for most Americans watching senators sit there, not being able to speak with the chief justice presiding over this partisan enterprise. I just why would call the call the Senate, the jury here. Ordinarily, you would think of a jury as being disinterested and impartial. But obviously, this is a partisan process from start to finish. It's not going to work. And unfortunately, with Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are going to further divide the country with no nothing really to show for it in the end.

Guy Benson: No, Senator, I can imagine some of your colleagues in the Senate who are running for president. I think it might be very difficult for them to sit there speechless, literally not able to talk. Given the political season that we are all in. Last question on this. You're on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. Talk about the distinction, because over in the House now, for years it has been extremely partisan, extremely acrimonious in the House Intelligence Committee. But that really hasn't been the case in the Senate with Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner. It seems like it's been a lot more collegial and professional and serious. Why?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I appreciate you saying that. I think it's because I think we all see the the benefit to the Senate as an institution into the country and the intelligence community for us to try not to let this the important work that we do fall victim to partisan wrangling. I don't think this is covered the House with glory even under the previous when Republicans were in the majority. Unfortunately. The house is a little more rambunctious than the upper chamber, sometimes referred to as the House of Lords, but are. But that's something we work very hard to try to do throughout a very difficult investigation over the Russian Russian act. The active measures during the 2016 campaign and beyond. We haven't always succeeded, but we've certainly tried.

Guy Benson: Senator, you represent Texas, a huge border state. I'm wondering your reaction to some of the really extraordinary violence that we've seen south of the border in recent days, including one of the major cartels effectively defeating Mexican forces in a battle and being forced to release drug kingpins son from custody and then this really horrific massacre of American citizens. That has to be something of concern. And I think it underscores when when people talk about border security, it's not just a political talking point. There are some very dangerous realities in a country that is sitting. Exactly. You know, due south of your state.

Sen. Cornyn: Exactly. Well, obviously, under Lopez Obrador, he essentially as waved a white flag when it comes to taking on the cartels. And they are very big and powerful and well-armed and they are wealthy and well organized. And they their tentacles reach into all aspects of Mexican life, including the government. And it is a growing concern. Ordinarily, the cartels would not and would not try to attack Americans because they would realize that would raise the visibility of their activities in a way that would get some unwanted attention. But right now, Mexico controls a little more than half of their landmass. Almost half of their landmass is controlled by the cartels, including all the region adjacent to the U.S. Mexico border. We can't ignore this because we are we we're for better or for worse, joined together by that common border. And our economies are are very dependent on one another. But I think we're all trying to figure out what comes next. Because we can't allow Americans to be targeted in Mexico and just have us do nothing in response. So we're trying to figure that one out right now. But this really raises the whole concern to a new level.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, another issue separately that you've been talking about quite a lot recently involves drug prices, which is not necessarily a sexy topic for talk radio, where everyone gets heated and passionate, but it's a pocketbook issue that matters to millions of people, especially senior citizens. And you seem to be frustrated at the moment because there's a bipartisan bill that's way late, at least for now. Talk about the bill and what's happening.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, this is once something that I thought that the administration was interested in tackling. Certainly Republicans and Democrats see this as a pocketbook issue. And we're hearing a lot from our constituents about their high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. We did pass a bill unanimously through the Judiciary Committee has to do with patent patent thickets. It's called where drug companies will file tens, sometimes more than 100 individual patents and in a way to discourage any generic competition. For example, there's a drug humerus, which is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. And it's a wonder drug. But the company who patented it has more than 120 separate patents on the same molecule. And in Europe, there are four competitors in place. So obviously we need more competition and to bring down prices and produce more affordable medications for our people. And it's a it's something I'm afraid is falling quickly, falling the casualty to impeachment mania. But in this specific instance, I've gone to the floor with Richard Blumenthal, my Democratic colleague from Connecticut, and it's been blocked by Senator Schumer. We're going to be back again this week to try to have some political accountability for blocking this common sense bill.

Guy Benson: What is his justification for blocking it?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think because he can and because he doesn't want Republicans to get any credit for anything positive in this area during an election cycle, election year coming up on an election. But I think we're going to try to smoke him out later this week. And in the end, I don't think you'll be able to sustain his position blocking it, because it's not it's not a partisan bill, but it is one that will actually lower drug costs for consumers. And I think that's a hard position to sustain.

Guy Benson: Senator, on that point, right, I'm all for choice and competition. I'm a. Capitalist I'm someone who believes in all of those fundamental values when it comes to an issue like the development of new miracle drugs. Right. I can understand if you bring in generic competitors, prices come down for the American people. I'm all for that. I'm in favor of that, of course. The counter argument that you sometimes hear from the pharmaceutical companies is it takes and this is true. It takes huge amounts of money to in research and development to innovate and create new drugs. And if they can't sort of get the benefit, the windfall from doing so, it disincentive Vice's research, development and innovation. What are the protections that these types of laws have to make sure that innovation isn't immediately sort of ripped off by competitors?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, you accurately described, I think, our intellectual property protection system under our under the Constitution that the you can patent something and you have exclusive rights to sell it for a period of time. The question is whether that time can be artificially extended by gamesmanship rather than by by the by the traditional patent protection period after which there is competition by generic generic competitors. And so they can recoup the costs of their research and development of these lifesaving drugs. We don't want to discourage innovation and we do want to protect intellectual property. But after a point there, it really becomes a matter of them maintaining their exclusive right to sell something by by artificially precluding that kind of competition, which we know in the end ultimately will benefit consumers and bring down prices, too.

Guy Benson: Senator, on health care, one of your colleagues running for president, Elizabeth Warren, has openly conceded. She has said that her single payer health care plan would make health care, private health care coverage illegal for 180 million people. She's openly considered that it would kill 2 million jobs. She has openly conceded that it would apply and be given by the taxpayers to illegal immigrants. She's she's admitting these things. And I wonder what you make of that. Not just on substance, but as a political matter.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, it's surreal to hear the here. After many years of arguing the Affordable Care Act was somehow the panacea that was going to solve all of our health care concerns. To hear Elizabeth Warren and other other radicals in her party say that's not good enough anymore, we want to take full control over your health care choices. And it will have the consequence that you just described, an incredible increase in costs and longer lines. By the way. And would would would destroy the private health insurance that 180 or so million people get from their employer. I think, you know, the Democrats have lost control of their party to their to their radical base. Nancy Pelosi has lost control of them and leading it to this ill, ill considered impeachment process, partisan impeachment process. But it looks like the base of the party is supporting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And these things like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, which are just completely unrealistic, will break break the bank and will concede more control to the federal government and less freedom for individuals to choose what they think is best for themselves and their families.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, last question briefly. Jeff Sessions announcing he wants his old job back. You served with him for a long time, a senator from Alabama. Your thoughts on him jumping back into the race, having served as attorney general for a while?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, Jeff Sessions is a friend of mine, and I did serve with him for a long time in the Senate before he became attorney general. Obviously, he got crosswise with the president when he recused himself from the from the investigation over the Russian activities. I believe he did had no choice but to do that under Department of Justice guidelines. I think he's he's conducted himself honorably to the best of his ability. He hadn't attacked the president, which I think is smart. And he's decided to go back and run and serve the people of Alabama. And I wish him well.

Guy Benson: Senator John Cornyn of Texas. We really appreciate your time. We'd love to have you back, sir.

Sen. Cornyn: I'd love to come back. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Guy Benson: We'll make that happen. And we'll take a quick break as we just get going. It's Tuesday. It's the Guy Benson Show. Don't go anywhere."
31,Associated Press,Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema… [+5426 chars],Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema…,2019-11-11,Fox News,Buttigieg backs female as VA secy as Dems release vet plans,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-backs-female-as-va-secy-as-dems-release-vet-plans,"Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping female vets.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."
32,Paul Steinhauser,"CONCORD, N.H. – Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer is far from thrilled that fellow billionaire Mike Bloomberg might enter the race for the party’s 2020 nomination.

After Steyer filed to place his name on the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot, the one-time hedge fund manager turned billionaire environmental and progressive advocate took a shot at Bloomberg while answering questions from reporters.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE LAUNCHES 2020 BID

""I’ve traveled around full time for seven years and listened, said Steyer, who created the influential grassroots advocacy organization NextGenAmerica in 2013 and who has been one of the leaders of the push to impeach President Trump. “I feel as if anyone who doesn’t do that kind of traveling and face to face talking to Americans and more than that, listening to Americans, I don’t know how you could really in good conscience run for president.""

“I feel as if, as a Democrat, I’ve said about Michael Bloomberg, if he can’t accept the idea of a wealth tax, if he doesn’t embrace it, he doesn’t understand that inequality is at the heart of the problems in America right now, then I don’t think he should run, because I don’t think he can represent the Democratic Party,"" Steyer added.

Steyer was in New Hampshire on the same day that Bloomberg filed to place his name on the ballot in Arkansas, hours ahead of that state’s presidential primary filing deadline. On Friday, Bloomberg’s name was placed on the primary ballot in Alabama an hour ahead of that state’s filing deadline.

SANDERS BLASTS BLOOMBERG

Bloomberg – the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor -- changed his voter registration to Democrat last year. He flirted with a presidential bid early this year but ruled out a run in March. His top advisers said last week that the media and business mogul changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 Democratic White House contenders were not “well positioned” to beat Trump next November.

Steyer announced in January that he wouldn’t run for president but later changed his mind. Since launching his campaign in July, he’s spent at least $47 million on his White House bid, mostly on TV commercials.

Asked by Fox News if he’ll spend another $47 million on his campaign, Steyer said “at the beginning of this campaign our staff estimated that we’d spend $100 million. Do I think that that was a good guess? I have no idea.”

He went on to emphasize the importance of this presidential election, saying “when people ask me ‘What are you willing to put into this? How much do you care?’ unlimited.”

Steyer – who is pulling in the mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders – noted that the race is “probably more open today than it was three months ago or six months ago ... It’s more unsettled today than when I started. I don’t think I’m going to be the last person to enter this race.”

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – a long-shot for the nomination - also filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, doing so a couple of hours before Steyer.

When asked about Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is also reportedly mulling a late entry into the Democratic race, Bullock emphasized that Democrats “have to win back places we lost. I think I can do it ... I don’t know that another coastal person running is going to make that much of a difference. Look, we already have one candidate from Massachusetts [Elizabeth Warren]. Do we need another? We already have one billionaire running [Steyer], do we need another?”"

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”



Pergram: The ‘impeachment resolution,’ and Dems' fight over its meaning - Fox News: “It didn’t matter what that resolution was called or wasn’t called a few weeks ago. Congress has descended into impeachapalooza. There’s no quibbling about what’s consuming Capitol Hill. Some Democrats may fret about the political ramifications of impeachment. Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat. … In her new post as fundraising director, Israel is taking on the daunting task of raising up to $70 million for next July's big event.”



SUPREME COURT DIVIDED OVER FUTURE OF DACA

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”



Widow Rep. Elijah Cummings announces campaign for husband's seat - Fox News: “The widow of late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on Monday that she will launch a campaign to win her husband’s seat as representative of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, initially told The Baltimore Sun that she would formally announce her campaign on Tuesday, nearly a month after her husband died of cancer on Oct. 17 at age 68. … In her first televised interview since her husband’s death, Rockeymoore Cummings said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show Monday evening that she and her husband decided about six months ago that she would be the best fit to carry on his legacy and vision for the Baltimore district.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts reiterated her strong support for the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

Warren, who was in New Hampshire Wednesday to file to place her name on the Granite State's presidential primary ballot, also took another shot at former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg, who’s taking steps towards jumping into the Democratic race.

And she told Fox News that a potential entry this week by former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick wouldn’t complicate her own White House bid.

FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Warren – one of the first Democratic White House hopefuls to call for Trump’s impeachment -- told reporters after filing that “I believe it is appropriate for this impeachment inquiry to go forward. I think it should have happened earlier, but we're here now. Let’s do it.”

When asked if she had been watching the testimony from the televised public hearing, Warren said: “I just haven’t been able to catch up with it. Fortunately, I will catch up tonight.”

If the Democratic-controlled House impeaches the president, the GOP-led Senate would then hold a trial which could lead to Trump’s removal from office. Such a trial would probably keep Warren and the other Senate Democrats running for president off the campaign trail during the weeks leading up to the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I have Constitutional responsibilities,"" Warren said. ""I took an oath of office, as did everyone in Congress and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. And if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren told Fox News that she hadn’t talked with Patrick in recent days and said “no” when asked if the fellow Massachusetts Democrat’s potential entry into the race would complicate her own campaign. When asked about Patrick's years working at investment firm Bain Capital, Warren answered “I’m not here to criticize other Democrats. I’m here to talk about why I’m running for president.”

Patrick is likely to announce his candidacy on Thursday by video or social media, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday. He would then travel to neighboring New Hampshire on Friday the last day for candidates to file to place their names on the primary ballot.

Patrick isn’t the only Democrat likely to launch a campaign at this late date in the primary cycle. Bloomberg has placed his name on the presidential primary ballots in Alabama and Arkansas in recent days as he moves closer to launching a White House run.

I believe that what our election should be about is grassroots. How you build something all across New Hampshire, all across the country, and that we really shouldn’t have elections that are about billionaires calling all the shots, whether they’re reaching into their pockets to fund their own elections or whether they’re counting on getting other people to run,"" said Warren, who’s been critical of Bloomberg in recent days.

“I’ve noticed that billionaires go on TV and cry,"" she added. ""Other billionaires encourage their billionaire buddies to jump into the race.""

Warren may have been referring to billionaire Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman, who lamented during an interview on CNBC last week that Trump is dividing and polarizing Americans while Warren is pushing “Idiocy.” Like many other billionaires, Cooperman has heavily criticized Warren’s proposed tax on the richest Americans, calling it a “bankrupt concept.”"

BIDEN EDGES RIVALS, BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP TIER IN NEW NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, R-Mass. and 2020 presidential candidate: Now they've got their fortunes and their money managers and their PR ...

And they're getting richer, faster and faster and faster, and everybody else is getting left behind.

The wealth tax -- the two-cent wealth tax. God, I love that wealth tax, right?

I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back.

""Oh, it's time to fight back against the monopolists who dominate our economy!"" Sound familiar? Actually, that's not too far from what Donald Trump ran on in 2016, back before Paul Ryan and the Ayn Rand people got ahold of his economic program.

But this time around, Elizabeth Warren plans to steal that message -- the Trump message really. Warren claims that she is the radical populist here. She is the disruptor.

But is she? Let's see.

Emily Tisch Sussman is a woke liberal who often appears in cable television to talk about Democratic politics. Nice person, but she is the daughter of two billionaires. So you'd think that Emily Tisch Sussman would hate Elizabeth Warren.

But she doesn't. Instead, she demands that you support Elizabeth Warren. or else you're sexist. Here's what she said recently:

Emily Tisch Sussman, Democratic activist: I actually heard -- overheard -- someone saying what I thought was an interesting point: That basically at this point, if you are still supporting [Bernie] Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved.

I thought it was an interesting point. And I think there may be something to it.

Yes, there might be something to it. If you don't support Warren, you're a sexist!

Now, keep in mind, you just saw one of the richest people on Planet Earth demanding that you support Elizabeth Warren for president. Surprising, right?

Elizabeth Warren is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

Well, actually, it turns out that some of Warren's most fervent supporters are the very people she claims she wants to fight. Well, that's weird.

So, for example, in the third quarter of this year, Elizabeth Warren raised more money from Silicon Valley, from those ""monopolists"" she claims to hate, than anybody else running for president.

Spotify's CEO is an Elizabeth Warren fan; so is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire Chris Sacca. He has already maxed out to her campaign. Really? The billionaires supporting her?

Then last month, Charlie Gasparino over on Fox Business reported that Elizabeth Warren's campaign is making overtures to finance moguls on Wall Street seeking contributions -- and some of them are responding.

But wait a second. Why would Elizabeth Warren's enemies -- and these have got to be her enemies, she attacks them all the time on the campaign trail -- why would her enemies fund her campaign?

We will give you five seconds to think about it, but the answer, of course, is they're not really her enemies. They understand that Warren doesn't really mean what she says. They know that Warren's populism is a facade and underneath it all, she is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

That's what it seems like she really is.

Is she?

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

It's as old as hate',https://www.foxnews.com/media/mike-rowe-elizabeth-warren-billionaires-wealth-tax,"There is no mystery behind escalating criticism of American's wealthiest citizens during the 2020 presidential campaign, said TV host and actor Mike Rowe.

""It's not a new thing. It's as old as hate. You know, the trick is we just got to figure out who we hate this week,"" argued Rowe on Fox Nation's ""Reality Check with David Webb.""

In September, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted, ""Billionaires should not exist."" Fellow 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was accused by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon of ""vilifying successful people"" and Warren has been cheered on the campaign trail for mocking billionaires' objections to her proposals.

""Who can we blame? That's the game,"" Rowe told Fox Nation host David Webb.

""This country has been successful because ... it was business and industry and expansion, whether in agriculture and technology, hard work, you know, people taking risk,"" observed Webb, saying that many in the media appear to be stoking Americans' ""envy"" of their fellow countrymen.

""For me, you know, it's even more human,"" continued Rowe. ""I think on some level, we wind up resenting everything we rely on. It's only a matter of time. But if you walk resentment back, it almost always comes from some kind of dependency.""

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" host said that the recent planned power outrages in California provided an example of resentment in action.

""Last week, I was without power for four days and a lot of my neighbors realized all of a sudden, 'Wait a second, nothing works.'"" he recalled. ""That makes people very angry. And they don't know who to blame. So they flip off the linemen. You know, they blame PG&E. They blame the politicians. They blame everything.""

""But deep down, what's really going on is they just got a reminder that they utterly rely on a little plastic switch and the miracle that happens when they flip it and they're not in control of any of that. They don't have a generator. They don't have the means to fix the problem,"" said Rowe, suggesting that resentment is being turned on the wealthy by those who believe that the economic system is not working for them.

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

Rowe suggested that Americans must empower themselves by re-evaluating the definition of a good job in America. He started the ""Mike Rowe Works Foundation,"" which educates people about, ""millions of 'shovel ready' jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.""

""We've got over 7 million jobs in this country... that we need to fill,"" observed Webb. ""And in order to fill those jobs, we've got to get people through the right education.""

""Look on 'Dirty Jobs,' I failed in this area. I could have done a better job,"" admitted Rowe. ""But of the 300 people we featured, 40 were multimillionaires. Nobody knows it because they were covered in crap because they were crawling through a sewer or working in a septic tank. We don't associate optically any level of success with somebody who's covered in filth... reminding people of that is important,"" he concluded.

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

BLOOMBERG'S BARRIERS TO RUNNING AND WINNING THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Nov. 7-11, with 451 Iowa voters likely to take part in the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

Guy Benson: It's Tuesday, November 12, 2019. Welcome to The Guy Bensons show. I'm Guy Benson live in Washington, D.C., coming to you coast to coast. Always appreciate you being here. Guy Benson, Show Dot.com is our Web site. We've got a big lineup for you on this Tuesday. Eli Lake will be here, Juan Williams as well. Oh, some news about my alma mater, Northwestern, not making me happy. A big embarrassing scandal at the journalism school or at least a student newspaper. I will address all of that coming up. But we begin today's show with a first time guest. We are pleased to welcome Senator John Cornyn, senior senator from the great state of Texas, a Republican. He serves on the Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee, the Intelligence Committee. He's also seeking reelection next year. Senator, thanks for being here.

Sen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Good to be with you.

Guy Benson: Well, I have to ask you, the biggest news of the day, at least here in Washington, people are anticipating tomorrow the kickoff of open hearings, public hearings in the impeachment process over on the other side of Capitol Hill. As you take a look at this process unfolding from down the hall in the Senate, what would it, in your view, a fair process look like in the House? And if they move forward with impeachment, which I think they probably will. What would a fair trial process look like in the Senate?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, unfortunately, Guy, Nancy Pelosi knew that if you produced a partisan articles of impeachment, that it would taint, taint this whole process in the eyes of the American people and be unsuccessful in the Senate, where it requires two thirds of the Senate to vote, to convict and remove. And fortunately, I don't think there's anything they can do at this point to restore the impression that this is a fair and fair process. I think finally, after Adam Schiff has been interviewing people behind closed doors and then selectively leaking information that supports their narrative, finally they're going to open it to the public. But I don't think anybody should be under the illusion that this is is a fair process, by the way. This is would be the fourth time in American history where this process has been started and none of them have resulted in the forced removal of a president. Obviously, President Clinton resigned. Excuse me. Nixon resigned. Clinton was not removed. And so during this one year before the next election, and basically eliminating the possibility of doing anything else constructive during this time period strikes me as is is a futile act.

Guy Benson: I mean, I struggle to envision a scenario where the Democrats don't impeach the president, the president, and kick it over to the upper chamber. If that happens, if and when that happens, do you think the process of a trial would look at least somewhat similar to what we saw in the late 90s with Bill Clinton?

Sen. Cornyn: Yes. I think what happened then is Tom Daschle and Trent Lott negotiated essentially a standing order or a process by which the evidence was presented by the impeachment managers. And then the president's lawyers got to respond, which lasted basically five weeks. But this is going to be kind of an out of body experience, I think, for most Americans watching senators sit there, not being able to speak with the chief justice presiding over this partisan enterprise. I just why would call the call the Senate, the jury here. Ordinarily, you would think of a jury as being disinterested and impartial. But obviously, this is a partisan process from start to finish. It's not going to work. And unfortunately, with Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are going to further divide the country with no nothing really to show for it in the end.

Guy Benson: No, Senator, I can imagine some of your colleagues in the Senate who are running for president. I think it might be very difficult for them to sit there speechless, literally not able to talk. Given the political season that we are all in. Last question on this. You're on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. Talk about the distinction, because over in the House now, for years it has been extremely partisan, extremely acrimonious in the House Intelligence Committee. But that really hasn't been the case in the Senate with Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner. It seems like it's been a lot more collegial and professional and serious. Why?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I appreciate you saying that. I think it's because I think we all see the the benefit to the Senate as an institution into the country and the intelligence community for us to try not to let this the important work that we do fall victim to partisan wrangling. I don't think this is covered the House with glory even under the previous when Republicans were in the majority. Unfortunately. The house is a little more rambunctious than the upper chamber, sometimes referred to as the House of Lords, but are. But that's something we work very hard to try to do throughout a very difficult investigation over the Russian Russian act. The active measures during the 2016 campaign and beyond. We haven't always succeeded, but we've certainly tried.

Guy Benson: Senator, you represent Texas, a huge border state. I'm wondering your reaction to some of the really extraordinary violence that we've seen south of the border in recent days, including one of the major cartels effectively defeating Mexican forces in a battle and being forced to release drug kingpins son from custody and then this really horrific massacre of American citizens. That has to be something of concern. And I think it underscores when when people talk about border security, it's not just a political talking point. There are some very dangerous realities in a country that is sitting. Exactly. You know, due south of your state.

Sen. Cornyn: Exactly. Well, obviously, under Lopez Obrador, he essentially as waved a white flag when it comes to taking on the cartels. And they are very big and powerful and well-armed and they are wealthy and well organized. And they their tentacles reach into all aspects of Mexican life, including the government. And it is a growing concern. Ordinarily, the cartels would not and would not try to attack Americans because they would realize that would raise the visibility of their activities in a way that would get some unwanted attention. But right now, Mexico controls a little more than half of their landmass. Almost half of their landmass is controlled by the cartels, including all the region adjacent to the U.S. Mexico border. We can't ignore this because we are we we're for better or for worse, joined together by that common border. And our economies are are very dependent on one another. But I think we're all trying to figure out what comes next. Because we can't allow Americans to be targeted in Mexico and just have us do nothing in response. So we're trying to figure that one out right now. But this really raises the whole concern to a new level.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, another issue separately that you've been talking about quite a lot recently involves drug prices, which is not necessarily a sexy topic for talk radio, where everyone gets heated and passionate, but it's a pocketbook issue that matters to millions of people, especially senior citizens. And you seem to be frustrated at the moment because there's a bipartisan bill that's way late, at least for now. Talk about the bill and what's happening.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, this is once something that I thought that the administration was interested in tackling. Certainly Republicans and Democrats see this as a pocketbook issue. And we're hearing a lot from our constituents about their high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. We did pass a bill unanimously through the Judiciary Committee has to do with patent patent thickets. It's called where drug companies will file tens, sometimes more than 100 individual patents and in a way to discourage any generic competition. For example, there's a drug humerus, which is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. And it's a wonder drug. But the company who patented it has more than 120 separate patents on the same molecule. And in Europe, there are four competitors in place. So obviously we need more competition and to bring down prices and produce more affordable medications for our people. And it's a it's something I'm afraid is falling quickly, falling the casualty to impeachment mania. But in this specific instance, I've gone to the floor with Richard Blumenthal, my Democratic colleague from Connecticut, and it's been blocked by Senator Schumer. We're going to be back again this week to try to have some political accountability for blocking this common sense bill.

Guy Benson: What is his justification for blocking it?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think because he can and because he doesn't want Republicans to get any credit for anything positive in this area during an election cycle, election year coming up on an election. But I think we're going to try to smoke him out later this week. And in the end, I don't think you'll be able to sustain his position blocking it, because it's not it's not a partisan bill, but it is one that will actually lower drug costs for consumers. And I think that's a hard position to sustain.

Guy Benson: Senator, on that point, right, I'm all for choice and competition. I'm a. Capitalist I'm someone who believes in all of those fundamental values when it comes to an issue like the development of new miracle drugs. Right. I can understand if you bring in generic competitors, prices come down for the American people. I'm all for that. I'm in favor of that, of course. The counter argument that you sometimes hear from the pharmaceutical companies is it takes and this is true. It takes huge amounts of money to in research and development to innovate and create new drugs. And if they can't sort of get the benefit, the windfall from doing so, it disincentive Vice's research, development and innovation. What are the protections that these types of laws have to make sure that innovation isn't immediately sort of ripped off by competitors?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, you accurately described, I think, our intellectual property protection system under our under the Constitution that the you can patent something and you have exclusive rights to sell it for a period of time. The question is whether that time can be artificially extended by gamesmanship rather than by by the by the traditional patent protection period after which there is competition by generic generic competitors. And so they can recoup the costs of their research and development of these lifesaving drugs. We don't want to discourage innovation and we do want to protect intellectual property. But after a point there, it really becomes a matter of them maintaining their exclusive right to sell something by by artificially precluding that kind of competition, which we know in the end ultimately will benefit consumers and bring down prices, too.

Guy Benson: Senator, on health care, one of your colleagues running for president, Elizabeth Warren, has openly conceded. She has said that her single payer health care plan would make health care, private health care coverage illegal for 180 million people. She's openly considered that it would kill 2 million jobs. She has openly conceded that it would apply and be given by the taxpayers to illegal immigrants. She's she's admitting these things. And I wonder what you make of that. Not just on substance, but as a political matter.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, it's surreal to hear the here. After many years of arguing the Affordable Care Act was somehow the panacea that was going to solve all of our health care concerns. To hear Elizabeth Warren and other other radicals in her party say that's not good enough anymore, we want to take full control over your health care choices. And it will have the consequence that you just described, an incredible increase in costs and longer lines. By the way. And would would would destroy the private health insurance that 180 or so million people get from their employer. I think, you know, the Democrats have lost control of their party to their to their radical base. Nancy Pelosi has lost control of them and leading it to this ill, ill considered impeachment process, partisan impeachment process. But it looks like the base of the party is supporting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And these things like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, which are just completely unrealistic, will break break the bank and will concede more control to the federal government and less freedom for individuals to choose what they think is best for themselves and their families.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, last question briefly. Jeff Sessions announcing he wants his old job back. You served with him for a long time, a senator from Alabama. Your thoughts on him jumping back into the race, having served as attorney general for a while?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, Jeff Sessions is a friend of mine, and I did serve with him for a long time in the Senate before he became attorney general. Obviously, he got crosswise with the president when he recused himself from the from the investigation over the Russian activities. I believe he did had no choice but to do that under Department of Justice guidelines. I think he's he's conducted himself honorably to the best of his ability. He hadn't attacked the president, which I think is smart. And he's decided to go back and run and serve the people of Alabama. And I wish him well.

Guy Benson: Senator John Cornyn of Texas. We really appreciate your time. We'd love to have you back, sir.

Sen. Cornyn: I'd love to come back. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Guy Benson: We'll make that happen. And we'll take a quick break as we just get going. It's Tuesday. It's the Guy Benson Show. Don't go anywhere."

After Steyer filed to place his name on the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot, the one-time hedge fund manager turned billionaire environmental and progressive advocate took a shot at Bloomberg while answering questions from reporters.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE LAUNCHES 2020 BID

""I’ve traveled around full time for seven years and listened, said Steyer, who created the influential grassroots advocacy organization NextGenAmerica in 2013 and who has been one of the leaders of the push to impeach President Trump. “I feel as if anyone who doesn’t do that kind of traveling and face to face talking to Americans and more than that, listening to Americans, I don’t know how you could really in good conscience run for president.""

“I feel as if, as a Democrat, I’ve said about Michael Bloomberg, if he can’t accept the idea of a wealth tax, if he doesn’t embrace it, he doesn’t understand that inequality is at the heart of the problems in America right now, then I don’t think he should run, because I don’t think he can represent the Democratic Party,"" Steyer added.

Steyer was in New Hampshire on the same day that Bloomberg filed to place his name on the ballot in Arkansas, hours ahead of that state’s presidential primary filing deadline. On Friday, Bloomberg’s name was placed on the primary ballot in Alabama an hour ahead of that state’s filing deadline.

SANDERS BLASTS BLOOMBERG

Bloomberg – the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor -- changed his voter registration to Democrat last year. He flirted with a presidential bid early this year but ruled out a run in March. His top advisers said last week that the media and business mogul changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 Democratic White House contenders were not “well positioned” to beat Trump next November.

Steyer announced in January that he wouldn’t run for president but later changed his mind. Since launching his campaign in July, he’s spent at least $47 million on his White House bid, mostly on TV commercials.

Asked by Fox News if he’ll spend another $47 million on his campaign, Steyer said “at the beginning of this campaign our staff estimated that we’d spend $100 million. Do I think that that was a good guess? I have no idea.”

He went on to emphasize the importance of this presidential election, saying “when people ask me ‘What are you willing to put into this? How much do you care?’ unlimited.”

Steyer – who is pulling in the mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders – noted that the race is “probably more open today than it was three months ago or six months ago ... It’s more unsettled today than when I started. I don’t think I’m going to be the last person to enter this race.”

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – a long-shot for the nomination - also filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, doing so a couple of hours before Steyer.

When asked about Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is also reportedly mulling a late entry into the Democratic race, Bullock emphasized that Democrats “have to win back places we lost. I think I can do it ... I don’t know that another coastal person running is going to make that much of a difference. Look, we already have one candidate from Massachusetts [Elizabeth Warren]. Do we need another? We already have one billionaire running [Steyer], do we need another?”"

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen.

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”

AUDIBLE: ‘THE ENEMY WITHIN’

“Our politics are paralyzing the country. We practice suspicion or contempt where trust is needed, imposing a sentence of anger and loneliness on others and ourselves. We scorch our opponents with language that precludes compromise. We brush aside the possibility that a person with whom we disagree might be right. We talk about what divides us and seldom acknowledge what unites us. … Contending viewpoints and vocal dissent are inevitable, and not the issue. … What is dangerous is not that people have serious differences. It is the tone—the snarl, the scorn, the lacerating despair.” – Former Defense Secretary James Mattis in his piece “The Enemy Within,” published in the Atlantic.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

Deval Patrick (D) said he’d received encouragement to run for president in 2020, but he wasn’t prepared to subject his loved ones to “the cruelty of our elections process.” It came on the heels of related comments the former governor made to David Axelrod.

“It’s hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational or a celebrity – and I’m none of those things and I’m never going to be any of those things,” Patrick said in a podcast interview.

That was then; this is now.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick announced Thursday that he will run for the Democratic nomination for president. His decision to enter the primary comes against the backdrop of the realities of the political calendar – the filing deadline in all-important New Hampshire is Friday – as well as continued consternation from some Democrats about whether the current field presents viable options to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.

The former two-term governor of Massachusetts will reportedly travel to New Hampshire this morning, where he’ll file for the nation’s first presidential primary in person.

For those keeping score, Patrick pushes the Democrats’ 2020 field back up to 18 members – it was starting to shrink a bit from historic highs – though he and Montana’s Steve Bullock are the only current or former governors in the race. (Washington’s Jay Inslee and Colorado’s John Hickenlooper also ran, but ended their campaigns months ago.)

What’s more, the field may yet grow larger: former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is inching closer to a national bid – he’s already filed for a couple of primaries – and former Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly still weighing his 2020 options.

In terms of the calendar in a historical context, MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki added yesterday that Patrick is entering the race at the latest date of any presidential candidate since Pat Buchanan entered the 1992 Republican race on Dec. 10, 1991, though he did not win any primaries or caucuses. Gary Hart re-entered the 1988 Democratic race on Dec. 15, 1987, though he didn’t win any contests, either.

All of which serves as a reminder of the serious hurdles Patrick is facing.

In his favor, Patrick will be able to point to his successes as a two-term governor and his personal friendship with Barack Obama. Given the importance of the New Hampshire primary, it won’t hurt that the Massachusetts governor is from a neighboring state.

On the other hand, Patrick has limited national name recognition, no national operation, empty campaign coffers, little chance of making the next round of primary debates, and in New Hampshire he’ll face two rivals – Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren – who are also from neighboring states.

Complicating matters, I’m not altogether sure how Patrick will explain away his work with Bain Capital after Democratic criticisms of Mitt Romney’s work with the same private-equity firm in the recent past.

Presidential hopefuls who jump in late invariably fall short. Patrick may buck the trend, but the odds are not in his favor."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts reiterated her strong support for the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

Warren, who was in New Hampshire Wednesday to file to place her name on the Granite State's presidential primary ballot, also took another shot at former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg, who’s taking steps towards jumping into the Democratic race.

And she told Fox News that a potential entry this week by former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick wouldn’t complicate her own White House bid.

FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Warren – one of the first Democratic White House hopefuls to call for Trump’s impeachment -- told reporters after filing that “I believe it is appropriate for this impeachment inquiry to go forward. I think it should have happened earlier, but we're here now. Let’s do it.”

When asked if she had been watching the testimony from the televised public hearing, Warren said: “I just haven’t been able to catch up with it. Fortunately, I will catch up tonight.”

If the Democratic-controlled House impeaches the president, the GOP-led Senate would then hold a trial which could lead to Trump’s removal from office. Such a trial would probably keep Warren and the other Senate Democrats running for president off the campaign trail during the weeks leading up to the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I have Constitutional responsibilities,"" Warren said. ""I took an oath of office, as did everyone in Congress and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. And if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren told Fox News that she hadn’t talked with Patrick in recent days and said “no” when asked if the fellow Massachusetts Democrat’s potential entry into the race would complicate her own campaign. When asked about Patrick's years working at investment firm Bain Capital, Warren answered “I’m not here to criticize other Democrats. I’m here to talk about why I’m running for president.”

Patrick is likely to announce his candidacy on Thursday by video or social media, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday. He would then travel to neighboring New Hampshire on Friday the last day for candidates to file to place their names on the primary ballot.

Patrick isn’t the only Democrat likely to launch a campaign at this late date in the primary cycle. Bloomberg has placed his name on the presidential primary ballots in Alabama and Arkansas in recent days as he moves closer to launching a White House run.

I believe that what our election should be about is grassroots. How you build something all across New Hampshire, all across the country, and that we really shouldn’t have elections that are about billionaires calling all the shots, whether they’re reaching into their pockets to fund their own elections or whether they’re counting on getting other people to run,"" said Warren, who’s been critical of Bloomberg in recent days.

“I’ve noticed that billionaires go on TV and cry,"" she added. ""Other billionaires encourage their billionaire buddies to jump into the race.""

Warren may have been referring to billionaire Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman, who lamented during an interview on CNBC last week that Trump is dividing and polarizing Americans while Warren is pushing “Idiocy.” Like many other billionaires, Cooperman has heavily criticized Warren’s proposed tax on the richest Americans, calling it a “bankrupt concept.”"

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

""It's not a new thing. It's as old as hate. You know, the trick is we just got to figure out who we hate this week,"" argued Rowe on Fox Nation's ""Reality Check with David Webb.""

In September, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted, ""Billionaires should not exist."" Fellow 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was accused by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon of ""vilifying successful people"" and Warren has been cheered on the campaign trail for mocking billionaires' objections to her proposals.

""Who can we blame? That's the game,"" Rowe told Fox Nation host David Webb.

""This country has been successful because ... it was business and industry and expansion, whether in agriculture and technology, hard work, you know, people taking risk,"" observed Webb, saying that many in the media appear to be stoking Americans' ""envy"" of their fellow countrymen.

""For me, you know, it's even more human,"" continued Rowe. ""I think on some level, we wind up resenting everything we rely on. It's only a matter of time. But if you walk resentment back, it almost always comes from some kind of dependency.""

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" host said that the recent planned power outrages in California provided an example of resentment in action.

""Last week, I was without power for four days and a lot of my neighbors realized all of a sudden, 'Wait a second, nothing works.'"" he recalled. ""That makes people very angry. And they don't know who to blame. So they flip off the linemen. You know, they blame PG&E. They blame the politicians. They blame everything.""

""But deep down, what's really going on is they just got a reminder that they utterly rely on a little plastic switch and the miracle that happens when they flip it and they're not in control of any of that. They don't have a generator. They don't have the means to fix the problem,"" said Rowe, suggesting that resentment is being turned on the wealthy by those who believe that the economic system is not working for them.

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

Rowe suggested that Americans must empower themselves by re-evaluating the definition of a good job in America. He started the ""Mike Rowe Works Foundation,"" which educates people about, ""millions of 'shovel ready' jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.""

""We've got over 7 million jobs in this country... that we need to fill,"" observed Webb. ""And in order to fill those jobs, we've got to get people through the right education.""

""Look on 'Dirty Jobs,' I failed in this area. I could have done a better job,"" admitted Rowe. ""But of the 300 people we featured, 40 were multimillionaires. Nobody knows it because they were covered in crap because they were crawling through a sewer or working in a septic tank. We don't associate optically any level of success with somebody who's covered in filth... reminding people of that is important,"" he concluded.

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

AUDIBLE: THESE GO TO 11

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

WELCOME TO THE RACE DEVAL PATRICK

Fox News: “Former two-term Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Patrick declared his candidacy for the White House in a video on social media and in an email sent to supporters early Thursday. ‘I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field that bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,’ Patrick said. ‘But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country. So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.’ Patrick is expected to travel later on Thursday to neighboring New Hampshire to file for the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Friday is the last day for candidates to place their names on the primary ballot.”



Biden proposes $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan - Politico: “Joe Biden wants to spend $1.3 trillion on infrastructure as president, aiming to reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and shore up the ailing Highway Trust Fund with ‘new revenues’ in a plan released Thursday that's reminiscent of the Obama years. Biden’s 12-page plan promises to ‘ensure new revenues are secured to stabilize the Highway Trust Fund’ but doesn’t specify where those revenues would come from or how he would get political consensus for them. In many ways it's also a throwback to the administration of President Barack Obama, with planks related to ‘complete streets,’ repairing existing infrastructure before building new and calling for investments in transit and high-speed rail. The plan’s goal of working directly with cities, instead of always going through state departments of transportation as an intermediary, is another throwback.”



Pragmatic Klobuchar gaining ground - Time: “While Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proffered revolutionary proposals—including free college tuition, nationwide student-debt cancellation and Medicare for All—[Amy] Klobuchar has staked out a platform defined by pragmatism. Her higher-education plan centers on free in-state community college and higher Pell Grant caps, and her health care proposal offers a public option through which people could purchase access to Medicare or Medicaid. …Klobuchar has seized the opportunity to brand herself as the moderate alternative—a take-your-vitamins realist in a field defined by idealism. There’s some evidence her strategy is working. In the six days after the October debate … Klobuchar’s campaign raked in $2.1 million… She has since become one of 10 candidates to qualify for the November debate in Atlanta, and one of six to qualify for the December one in Los Angeles. Her support in the Hawkeye State has swelled too.”



Post heart attack Sanders trying to rebound - NYT: “Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. … Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. … Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. … His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign… He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue.”



Warren attacks billionaires in new campaign ad - CNBC: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is launching a new attack on the billionaires who have criticized her proposed taxes and policies with a new ad set to air on CNBC this week, according to a campaign aide. Titled ‘Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,’ the ad takes aim at longtime investor Leon Cooperman, former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. The ad will premiere Thursday on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ which airs at 9 a.m. ET, and Jim Cramer’s ‘Mad Money,’ which airs at 6 p.m. ET, in all New York and Washington, D.C., markets, the aide added. The ad will be part of a digital buy, as well. … The ad opens with Warren telling a campaign rally: ‘It is time for a wealth tax.’ The ad then plays clips of the aforementioned billionaires.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE HOUSE REPRESENTS

“Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 52



TIME OUT: ‘CALL ME ISHMAEL.’

History: “Moby-Dick is now considered a great classic of American literature… Initially, though, the book about Captain Ahab and his quest to catch a giant white whale was a flop. Its author, Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. … Melville’s sixth book, Moby-Dick, was first published in October 1851 in London, in three volumes titled The Whale, and then in the U.S. a month later [on Nov. 14, 1851]. Melville had promised his publisher an adventure story similar to his popular earlier works, but instead, Moby-Dick was a tragic epic, influenced in part by Melville’s friend and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose novels include The Scarlet Letter. … Melville died in 1891, largely forgotten by the literary world. By the 1920s, scholars had rediscovered his work, particularly Moby-Dick, which would eventually become a staple of high school reading lists across the United States.”

FIRST DAY OF HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Fox News: “All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president. At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ‘hearsay can be much better evidence than direct’ … It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats. … Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. ‘My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,’ Slotkin said as the hearings concluded…”



Pelosi says Trump committed bribery - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump committed ‘bribery,’ an impeachable offense, by trying to force Ukraine into tarnishing a political rival to help him in the 2020 election. The speaker’s remark is one of her strongest statements yet on the scandal engulfing Trump that is threatening his presidency. Bribery is one of the specific crimes spelled out in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. ‘I am saying what the president has admitted to and said it’s perfect — it’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery,’ Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference Thursday. … Still, Pelosi cautioned, she isn’t yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to happen by the end of this year.”



Report: Republicans discuss prolonging Senate impeachment trial - WaPo: “Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race — potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer. Those conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House. The discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.”



Did anything new come from the hearings? - Fox News: “[Wednesday] offered one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about ‘the investigations,’ to which Sondland supposedly responded that ‘the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.’ Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine. ‘Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,’ Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. ‘At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.’”



What’s next - AP: “Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country. … On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump’s direction. … Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council … Gordon Sondland, Trump’s European Union ambassador … and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton’s concerns about Ukraine. … The public hearings are expected to last at least another week.”



White House brings in backup to unify strategy - WashEx: “Newly appointed White House aide Tony Sayegh will try to bring cohesion to a disorderly White House impeachment response… The Washington Examiner has learned that Sayegh, a former Treasury official, will work with the White House communications team, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff, and other administration offices to develop and streamline a strategy to dispute allegations and make sure Republicans are on the same page. … Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was brought in to partner with Sayegh and will be the media face of the anti-impeachment campaign, with plans to leverage her legal background to discredit allegations by House Democrats that the president abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Impeachment and the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the facts surrounding the impeachment hearings: “The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held. Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction. Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?” More here.



JON HUNTSMAN ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR UTAH GOVERNOR

The Salt Lake Tribune: “Former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman says he’s grown weary of the national political scene, with its ‘theatrics,’ time-wasting and dearth of meaningful action. Now, he’s asking Utah’s voters to return him to what he calls ‘the best job in the world’ — working as governor. ‘For a very long time, we’ve served our country in the top two diplomatic posts in the world. Now we feel it is time to give back to our home state again,’ Huntsman said on a campaign video posted Thursday morning. He’s vying for a third term as governor in the 2020 election, a little more than 10 years since he last held the post. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2009. … News leaked Wednesday night that Huntsman would be kicking off his campaign Thursday, and he did with an early call-in to KSL radio and by launching his website and campaign materials.”



RNC jumps in to help Louisiana governor’s race - Politico: “The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor’s race ahead of Saturday’s runoff — a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks. The last-minute spending doubles the committee’s investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Trump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.”

GOOD PIGGIES

NY Post: “These pigs have a nose for nose candy. Italy’s Il Tirreno reported that authorities believe wild boars in Tuscany have sniffed out some 20,000 euros (about $22,000) worth of cocaine buried in the woods near Montepulciano. Local police learned of the incident after tapping the phone lines of a suspected drug-trafficking group, who revealed the incident during one of their calls. The powder had been stored in jars and tucked into waterproof packages. Allegedly, a boar had stomped the earth where the jars had been buried, which caused the containers to burst, scattering the illicit stimulant across the forest floor. Local officials claim this particular gang is responsible for slinging some two kilograms of blow per month to club-goers around the cities of Arezzo and Siena between September 2018 and March 2019… The drug dealers — one Italian and three Albanians — have been arrested and face charges for drug trafficking.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“I don’t think the West needs to apologize — or pay — for having invented the steam engine. In fact, I’ve long favored a real climate-change pact, strong and enforceable, that would impose relatively uniform demands on China, India, the United States, the European Union and any others willing to join.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on June 8, 2017.

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries.

Deval Patrick (D) said he’d received encouragement to run for president in 2020, but he wasn’t prepared to subject his loved ones to “the cruelty of our elections process.” It came on the heels of related comments the former governor made to David Axelrod.

“It’s hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational or a celebrity – and I’m none of those things and I’m never going to be any of those things,” Patrick said in a podcast interview.

That was then; this is now.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick announced Thursday that he will run for the Democratic nomination for president. His decision to enter the primary comes against the backdrop of the realities of the political calendar – the filing deadline in all-important New Hampshire is Friday – as well as continued consternation from some Democrats about whether the current field presents viable options to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.

The former two-term governor of Massachusetts will reportedly travel to New Hampshire this morning, where he’ll file for the nation’s first presidential primary in person.

For those keeping score, Patrick pushes the Democrats’ 2020 field back up to 18 members – it was starting to shrink a bit from historic highs – though he and Montana’s Steve Bullock are the only current or former governors in the race. (Washington’s Jay Inslee and Colorado’s John Hickenlooper also ran, but ended their campaigns months ago.)

What’s more, the field may yet grow larger: former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is inching closer to a national bid – he’s already filed for a couple of primaries – and former Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly still weighing his 2020 options.

In terms of the calendar in a historical context, MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki added yesterday that Patrick is entering the race at the latest date of any presidential candidate since Pat Buchanan entered the 1992 Republican race on Dec. 10, 1991, though he did not win any primaries or caucuses. Gary Hart re-entered the 1988 Democratic race on Dec. 15, 1987, though he didn’t win any contests, either.

All of which serves as a reminder of the serious hurdles Patrick is facing.

In his favor, Patrick will be able to point to his successes as a two-term governor and his personal friendship with Barack Obama. Given the importance of the New Hampshire primary, it won’t hurt that the Massachusetts governor is from a neighboring state.

On the other hand, Patrick has limited national name recognition, no national operation, empty campaign coffers, little chance of making the next round of primary debates, and in New Hampshire he’ll face two rivals – Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren – who are also from neighboring states.

Complicating matters, I’m not altogether sure how Patrick will explain away his work with Bain Capital after Democratic criticisms of Mitt Romney’s work with the same private-equity firm in the recent past.

Presidential hopefuls who jump in late invariably fall short. Patrick may buck the trend, but the odds are not in his favor."

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,504 North Carolina voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 669 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic primary and 574 the GOP primary. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters, 3.5 points for Democratic primary voters, and 4 points for GOP primary voters."

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

WELCOME TO THE RACE DEVAL PATRICK

Fox News: “Former two-term Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Patrick declared his candidacy for the White House in a video on social media and in an email sent to supporters early Thursday. ‘I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field that bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,’ Patrick said. ‘But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country. So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.’ Patrick is expected to travel later on Thursday to neighboring New Hampshire to file for the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Friday is the last day for candidates to place their names on the primary ballot.”



Biden proposes $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan - Politico: “Joe Biden wants to spend $1.3 trillion on infrastructure as president, aiming to reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and shore up the ailing Highway Trust Fund with ‘new revenues’ in a plan released Thursday that's reminiscent of the Obama years. Biden’s 12-page plan promises to ‘ensure new revenues are secured to stabilize the Highway Trust Fund’ but doesn’t specify where those revenues would come from or how he would get political consensus for them. In many ways it's also a throwback to the administration of President Barack Obama, with planks related to ‘complete streets,’ repairing existing infrastructure before building new and calling for investments in transit and high-speed rail. The plan’s goal of working directly with cities, instead of always going through state departments of transportation as an intermediary, is another throwback.”



Pragmatic Klobuchar gaining ground - Time: “While Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proffered revolutionary proposals—including free college tuition, nationwide student-debt cancellation and Medicare for All—[Amy] Klobuchar has staked out a platform defined by pragmatism. Her higher-education plan centers on free in-state community college and higher Pell Grant caps, and her health care proposal offers a public option through which people could purchase access to Medicare or Medicaid. …Klobuchar has seized the opportunity to brand herself as the moderate alternative—a take-your-vitamins realist in a field defined by idealism. There’s some evidence her strategy is working. In the six days after the October debate … Klobuchar’s campaign raked in $2.1 million… She has since become one of 10 candidates to qualify for the November debate in Atlanta, and one of six to qualify for the December one in Los Angeles. Her support in the Hawkeye State has swelled too.”



Post heart attack Sanders trying to rebound - NYT: “Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. … Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. … Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. … His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign… He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue.”



Warren attacks billionaires in new campaign ad - CNBC: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is launching a new attack on the billionaires who have criticized her proposed taxes and policies with a new ad set to air on CNBC this week, according to a campaign aide. Titled ‘Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,’ the ad takes aim at longtime investor Leon Cooperman, former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. The ad will premiere Thursday on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ which airs at 9 a.m. ET, and Jim Cramer’s ‘Mad Money,’ which airs at 6 p.m. ET, in all New York and Washington, D.C., markets, the aide added. The ad will be part of a digital buy, as well. … The ad opens with Warren telling a campaign rally: ‘It is time for a wealth tax.’ The ad then plays clips of the aforementioned billionaires.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE HOUSE REPRESENTS

“Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 52



TIME OUT: ‘CALL ME ISHMAEL.’

History: “Moby-Dick is now considered a great classic of American literature… Initially, though, the book about Captain Ahab and his quest to catch a giant white whale was a flop. Its author, Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. … Melville’s sixth book, Moby-Dick, was first published in October 1851 in London, in three volumes titled The Whale, and then in the U.S. a month later [on Nov. 14, 1851]. Melville had promised his publisher an adventure story similar to his popular earlier works, but instead, Moby-Dick was a tragic epic, influenced in part by Melville’s friend and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose novels include The Scarlet Letter. … Melville died in 1891, largely forgotten by the literary world. By the 1920s, scholars had rediscovered his work, particularly Moby-Dick, which would eventually become a staple of high school reading lists across the United States.”

FIRST DAY OF HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Fox News: “All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president. At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ‘hearsay can be much better evidence than direct’ … It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats. … Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. ‘My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,’ Slotkin said as the hearings concluded…”



Pelosi says Trump committed bribery - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump committed ‘bribery,’ an impeachable offense, by trying to force Ukraine into tarnishing a political rival to help him in the 2020 election. The speaker’s remark is one of her strongest statements yet on the scandal engulfing Trump that is threatening his presidency. Bribery is one of the specific crimes spelled out in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. ‘I am saying what the president has admitted to and said it’s perfect — it’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery,’ Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference Thursday. … Still, Pelosi cautioned, she isn’t yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to happen by the end of this year.”



Report: Republicans discuss prolonging Senate impeachment trial - WaPo: “Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race — potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer. Those conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House. The discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.”



Did anything new come from the hearings? - Fox News: “[Wednesday] offered one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about ‘the investigations,’ to which Sondland supposedly responded that ‘the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.’ Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine. ‘Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,’ Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. ‘At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.’”



What’s next - AP: “Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country. … On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump’s direction. … Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council … Gordon Sondland, Trump’s European Union ambassador … and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton’s concerns about Ukraine. … The public hearings are expected to last at least another week.”



White House brings in backup to unify strategy - WashEx: “Newly appointed White House aide Tony Sayegh will try to bring cohesion to a disorderly White House impeachment response… The Washington Examiner has learned that Sayegh, a former Treasury official, will work with the White House communications team, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff, and other administration offices to develop and streamline a strategy to dispute allegations and make sure Republicans are on the same page. … Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was brought in to partner with Sayegh and will be the media face of the anti-impeachment campaign, with plans to leverage her legal background to discredit allegations by House Democrats that the president abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Impeachment and the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the facts surrounding the impeachment hearings: “The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held. Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction. Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?” More here.



JON HUNTSMAN ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR UTAH GOVERNOR

The Salt Lake Tribune: “Former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman says he’s grown weary of the national political scene, with its ‘theatrics,’ time-wasting and dearth of meaningful action. Now, he’s asking Utah’s voters to return him to what he calls ‘the best job in the world’ — working as governor. ‘For a very long time, we’ve served our country in the top two diplomatic posts in the world. Now we feel it is time to give back to our home state again,’ Huntsman said on a campaign video posted Thursday morning. He’s vying for a third term as governor in the 2020 election, a little more than 10 years since he last held the post. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2009. … News leaked Wednesday night that Huntsman would be kicking off his campaign Thursday, and he did with an early call-in to KSL radio and by launching his website and campaign materials.”



RNC jumps in to help Louisiana governor’s race - Politico: “The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor’s race ahead of Saturday’s runoff — a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks. The last-minute spending doubles the committee’s investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Trump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.”

GOOD PIGGIES

NY Post: “These pigs have a nose for nose candy. Italy’s Il Tirreno reported that authorities believe wild boars in Tuscany have sniffed out some 20,000 euros (about $22,000) worth of cocaine buried in the woods near Montepulciano. Local police learned of the incident after tapping the phone lines of a suspected drug-trafficking group, who revealed the incident during one of their calls. The powder had been stored in jars and tucked into waterproof packages. Allegedly, a boar had stomped the earth where the jars had been buried, which caused the containers to burst, scattering the illicit stimulant across the forest floor. Local officials claim this particular gang is responsible for slinging some two kilograms of blow per month to club-goers around the cities of Arezzo and Siena between September 2018 and March 2019… The drug dealers — one Italian and three Albanians — have been arrested and face charges for drug trafficking.”

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries.

Next Wednesday's debate in Atlanta will be broadcast on MSNBC, 9-11 p.m. EST.

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”

TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6.

""A lot of folks ... feel very good about what Trump has accomplished. The No. 1 thing that I've heard though, was, 'I wish he would just stop doing that thing on Twitter,""' Caldwell said on Fox Nation.

""Even conservatives,"" he continued, ""even though he has a 95 percent approval rating within the conservative party, conservatives are having issues with his tweets because they're distracting.""

Trump adopted the platform as a means of directly communicating with the American people. Not known to hold back, his Twitter account -- which currently holds 66.8 M followers -- has attracted worldwide attention since the 2016 campaign.

Now considered official presidential statements, Trump uses the platform to circumvent the mainstream media, connecting directly with citizens and leaders across the country.

While many are opposed to the president's use of Twitter, which often features name-calling and inflammatory statements, he remains among the platform's most popular users.

Last month, Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris put pressure on Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to ""do something"" about Trump's account.

""Hey, @jack, Time to do something about this,"" Harris wrote.

She also urged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump’s account as ”a matter of safety and corporate accountability.""

“I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice,” Harris said during a primary presidential debate.

TRUMP IN TWITTER BATTLE WITH SCARAMUCCI, SAYING HE'D DO ANYTHING TO STAY IN SPOTLIGHT

Founder of the FiveThirtyEight website, Nate Silver, fired back on Twitter, defending the president's use of the platform.

""Hey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump's tweets are extremely newsworthy and I'm happy that you've given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,"" he tweeted.

Silver's response drew criticism from many, including other reporters who seemed to side with Harris on the issue, before Twitter eventually put the matter to rest.

“We focus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,” Twitter said, calling the actions of world leaders on Twitter “largely new ground and unprecedented.”

In January 2018, the company responded to calls to shut down Trump's account saying, “blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” Twitter said.

“It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.”

NATE SILVER DEFENDS TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT

Co-host of the Fox Nation show Tom Shillue disagreed with Caldwell's statement that conservatives largely oppose the president's Twitter usage, and even encouraged Trump to ""tone it up.""

""I disagree with that...I could have him tone it up a little bit because ... I've been hearing this since he started ... 'Oh, I like the president, he's got to calm down with the tweets ... He's not gonna,"" Shillue said. ""So I say, stop saying it, and ... embrace it.""

""It's hilarious,"" he continued. ""I think we have gotten used to it. The only people who haven't gotten used to it...aside from the Trump haters, it's these kinds of...old line conservatives who think there's a way to sell conservatism...that way stinks,"" Shillue said.

While Caldwell acknowledged a double standard from Democrats who use similar rhetoric without backlash, he did call for the president to tone it down.

""We are leaders in this movement,"" he said, ""and I think it's important to calm it down a little bit.""

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.

OBAMA SOUNDS OFF ON CANCEL CULTURE, 'WOKE' PURITY: 'THAT'S NOT ACTIVISM'

“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't want to see crazy stuff,"" he said. ""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids, and share certain things with you.”

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

Kamala Harris, whose campaign cut staff in a dramatic restructuring last month, is now polling at just 3 percent, tying her with Michael Bloomberg for fifth place among the Democratic Party’s presidential nominees -- according to a poll released Friday -- even though Bloomberg hasn't even formally announced his 2020 candidacy.

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”

TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

SEE, COWS

AFP: “Three cows swept into the ocean when Hurricane Dorian struck the US east coast in September were found living on a string of sandy islands miles away from their home… The bovine trio is believed to have swum four to five miles before placing hoof on land – in this case an island of sand dunes and scattered vegetation that is part of North Carolina's Outer Banks… The animals were recently discovered by park rangers at the Cape Lookout National Seashore... Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6. The cows were identified by their keeper, Woody Hancock. They will likely be sedated and sent home on a boat…”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“France does not expect to rival America but to tame it, restrain it, thwart it — and to accept the world's laurels for having led the way.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on March 17, 2003.

""A lot of folks ... feel very good about what Trump has accomplished. The No. 1 thing that I've heard though, was, 'I wish he would just stop doing that thing on Twitter,""' Caldwell said on Fox Nation.

""Even conservatives,"" he continued, ""even though he has a 95 percent approval rating within the conservative party, conservatives are having issues with his tweets because they're distracting.""

Trump adopted the platform as a means of directly communicating with the American people. Not known to hold back, his Twitter account -- which currently holds 66.8 M followers -- has attracted worldwide attention since the 2016 campaign.

Now considered official presidential statements, Trump uses the platform to circumvent the mainstream media, connecting directly with citizens and leaders across the country.

While many are opposed to the president's use of Twitter, which often features name-calling and inflammatory statements, he remains among the platform's most popular users.

Last month, Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris put pressure on Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to ""do something"" about Trump's account.

""Hey, @jack, Time to do something about this,"" Harris wrote.

She also urged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump’s account as ”a matter of safety and corporate accountability.""

“I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice,” Harris said during a primary presidential debate.

TRUMP IN TWITTER BATTLE WITH SCARAMUCCI, SAYING HE'D DO ANYTHING TO STAY IN SPOTLIGHT

Founder of the FiveThirtyEight website, Nate Silver, fired back on Twitter, defending the president's use of the platform.

""Hey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump's tweets are extremely newsworthy and I'm happy that you've given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,"" he tweeted.

Silver's response drew criticism from many, including other reporters who seemed to side with Harris on the issue, before Twitter eventually put the matter to rest.

“We focus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,” Twitter said, calling the actions of world leaders on Twitter “largely new ground and unprecedented.”

In January 2018, the company responded to calls to shut down Trump's account saying, “blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” Twitter said.

“It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.”

NATE SILVER DEFENDS TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT

Co-host of the Fox Nation show Tom Shillue disagreed with Caldwell's statement that conservatives largely oppose the president's Twitter usage, and even encouraged Trump to ""tone it up.""

""I disagree with that...I could have him tone it up a little bit because ... I've been hearing this since he started ... 'Oh, I like the president, he's got to calm down with the tweets ... He's not gonna,"" Shillue said. ""So I say, stop saying it, and ... embrace it.""

""It's hilarious,"" he continued. ""I think we have gotten used to it. The only people who haven't gotten used to it...aside from the Trump haters, it's these kinds of...old line conservatives who think there's a way to sell conservatism...that way stinks,"" Shillue said.

While Caldwell acknowledged a double standard from Democrats who use similar rhetoric without backlash, he did call for the president to tone it down.

""We are leaders in this movement,"" he said, ""and I think it's important to calm it down a little bit.""

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""You've got the Iowa [caucuses] coming up the first week of August, followed by New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses, and then a caucus, a primary in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

Mayor Pete Buttigieg nine percentage points clear of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., indicating the one-time longshot is now a force to be reckoned with in the race for the Democratic nomination.

The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Buttigieg with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

Warren's support has dropped six percentage points from the September CNN/DMR/Mediacom poll, while Biden's backing has slipped five percentage points. Sanders' support has risen four percentage points from two months ago.

FOX NEWS POLL: CLOSE RACES BETWEEN TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS IN NORTH CAROLINA

No one else in the poll cracked double-digit support. In fifth place, behind Sanders, is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who earned six percent of the vote.

""This @DMRegister poll confirms what we’re seeing every day — MOMENTUM!"" Klobuchar tweeted Saturday night. ""

Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii; businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are all tied at three percent. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not formally announced his candidacy, earned two percent.

Buttigieg has moved to the front of the pack in other recent polls of Iowa. A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday pegged Buttigieg at 22 percent, Biden at 19 percent, Warren at 18 percent and Sanders at 13 percent. Buttigieg's support jumped 14 percentage points compared to Monmouth’s last survey in August, while Biden’s dropped seven percentage points, Warren’s edged down two percentage points, and Sanders jumped five percentage points from the August survey.

A Quinnipiac survey released last week however had Buttigieg one point behind Warren, at 19 and 20 percentage points respectively.

BUTTIGIEG CLAIMS NARROW IOWA LEAD AMID PRIMARY SURGE: POLL

Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Navy war veteran and would be America’s first openly gay president if elected. Without any sort of Washington name-recognition, the mayor’s campaign seemed a longshot before he rose to middle-tier status in the spring.

Buttigieg for many seems to offer a more moderate approach than the radical policy proposals of Warren and Sanders, and unlike Biden, he does not have to fight many concerns about his age or past voting record. Among Iowa caucusgoers, 63 percent say Buttigieg's views are about right, while only seven percent say they are too liberal and 13 percent say they are too conservative.

According to the CNN/DMR poll, Buttigieg excels with caucusgoers with incomes over $100,000 (32 percent) and self-described moderates (also 32 percent) but underperforms with union households (17 percent) and those who call themselves very liberal (12 percent)."

“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.

“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't want to see crazy stuff,"" he said. ""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities.

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

Biden – he has deep ties to South Carolina -- stands at 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is a distant second – at 13 percent -- with Sanders at 11 percent and Buttigieg at 6 percent.

And Biden stands at 36 percent among likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters in a University of South Florida survey, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at just 10 percent.

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

But fellow Democrats seem to be hinting his stand againt legalizing marijuana may be outdated too.

The latest pushback came Sunday night, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that “Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health.”

AOC's Twitter post -- which mirrored the pro-pot stands of Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom she supports for president, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and others running for the party's 2020 nomination -- came a day after Biden told a town hall audience in Las Vegas that he still hasn’t seen enough evidence that marijuana is not a gateway drug, so he can't yet back legalizing weed.

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally,"" Biden said, according to Business Insider. ""I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.""

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."" — Joe Biden

Sanders said Oct. 24 he would legalize the drug by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House, Fox News reported.



SANDERS INTRODUCES PLAN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE DURING FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE



Last year, Sanders' home state of Vermont legalized possession of one ounce of pot and letting each adult resident grow two plants for personal use. He has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and argued criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.



""Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Biden, however, spoke in favor of a more cautious approach. He said states should be able to legalize marijuana if they want but added he wouldn’t overturn federal law right away.



In addition, he supports medical marijuana and believes possession of the substance ""should not be a crime,"" the Business Insider report said.



Much of Biden’s 40-year Senate career took place during the federal government's War on Drugs, which included harsh criminal penalties for nonviolent drug users, Business Insider reported.



The former vice president also said in a June campaign speech that he supported expunging past convictions for possession.



BOOKER, OTHER 2020 DEM PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS, INTRODUCE FEDERAL MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION BILL



But contrary to Biden's Las Vegas comments, several national organizations say there is no solid evidence to support the claim that using marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs, the report said. A 1999 Institute of Medicine report said marijuana ""typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use,"" but it ""does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.""



The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that research shows ""the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, 'harder' substances,"" and drug use can be affected by numerous other biological and environmental factors, the report continued.



The majority of current candidates openly support nationwide legalization.



Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, with only nine states where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent Gallup poll found 66 percent of Americans support fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.



The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.



While Sanders became the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates Warren and Booker as well as Sen. Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records."

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

The decision by the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman to conduct the first series of interviews behind closed doors allowed Republicans to appropriately brand the enterprise as unfair and clandestine.

His next step, orchestrating a steady stream of leaks and disclosures timed and edited for maximum impact, all but guaranteed that last week’s subsequent live hearings would be anti-climactic.

Schiff stole his own thunder.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARING ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

AUDIBLE: AUDIBLE, INDEED

“TOTAL EXONERATION!” – Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, tweeted after an interview Monday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” in response to what sounded like him expelling a thunderous toot while on air. The official ‘Hardball’ Twitter account clarified the noise was from someone dragging a coffee mug across a table in the studio.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

NBCUniversal and parent company Comcast have been accused of multiple abuses of power amid ongoing scandals related to Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, organized an effort for key 2020 Democratic hopefuls to address the issues with DNC chairman Tom Perez through a harshly worded letter obtained by Fox News.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

“We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors,” the letter begins.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network – but UltraViolet has vowed not to give up until an independent investigation is launched.

“NBC’s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault. Yet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable,” the letter said. “That's what allowed the behavior of powerful abusers inside the company to go unchecked. The troubling reports about management’s role to cover up abuse demonstrate that Comcast should have and needs to do more to shift the work culture and pursue significant structural changes in order to prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC. Until that happens, employees are at risk.”

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

UltraViolet has called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and “every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at the Peacock Network. The group has also organized protests outside the network’s New York City headquarters.

“Current and former NBCUniversal employees have courageously put their livelihoods on the line to demand change and accountability. UltraViolet and our 1.2 million members have their backs, and we are proud to say that Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have their backs too,” UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas said.

Oppenheim, who is Lack’s top deputy, has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. He is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

“Everyone on the side of survivors has a role to play in using their influence to push Comcast and NBC to do the right thing. The DNC has leverage as a critical media partner in the 2020 election and they owe it to survivors to use it,” Thomas added.

The letter said Democrats must offer an alternative to President Trump but “can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership.”

The letter, signed by Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren, concludes by saying it is “critical that the Democratic National Committee make clear that they support survivors of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that Comcast and NBC News take steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks.”

NBCUniversal’s liberal cable news network, MSNBC, is scheduled to host a presidential debate in Atlanta on Wednesday."

But two new public opinion surveys in South Carolina – the first Southern state to vote in the race for the White House - shows the former vice president holding a large lead over his rivals for the Democratic nomination.

Biden – he has deep ties to South Carolina -- stands at 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is a distant second – at 13 percent -- with Sanders at 11 percent and Buttigieg at 6 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED SEVERAL STOCK PHOTOS

And Biden stands at 36 percent among likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters in a University of South Florida survey, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at just 10 percent.

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

Among black voters – a majority of Democratic presidential primary voters in South Carolina – Biden stands at 44 percent. Sanders, the Vermont senator, is second at 10 percent, with everyone else registering in single digits.

THE LATEST 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO THE TOP IN A NEW IOWA POLL

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Nov. 13 through Sunday, with 768 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.

The Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida poll was conducted Nov. 5-13, with 436 likely Palmetto State state Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.

Steyer was in fourth place - at 8 percent - in the poll - with Harris at 4 percent. Buttigieg stood at 3 percent, and Booker at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less.

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid.

Sanders is making his second straight White House run. His campaign highlighted that the candidate didn’t reach the 4 million individuals milestone in the 2016 cycle until after February’s New Hampshire primary, which is still more nearly three months away.

Sanders, though, didn’t announce his 2016 bid until late April 2015. This time around, Sanders launched his presidential campaign in February of 2019, two months ahead of his 2016 schedule.

Sanders – like his progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – is relying on small-dollar grassroots donations to fuel his campaign. He hauled in $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, more than any other Democratic White House hopeful. That haul was powered by some 1.4 million contributions.

Sanders’ donor announcement came on the eve of Wednesday’s fifth-round Democratic presidential nomination debate, which will be held in Atlanta."

But fellow Democrats seem to be hinting his stand againt legalizing marijuana may be outdated too.

The latest pushback came Sunday night, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that “Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health.”

AOC's Twitter post -- which mirrored the pro-pot stands of Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom she supports for president, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and others running for the party's 2020 nomination -- came a day after Biden told a town hall audience in Las Vegas that he still hasn’t seen enough evidence that marijuana is not a gateway drug, so he can't yet back legalizing weed.

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally,"" Biden said, according to Business Insider. ""I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.""

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."" — Joe Biden

Sanders said Oct. 24 he would legalize the drug by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House, Fox News reported.



SANDERS INTRODUCES PLAN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE DURING FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE



Last year, Sanders' home state of Vermont legalized possession of one ounce of pot and letting each adult resident grow two plants for personal use. He has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and argued criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.



""Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Biden, however, spoke in favor of a more cautious approach. He said states should be able to legalize marijuana if they want but added he wouldn’t overturn federal law right away.



In addition, he supports medical marijuana and believes possession of the substance ""should not be a crime,"" the Business Insider report said.



Much of Biden’s 40-year Senate career took place during the federal government's War on Drugs, which included harsh criminal penalties for nonviolent drug users, Business Insider reported.



The former vice president also said in a June campaign speech that he supported expunging past convictions for possession.

But contrary to Biden's Las Vegas comments, several national organizations say there is no solid evidence to support the claim that using marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs, the report said. A 1999 Institute of Medicine report said marijuana ""typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use,"" but it ""does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.""



The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that research shows ""the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, 'harder' substances,"" and drug use can be affected by numerous other biological and environmental factors, the report continued.



The majority of current candidates openly support nationwide legalization.



Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, with only nine states where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent Gallup poll found 66 percent of Americans support fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.



The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.



While Sanders became the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates Warren and Booker as well as Sen. Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records."

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

So why don't they ditch primaries, too?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-electoral-college-primaries-david-avella,"While South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge in the polls in Iowa, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has consistently shown staying power nationally to remain the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. However, before she declares victory and announces its time to focus on the general election, here is an obvious question for her. If she is so convinced that a national popular vote is how we should elect the president of the United States in the general election, why don't Democrats hold a national primary to select their presidential nominee?

At the core of Warren’s plans for America is the end of the Electoral College. She wants to replace it with a national popular vote.

She is hardly alone among Democrats. Day after day, we are treated to Democrats decrying the Electoral College as being unfair, as being wrong, as being something that gives too much-undeserved power to voters in less populated states.

LIZ PEEK: SCHIFF STEERS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD A DITCH — HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

However, when one examines the arcane and near-mystical process the Democrats have chosen to determine their nominee for president of the United States, one would be hard-pressed to conclude anything other than that Democrats are unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

It would seem to be a pretty simple matter to switch to a national primary where whoever receives the most votes is declared the winner. Why don’t Democrats do that?

One concern could be that with multiple candidates vying for the party’s nomination, one of them could prevail with less than a majority of the votes. That is surely so. Would not that same logic apply to anytime there was a strong third-party candidate?

We did not hear Democrats in 1992, 2000 or any other time arguing that only the votes of the two major-party candidates should count in the presidential tally to ensure the winner has earned a majority of the votes.

In 2016, when Hillary Clinton prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it is pretty clear the Democratic National Committee (DNC) put more than a thumb on the scale to all but assure that she prevailed.

If you go back to the last truly contested race for the Democratic Party nomination, in 2008, the process used might startle you. Suffice it to say, it was a little different than one man, one vote.

Florida and Michigan did not hold their primaries on the days the DNC deemed proper, so their votes were treated in a different fashion than those cast by voters in states bowing to the DNC. They did not even count the popular vote from Michigan (where President Obama did not have his name on the ballot). Eventually, the decision was made to split the delegate vote evenly in these two states, despite Clinton having defeated Obama soundly in Florida where both names were on the ballot.

It gets weirder. Democrats abroad, including those in American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands had delegates who each received a half vote. Would it not just have been easier to have them cut the number of delegates in half?

At the end of the day, if you include the votes cast in Michigan, Hillary Clinton received 48.1 percent and Barack Obama 47.4 percent. Really close.

When delegates selected via primary and caucus were totaled up, neither candidate had enough to win at the convention.

So, just how did the Democrats resolve this tricky and difficult situation? Why, they turned to their consiglieres, otherwise known as super delegates. These are elected officials, party officials, etc.

In other words, an elitist class established to fix problems when the electorate gets out of hand. The super delegates overwhelmingly sided with Obama, and he became the nominee.

Fast forward to 2020. The Democrats are still holding a series of primaries, conventions, and caucuses. Fully 16 percent of the delegates will do nothing more than wake up in the morning and be designated as such. No longer are they called “super delegates.” These folks are now “automatic delegates,” as though they are granted divine intervention powers.

In other words, it’s more of the same old, same old. You do not even hear a murmur that this process should be replaced by a national primary.

The conclusion here is pretty simple. If the Democrats think a straight-up election with a winner-take-all outcome in the general election for president is right and good enough for the nation, they ought to at least demonstrate the pretense of the courage of their convictions and apply that standard to themselves.

Until that day comes to pass, Americans will have to accept that their posturing on the Electoral College is just that… posturing.

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

On the roster: What would Buttigieg’s path look like? - As impeachment grinds on, voters dig in - Congress kicks can on spending until Dec. 20 - Audible: Audible, indeed - Three wise guys wanted for questioning



WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

NBCUniversal and parent company Comcast have been accused of multiple abuses of power amid ongoing scandals related to Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, organized an effort for key 2020 Democratic hopefuls to address the issues with DNC chairman Tom Perez through a harshly worded letter obtained by Fox News.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

“We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors,” the letter begins.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network – but UltraViolet has vowed not to give up until an independent investigation is launched.

“NBC’s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault. Yet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable,” the letter said. “That's what allowed the behavior of powerful abusers inside the company to go unchecked. The troubling reports about management’s role to cover up abuse demonstrate that Comcast should have and needs to do more to shift the work culture and pursue significant structural changes in order to prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC. Until that happens, employees are at risk.”

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

UltraViolet has called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and “every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at the Peacock Network. The group has also organized protests outside the network’s New York City headquarters.

“Current and former NBCUniversal employees have courageously put their livelihoods on the line to demand change and accountability. UltraViolet and our 1.2 million members have their backs, and we are proud to say that Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have their backs too,” UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas said.

Oppenheim, who is Lack’s top deputy, has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. He is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

“Everyone on the side of survivors has a role to play in using their influence to push Comcast and NBC to do the right thing. The DNC has leverage as a critical media partner in the 2020 election and they owe it to survivors to use it,” Thomas added.

The letter said Democrats must offer an alternative to President Trump but “can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership.”

The letter, signed by Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren, concludes by saying it is “critical that the Democratic National Committee make clear that they support survivors of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that Comcast and NBC News take steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks.”

Elizabeth Warren's tax plan could create ""catastrophic economic consequences.""

“I don’t think that taxation approaching confiscatory is remotely feasible and, if it was tried, would have catastrophic economic consequences,” Summers, a former president of Harvard University, told CNBC.

Summers, who also was a former director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, was the latest Democrat to express skepticism over proposals pushed by more progressive elements in the party.

“Essentially, what Sen. Warren’s plans would do, as I read them, is they go through every option that has been selected as the possible strategy for raising progressivity and tries to do them all of them at once,” Summers said. ""And when you try to do all of them at once, you're collecting essentially about as much taxes as the total after-tax AGI, adjusted gross income, of all the millionaires.""

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Warren, D-Mass., previously proposed a two percent tax on wealth above $50 million as well as a three percent tax on wealth that surpassed $1 billion. That later changed to six percent after Warren faced questions over how she would pay for her ""Medicare-for-all"" plan -- a massive proposal that conservatives have warned would cost too much and burden the economy.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the rates could vary and make 100 percent tax rates ""typical"" for investment income.

IS ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROPOSED WEALTH TAX LEGAL OR EVEN PRACTICAL?: EXPERT PANEL DEBATES

Summers previously bashed the idea of a wealth tax, arguing in October that Congress and the Supreme Court would likely reject it.

“For progressives to invest their energy in a proposal that the Supreme Court has better than a 50 percent chance of declaring unconstitutional, that has very little chance of passing through the Congress, whose revenue potential is extraordinarily in doubt — for that to be the defining element in the progressive agenda in the United States, it seems to me to potentially sacrifice an immense opportunity,"" he said.

Warren, however, maintains that she can pay for her health plan without raising middle-class taxes. On her website, she claims that her all her tax changes would generate trillions of dollars in revenue over the next decade.

""We can raise another $3 trillion over ten years by asking the top 1 percent of households in America to pay a little more,"" she said. Overall, she projects the cost will total just under $52 trillion."

In a profile of Baquet, The Guardian reported that Baquet told staffers ""the outlet would lose its status if it openly sided with particular politicians."" The piece implied that Baquet had been pressured to approve coverage favorable to Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., but did not provide details.

""They probably want a more political New York Times than I’m willing to give them,"" Baquet said of those staffers. ""I hope they will learn over time that a New York Times that plays it straight has much more power and much more longevity.""

NEW YORK TIMES BANS REPORTERS FROM CNN'S DON LEMON, MSNBC'S MADDOW SHOWS FOR BEING 'TOO PARTISAN'

The Times editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and for president in 2016. The paper has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.

In the same piece, Baquet blasted the president's attacks on his journalists as ""unpresidential"" and equivocated on whether Trump is a racist.

“I think Donald Trump says racially divisive things. I think that’s a little bit different. I’m not in his head enough to know whether he says them because he wants to stoke his base,"" he said.

Baquet's comments appeared to reflect his concern about a widespread perception that the Times is too biased. Vanity Fair previously reported that Baquet expressed concerns that reporters who appeared on certain cable news shows would be ""perceived as being aligned"" with the show's politics.

The interview also offered a glimpse into the Times' leadership as it faced growing criticism and boycotts from both sides of the ideological spectrum. Republicans often accuse the Times of left-wing bias with Trump repeatedly accusing the publication of spreading ""fake news.""

In August, Democrats called out the Times for employing a headline implying Trump opposed racism in a speech following the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. That shooting was prompted, in part, by anti-immigrant sentiment. Although Baquet later criticized the headline about Trump, he told the Guardian that he wasn't in a position to ""know whether he [makes comments] because he is a racist.""

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."

But when it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders' campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,” campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. “This is what momentum looks like.”

Sanders is making his second straight White House run. His campaign highlighted that the candidate didn’t reach the 4 million individuals milestone in the 2016 cycle until after February’s New Hampshire primary, which is still more nearly three months away.

Sanders, though, didn’t announce his 2016 bid until late April 2015. This time around, Sanders launched his presidential campaign in February of 2019, two months ahead of his 2016 schedule.

Sanders – like his progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – is relying on small-dollar grassroots donations to fuel his campaign. He hauled in $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, more than any other Democratic White House hopeful. That haul was powered by some 1.4 million contributions.

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

Reports have indicated the decision to replace “quid pro quo” with “bribery” when speaking of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine’s president came from focus groups conducted in key battleground states. Among the questions asked of people was whether ""quid pro quo,"" ""extortion"" or ""bribery"" was the best description of the president’s alleged conduct. The groups found ""bribery"" to be the most descriptive and ""damning.""

Armed with their talking points, Democrats at the House Intelligence Committee hearing, across the country and on TV programs, began using the word ""bribery."" Listening to some of the montages compiled by conservative media is hilarious. It is straight out of “newspeak” in George Orwell’s novel, “1984,” which the author said was “designed to diminish the range of thought.”

MIKE HUCKABEE: DEMOCRATS' TRUMP IMPEACHMENT THEATRICS A SIGN OF THEIR GROWING DESPERATION — IT'S NOW A PARODY

This represents the death rattle of a party once known for promoting big ideas. Last week, the stock market achieved another record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 28,000, fattening the savings of current and future retirees.

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

While not everyone is invested in the market, when companies make money, they tend to hire more people. It is why unemployment is at record, or near record, lows and the number of employed at record highs. Anyone wanting a job can find one, if they are willing to accept an entry-level position and work hard to move up. Many companies offer education benefits to their employees.

Democrats are desperate to get rid of the president (though the Senate will never convict him), because one more term of prosperity, especially for minorities, who have mostly been tied to their party, could mean a shift in loyalty. If that shift in African-American voters from Democrat to Republican is even as small as 10 percent, Democrats would be doomed in 2020 and possibly beyond.

Success is a better and more motivating theme than envy, greed and entitlement, as promoted by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The Wall Street Journal reported that under Warren’s ""Medicare-for-all"" scheme, some would be taxed above 100 percent and that her proposals are so grandiose her “wealth tax” would fall far short of paying for it all.

Given the poor stewardship of the federal government with the record amounts of tax dollars it already receives, why does anyone believe sending more money to Washington and placing additional tax penalties on successful people would suddenly mean politicians might become fiscally responsible?

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

It’s all a sham and a scam. We hear the same rhetoric every four years, especially about the wealthy and successful needing to pay their “fair share.” Democrats never tell us what they mean by fair, but it appeals to the envy and class warfare their party promotes.

America is a land of opportunity, not guaranteed outcome. There are more opportunities than ever for a good education, good jobs and so many other things that make the country unique.

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.

TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

“The campaigns, of course, are always, shall I say, hot salsa, but the governing part doesn’t need to be that way.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a speech in his home commonwealth of Kentucky decrying the level of vitriol in government.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program. If you can’t handle Tim Alberta for five questions, you darned sure can’t handle the presidency.]



“Lincoln's quintessential address of 156 years ago seems much closer to today when referred to as seven score and 16 years. I agree with your often-stated position that the dearth of humanities in secondary education, especially civics and western civilization, is tearing away the very fabric of our republic - an educated citizenry. Unfortunately, I do not see the education elites embracing the classics and the much-maligned vocational education necessary to sustain our grand experiment.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“It is pure fiction that this pro-American sentiment was either squandered after Sept. 11 or lost under the Bush Administration. It never existed.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 9, 2003.

Here's what you need to know as you start your Wednesday...

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Why don’t Democrats do that?,2019-11-19,Fox News,"David Avella: Democrats want to scrap the Electoral College. So why don't they ditch primaries, too?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-electoral-college-primaries-david-avella,"While South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge in the polls in Iowa, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has consistently shown staying power nationally to remain the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. However, before she declares victory and announces its time to focus on the general election, here is an obvious question for her. If she is so convinced that a national popular vote is how we should elect the president of the United States in the general election, why don't Democrats hold a national primary to select their presidential nominee?

At the core of Warren’s plans for America is the end of the Electoral College. She wants to replace it with a national popular vote.

She is hardly alone among Democrats. Day after day, we are treated to Democrats decrying the Electoral College as being unfair, as being wrong, as being something that gives too much-undeserved power to voters in less populated states.

LIZ PEEK: SCHIFF STEERS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD A DITCH — HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

However, when one examines the arcane and near-mystical process the Democrats have chosen to determine their nominee for president of the United States, one would be hard-pressed to conclude anything other than that Democrats are unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

It would seem to be a pretty simple matter to switch to a national primary where whoever receives the most votes is declared the winner. Why don’t Democrats do that?

One concern could be that with multiple candidates vying for the party’s nomination, one of them could prevail with less than a majority of the votes. That is surely so. Would not that same logic apply to anytime there was a strong third-party candidate?

We did not hear Democrats in 1992, 2000 or any other time arguing that only the votes of the two major-party candidates should count in the presidential tally to ensure the winner has earned a majority of the votes.

In 2016, when Hillary Clinton prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it is pretty clear the Democratic National Committee (DNC) put more than a thumb on the scale to all but assure that she prevailed.

If you go back to the last truly contested race for the Democratic Party nomination, in 2008, the process used might startle you. Suffice it to say, it was a little different than one man, one vote.

Florida and Michigan did not hold their primaries on the days the DNC deemed proper, so their votes were treated in a different fashion than those cast by voters in states bowing to the DNC. They did not even count the popular vote from Michigan (where President Obama did not have his name on the ballot). Eventually, the decision was made to split the delegate vote evenly in these two states, despite Clinton having defeated Obama soundly in Florida where both names were on the ballot.

It gets weirder. Democrats abroad, including those in American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands had delegates who each received a half vote. Would it not just have been easier to have them cut the number of delegates in half?

At the end of the day, if you include the votes cast in Michigan, Hillary Clinton received 48.1 percent and Barack Obama 47.4 percent. Really close.

When delegates selected via primary and caucus were totaled up, neither candidate had enough to win at the convention.

So, just how did the Democrats resolve this tricky and difficult situation? Why, they turned to their consiglieres, otherwise known as super delegates. These are elected officials, party officials, etc.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

In other words, an elitist class established to fix problems when the electorate gets out of hand. The super delegates overwhelmingly sided with Obama, and he became the nominee.

Fast forward to 2020. The Democrats are still holding a series of primaries, conventions, and caucuses. Fully 16 percent of the delegates will do nothing more than wake up in the morning and be designated as such. No longer are they called “super delegates.” These folks are now “automatic delegates,” as though they are granted divine intervention powers.

In other words, it’s more of the same old, same old. You do not even hear a murmur that this process should be replaced by a national primary.

The conclusion here is pretty simple. If the Democrats think a straight-up election with a winner-take-all outcome in the general election for president is right and good enough for the nation, they ought to at least demonstrate the pretense of the courage of their convictions and apply that standard to themselves.

Until that day comes to pass, Americans will have to accept that their posturing on the Electoral College is just that… posturing.

* Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spoke at an event in his home state of Nevada over the weekend and downplayed the importance of the first two 2020 nominating contests. “I don’t think it matters what happens in Iowa or New Hampshire because those states are not representative of the country anymore,” Reid said.

Elizabeth Warren's tax plan could create ""catastrophic economic consequences.""

“I don’t think that taxation approaching confiscatory is remotely feasible and, if it was tried, would have catastrophic economic consequences,” Summers, a former president of Harvard University, told CNBC.

Summers, who also was a former director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, was the latest Democrat to express skepticism over proposals pushed by more progressive elements in the party.

“Essentially, what Sen. Warren’s plans would do, as I read them, is they go through every option that has been selected as the possible strategy for raising progressivity and tries to do them all of them at once,” Summers said. ""And when you try to do all of them at once, you're collecting essentially about as much taxes as the total after-tax AGI, adjusted gross income, of all the millionaires.""

Warren, D-Mass., previously proposed a two percent tax on wealth above $50 million as well as a three percent tax on wealth that surpassed $1 billion. That later changed to six percent after Warren faced questions over how she would pay for her ""Medicare-for-all"" plan -- a massive proposal that conservatives have warned would cost too much and burden the economy.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the rates could vary and make 100 percent tax rates ""typical"" for investment income.

IS ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROPOSED WEALTH TAX LEGAL OR EVEN PRACTICAL?: EXPERT PANEL DEBATES

Summers previously bashed the idea of a wealth tax, arguing in October that Congress and the Supreme Court would likely reject it.

“For progressives to invest their energy in a proposal that the Supreme Court has better than a 50 percent chance of declaring unconstitutional, that has very little chance of passing through the Congress, whose revenue potential is extraordinarily in doubt — for that to be the defining element in the progressive agenda in the United States, it seems to me to potentially sacrifice an immense opportunity,"" he said.

Warren, however, maintains that she can pay for her health plan without raising middle-class taxes. On her website, she claims that her all her tax changes would generate trillions of dollars in revenue over the next decade.

""We can raise another $3 trillion over ten years by asking the top 1 percent of households in America to pay a little more,"" she said. Overall, she projects the cost will total just under $52 trillion."

The Times editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and for president in 2016. The paper has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.

In the same piece, Baquet blasted the president's attacks on his journalists as ""unpresidential"" and equivocated on whether Trump is a racist.

“I think Donald Trump says racially divisive things. I think that’s a little bit different. I’m not in his head enough to know whether he says them because he wants to stoke his base,"" he said.

Baquet's comments appeared to reflect his concern about a widespread perception that the Times is too biased. Vanity Fair previously reported that Baquet expressed concerns that reporters who appeared on certain cable news shows would be ""perceived as being aligned"" with the show's politics.

The interview also offered a glimpse into the Times' leadership as it faced growing criticism and boycotts from both sides of the ideological spectrum. Republicans often accuse the Times of left-wing bias with Trump repeatedly accusing the publication of spreading ""fake news.""

In August, Democrats called out the Times for employing a headline implying Trump opposed racism in a speech following the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. That shooting was prompted, in part, by anti-immigrant sentiment. Although Baquet later criticized the headline about Trump, he told the Guardian that he wasn't in a position to ""know whether he [makes comments] because he is a racist.""

Langone also said it's human nature for others to be jealous of people's success and claimed he's been mischaracterized by those who envy his wealth.

""Human nature is alive and well. And one of the seven deadly sins is envy,"" he said.

In Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, Warren continued to tout her plans to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, arguing that she is not trying to punish the rich.

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

The late entrant into the 2020 Democratic race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick not only didn’t make the debate stage he also canceled an event he organized at Morehouse College in Atlanta, the site of the debate, when only two people showed up."

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

“On the one hand, it featured a fantastic all-woman moderation team, and on the other, it was hosted by a media company with serious problems related to workplace sexual assault and harassment,” UltraViolet Action co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.

NBC MUST CLEAN UP ‘TOXIC CULTURE,’ 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEMAND AHEAD OF MSNBC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

“This debate was also defined by what was not addressed: workplace sexual abuse, and the fact that MSNBC, and its parent company Comcast/NBC Universal, have a serious problem with silencing survivors, enabling abuse, and creating a culture of impunity where employees were simply unsafe,” Thomas added.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, former Vice President Joe Biden missed an opportunity to bring attention to the issue during MSNBC’s debate.

“The #MeToo movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take, early in your administration, to address this problem?” NBC News' White House correspondent Kristen Welker asked Biden, setting up the 2020 presidential hopeful to call for changes at the Peacock Network.

The former vice president, who was not among the five candidates to sign a harshly worded letter demanding parent company Comcast to “prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC,” had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network but ultimately went a different direction.

MATT LAUER, NBC’S ‘TOXIC CULTURE’ LOOM OVER MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said “the culture of how women are treated” needs to change before repeatedly saying we need to keep “punching” at domestic violence. He appeared to believe that the #MeToo movement is focused on domestic violence, as opposed to sexual assault and harassment.

“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman, in anger, other than in self-defense… we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” Biden said as he punched the air, drawing a snicker from the audience.

“No, I really mean it,” Biden said, apparently unaware of the irony that evoked the laughter.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Earlier this week, Tom Steyer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its “toxic culture” after a series of sexual harassment scandals related to Weinstein and Lauer.

UltraViolet helped putting the letter together and said Biden was invited to partake but ultimately didn’t sign it.

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct. UltraViolet’s letter called on parent company Comcast to step in and “conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at NBC.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

But the message apparently fell on deaf ears and Lack dodged the subject when approached by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple backstage during the debate.

Wemple, who attended the debate and bumped into Lack backstage, said he assumed the NBC News boss would “want to express his confidence in NBC News’s efforts to date” or even blow off some steam.

“Not so fast,” Wemple wrote, adding that Lack quickly shut down questions about conducting an investigation.

“I don’t have anything to say about it. . . . I don’t know much about it,” Lack told Wemple.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC’s high-level executives doesn’t think the network will take action anytime soon.

“Andy Lack is the Rasputin of network news. He has [NBC Universal CEO Steve] Burke and [Comcast CEO] Roberts so wrapped around his finger that God himself couldn’t force an independent investigation — which Andy knows would certainly result in his ouster,” the insider told Fox News."

“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

“Only you would ask that,” Biden said. “You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy.”

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKED AFTER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE TRUMP’S PHONE THEORY WITH CALL TO MOM FAILS

DNA tests reportedly confirm ""with scientific certainty"" that Hunter Biden is the father, according to court documents filed in Arkansas on Wednesday.

In a motion to partially seal information about the baby from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to him or her should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

MEDIA'S ‘CLUMSY HANDLING’ OF BOTCHED REPORT ATTRIBUTING OBAMA-ERA STATS TO TRUMP BLASTED BY CRITICS

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October. Wednesday's court filings said Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

This isn’t the first time Biden found an issue with Doocy’s questions on the campaign trail.

Back in August, Doocy issued a live fact check when Biden claimed to reporters that he drew larger crowds than other Democratic candidates.

""What I'm trying to do is go around from town to town and I'm drawing as big of crowds, or bigger than anybody,"" Biden said. ""Have you seen anybody draw bigger crowds than me in this state?""

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

""Yes,"" Doocy responded before noting that he saw a bigger crowd for Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she visited Des Moines in January.

""The vice president didn't seem to like that because a few minutes later he singled me out,"" Doocy explained, saying Biden referred to himself as a “big boy” during an exchange.

In September, Biden stuck his finger in Doocy’s face and told him to “ask the right questions” when the reporter attempted to get a comment on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

Reports have indicated the decision to replace “quid pro quo” with “bribery” when speaking of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine’s president came from focus groups conducted in key battleground states. Among the questions asked of people was whether ""quid pro quo,"" ""extortion"" or ""bribery"" was the best description of the president’s alleged conduct. The groups found ""bribery"" to be the most descriptive and ""damning.""

Armed with their talking points, Democrats at the House Intelligence Committee hearing, across the country and on TV programs, began using the word ""bribery."" Listening to some of the montages compiled by conservative media is hilarious. It is straight out of “newspeak” in George Orwell’s novel, “1984,” which the author said was “designed to diminish the range of thought.”

MIKE HUCKABEE: DEMOCRATS' TRUMP IMPEACHMENT THEATRICS A SIGN OF THEIR GROWING DESPERATION — IT'S NOW A PARODY

This represents the death rattle of a party once known for promoting big ideas. Last week, the stock market achieved another record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 28,000, fattening the savings of current and future retirees.

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

While not everyone is invested in the market, when companies make money, they tend to hire more people. It is why unemployment is at record, or near record, lows and the number of employed at record highs. Anyone wanting a job can find one, if they are willing to accept an entry-level position and work hard to move up. Many companies offer education benefits to their employees.

Democrats are desperate to get rid of the president (though the Senate will never convict him), because one more term of prosperity, especially for minorities, who have mostly been tied to their party, could mean a shift in loyalty. If that shift in African-American voters from Democrat to Republican is even as small as 10 percent, Democrats would be doomed in 2020 and possibly beyond.

Success is a better and more motivating theme than envy, greed and entitlement, as promoted by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The Wall Street Journal reported that under Warren’s ""Medicare-for-all"" scheme, some would be taxed above 100 percent and that her proposals are so grandiose her “wealth tax” would fall far short of paying for it all.

Given the poor stewardship of the federal government with the record amounts of tax dollars it already receives, why does anyone believe sending more money to Washington and placing additional tax penalties on successful people would suddenly mean politicians might become fiscally responsible?

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

It’s all a sham and a scam. We hear the same rhetoric every four years, especially about the wealthy and successful needing to pay their “fair share.” Democrats never tell us what they mean by fair, but it appeals to the envy and class warfare their party promotes.

America is a land of opportunity, not guaranteed outcome. There are more opportunities than ever for a good education, good jobs and so many other things that make the country unique.

On Wednesday evening, 10 Democratic candidates for president will stand on the stage for the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta.

On Fox Nation's ""My Take,"" Varney said that the Democratic field is not generating any of the excitement that the 2016 Republican primary debates produced.

""Who could forget the Republican debates four years ago? Riveting for one reason -- candidate Donald J. Trump. Legendary insults and put-downs. Republicans and Democrats alike glued. The TV ratings actually went up because everyone wanted to know what he would say next. What zinger would be unleashed? Political debate became must-see viewing,"" he said.

""Fast forward to the Democrat debates this year,"" Varney continued. ""Oh, what a difference. Viewers are already turning off. Between the first debate in June and the one last month, the TV audience was actually cut in half. There's no Trump in these debates. There's no standout character, no sharp questioning either. It's boring.""

According to Nielsen Media Research, the fourth debate of the Democratic primary season drew 8.3 million viewers, making it the second-least watched debate of the cycle. The most-watched primary debate was in August 2015, when more than 24 million viewers watched a Republican primary debate in Cleveland on the Fox News Channel.

""Ten candidates on the stage tonight, six more who didn't qualify. Bloomberg - he's not going to be there, nor will [former Mass., governor] Deval Patrick -- not there. But it's a very crowded field. They really need to narrow it down. And they haven't found a way to do it yet. And they're miles apart on policy. They are split,"" observed Varney.

Varney argued that Donald Trump made the difference on the Republican side four years ago, but Democrats lack the star power.

""Donald Trump really did upend the Republican Party. His debate performance crushed the Republican establishment and his go for the throat policies brought a raft of new voters to his party.""

""Perhaps the Democrats believe a socialist like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders can similarly upend their party or that the moderates can somehow make a dramatic comeback. Dream on!"" he concluded. ""If you can't get people to watch, if you are already boring your supporters, you're in bad shape.""

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.



THE RULEBOOK: BIG BOSS MAN

TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program.

I agree with your often-stated position that the dearth of humanities in secondary education, especially civics and western civilization, is tearing away the very fabric of our republic - an educated citizenry. Unfortunately, I do not see the education elites embracing the classics and the much-maligned vocational education necessary to sustain our grand experiment.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“It is pure fiction that this pro-American sentiment was either squandered after Sept. 11 or lost under the Bush Administration. It never existed.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 9, 2003.

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Bribery. Contempt of Congress. Obstruction of justice.

Those are the four potential articles of impeachment that House Judiciary Committee Democrats could draw up against President Trump as soon as next month, Fox News is told, after all scheduled public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up on a testy note Thursday.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

It remained possible the House Intelligence Committee could schedule more hearings, although no additional hearings are expected during Thanksgiving week. Or, the committee could prepare a report on its findings for the House Judiciary Committee -- which would have the option of holding its own hearings or simply drafting articles of impeachment outright.

Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such hearings. But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

Graham, coming out of the White House discussion, added that ""we didn't talk about"" how to mount a case to ""defend the president.""

Instead, Graham said, the discussion centered around ""how would the trial start -- you know, they'll make a request for witnesses, but that would have to be granted by the Senate, I guess that's the way we did it before.""

Graham continued, ""My preference was to try to follow the Clinton model as much as possible.""

Clinton was acquitted on both perjury and obstruction counts in February 1999, with each vote falling fall short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.

In the Senate, impeachment procedures would allow witnesses to be called by the president's defense lawyers, GOP senators and a team of House Democrats who essentially would serve as prosecutors. The big catch: Republicans would need enough votes from the 53 GOP senators to muster a majority and prevent Democrats from blocking them.

Assuming Republican senators would stay united -- not a guarantee -- Trump's defenders could try refocusing the inquiry by seeking testimony from people like Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint touching off the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

Hunter Biden held that lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. If Senate Republicans could put forward evidence showing the president's concerns about the Bidens' potential corruption were legitimate, they could undercut Democrats' central argument for impeachment.

On Thursday, Graham strongly signaled that Hunter Biden would be a key GOP focus. He sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents ""related to contacts between Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.""

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified behind closed doors last month that he and other officials had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma at the time.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

""What Republicans want to do is broaden the story,"" said David Hoppe, who was chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's impeachment trial.

And, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Thursday he'd like Senate testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose House appearance Democrats have blocked. Cramer said he might also like to hear from both Bidens and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

The White House has signaled it will mount an aggressive defense. ""When this goes over to the Senate, you know, the people that actually started this thing, they are going to be put on the stand,"" Eric Trump, the president's son, told reporters Thursday. He said that would include ""heads of the Democratic Party.""

For his part, Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration.""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

* It looked to me like voters learned quite a bit during last night’s Democratic presidential primary debate.

* For the second time this week, a poll out of Iowa offers good news for Pete Buttigieg: a new Iowa State University poll found the former mayor leading the Democrats’ presidential field with 26%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 19%. Bernie Sanders is a very close third with 18% followed by Joe Biden at 12%.

* In New York, a new Siena College poll found Biden leading Warren among Democratic voters, 24% to 14%, with the former vice president’s support fueled in large part by African-American support. Sanders is a close third with 13% in the poll.

* Google announced changes to its policy on microtargeted advertising yesterday. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Under the new policy, political ads can only be targeted based on users’ age, gender, and location at the postal-code level. Political advertisers will also still be able to display ads based on the content of the page a user is viewing. Advertisers would no longer be able to target political ads based on users’ interests inferred from browsing or search history.”

* And Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., ended a longshot presidential campaign yesterday. By my count, that still leaves 17 Democratic presidential candidates in the party’s 2020 field."

DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

“In re: Monday's podcast: you're totally correct about it being too early for Christmas music, and I share your love of good Advent hymns. You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is a ""phony and a liar"" looking to paint wealthy people as the enemy, said billionaire and GOP donor Ken Langone on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday, before calling on her to make her charitable donations public.

""They can call me whatever they want. I still go to work every day... What I am is a grateful American,"" he said. ""What happened to me in my life only happened because my grandparents came to America. She can call me whatever she wants. She's phony. She's a liar, we know that. We know she's a liar, a horrible liar.""

The Home Depot co-founder and philanthropist said Warren's candidacy is being propped up by the media and claimed her millionaire status makes her a hypocrite.

""She's been created by the media,"" he said. ""She's worth $18 million... I don’t want to see her tax returns, it'd make me sick because she does nothing to make it. All I'd like to see is how much money have she and her husband given to charity over the years, as a percentage of their income or as a percentage of their net worth.""

Langone also said it's human nature for others to be jealous of people's success and claimed he's been mischaracterized by those who envy his wealth.

""Human nature is alive and well. And one of the seven deadly sins is envy,"" he said. ""Part of what happens to somebody like me that becomes successful, very successful, my old man used to say to me, 'You want to be successful, but not too successful.' This is an 8th-grade education man, OK? He had wisdom beyond his words.

""That's part of the price,"" Langone added. ""That's OK. People want to think that I've made my money by ripping them off. -- people want to think that I've exploited people? I can’t stop that.""

In Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, Warren continued to tout her plans to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, arguing that she is not trying to punish the rich.

""It's about saying you built something great in this country? Good for you, but you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate, you did it getting your goods using roads and bridges all of us helped pay for,"" she said."

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

After the candidates left the stage, progressive author and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson -- who didn't qualify for Wednesday's debate -- tweeted simply, ""Miss me?

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

Why MSNBC’s Democratic debate made no news,https://www.foxnews.com/media/forgotten-why-msnbcs-democratic-debate-made-no-news,"After a nearly 11-hour hearing on impeaching President Trump, MSNBC and the Washington Post hosted a Democratic debate where the leadoff topic was…impeaching President Trump.

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. He understands our immigration problems are being caused by the wrong policies, not by the people who enforce those policies.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

“On the one hand, it featured a fantastic all-woman moderation team, and on the other, it was hosted by a media company with serious problems related to workplace sexual assault and harassment,” UltraViolet Action co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.

NBC MUST CLEAN UP ‘TOXIC CULTURE,’ 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEMAND AHEAD OF MSNBC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

“This debate was also defined by what was not addressed: workplace sexual abuse, and the fact that MSNBC, and its parent company Comcast/NBC Universal, have a serious problem with silencing survivors, enabling abuse, and creating a culture of impunity where employees were simply unsafe,” Thomas added.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, former Vice President Joe Biden missed an opportunity to bring attention to the issue during MSNBC’s debate.

“The #MeToo movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take, early in your administration, to address this problem?” NBC News' White House correspondent Kristen Welker asked Biden, setting up the 2020 presidential hopeful to call for changes at the Peacock Network.

The former vice president, who was not among the five candidates to sign a harshly worded letter demanding parent company Comcast to “prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC,” had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network but ultimately went a different direction.

MATT LAUER, NBC’S ‘TOXIC CULTURE’ LOOM OVER MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said “the culture of how women are treated” needs to change before repeatedly saying we need to keep “punching” at domestic violence. He appeared to believe that the #MeToo movement is focused on domestic violence, as opposed to sexual assault and harassment.

“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman, in anger, other than in self-defense… we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” Biden said as he punched the air, drawing a snicker from the audience.

“No, I really mean it,” Biden said, apparently unaware of the irony that evoked the laughter.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Earlier this week, Tom Steyer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its “toxic culture” after a series of sexual harassment scandals related to Weinstein and Lauer.

UltraViolet helped putting the letter together and said Biden was invited to partake but ultimately didn’t sign it.

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct. UltraViolet’s letter called on parent company Comcast to step in and “conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at NBC.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

But the message apparently fell on deaf ears and Lack dodged the subject when approached by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple backstage during the debate.

Wemple, who attended the debate and bumped into Lack backstage, said he assumed the NBC News boss would “want to express his confidence in NBC News’s efforts to date” or even blow off some steam.

“Not so fast,” Wemple wrote, adding that Lack quickly shut down questions about conducting an investigation.

“I don’t have anything to say about it. . . . I don’t know much about it,” Lack told Wemple.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC’s high-level executives doesn’t think the network will take action anytime soon.

“Andy Lack is the Rasputin of network news. He has [NBC Universal CEO Steve] Burke and [Comcast CEO] Roberts so wrapped around his finger that God himself couldn’t force an independent investigation — which Andy knows would certainly result in his ouster,” the insider told Fox News."

“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

“Only you would ask that,” Biden said. “You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy.”

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKED AFTER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE TRUMP’S PHONE THEORY WITH CALL TO MOM FAILS

DNA tests reportedly confirm ""with scientific certainty"" that Hunter Biden is the father, according to court documents filed in Arkansas on Wednesday.

In a motion to partially seal information about the baby from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to him or her should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

MEDIA'S ‘CLUMSY HANDLING’ OF BOTCHED REPORT ATTRIBUTING OBAMA-ERA STATS TO TRUMP BLASTED BY CRITICS

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October. Wednesday's court filings said Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

This isn’t the first time Biden found an issue with Doocy’s questions on the campaign trail.

Back in August, Doocy issued a live fact check when Biden claimed to reporters that he drew larger crowds than other Democratic candidates.

""What I'm trying to do is go around from town to town and I'm drawing as big of crowds, or bigger than anybody,"" Biden said. ""Have you seen anybody draw bigger crowds than me in this state?""

""Yes,"" Doocy responded before noting that he saw a bigger crowd for Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she visited Des Moines in January.

""The vice president didn't seem to like that because a few minutes later he singled me out,"" Doocy explained, saying Biden referred to himself as a “big boy” during an exchange.

In September, Biden stuck his finger in Doocy’s face and told him to “ask the right questions” when the reporter attempted to get a comment on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

On Wednesday evening, 10 Democratic candidates for president will stand on the stage for the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta.

On Fox Nation's ""My Take,"" Varney said that the Democratic field is not generating any of the excitement that the 2016 Republican primary debates produced.

""Who could forget the Republican debates four years ago? Riveting for one reason -- candidate Donald J. Trump. Legendary insults and put-downs. Republicans and Democrats alike glued. The TV ratings actually went up because everyone wanted to know what he would say next. What zinger would be unleashed? Political debate became must-see viewing,"" he said.

""Fast forward to the Democrat debates this year,"" Varney continued. ""Oh, what a difference. Viewers are already turning off. Between the first debate in June and the one last month, the TV audience was actually cut in half. There's no Trump in these debates. There's no standout character, no sharp questioning either. It's boring.""

According to Nielsen Media Research, the fourth debate of the Democratic primary season drew 8.3 million viewers, making it the second-least watched debate of the cycle. The most-watched primary debate was in August 2015, when more than 24 million viewers watched a Republican primary debate in Cleveland on the Fox News Channel.

""Ten candidates on the stage tonight, six more who didn't qualify. Bloomberg - he's not going to be there, nor will [former Mass., governor] Deval Patrick -- not there. But it's a very crowded field. They really need to narrow it down. And they haven't found a way to do it yet. And they're miles apart on policy. They are split,"" observed Varney.

Varney argued that Donald Trump made the difference on the Republican side four years ago, but Democrats lack the star power.

""Donald Trump really did upend the Republican Party. His debate performance crushed the Republican establishment and his go for the throat policies brought a raft of new voters to his party.""

""Perhaps the Democrats believe a socialist like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders can similarly upend their party or that the moderates can somehow make a dramatic comeback. Dream on!"" he concluded. ""If you can't get people to watch, if you are already boring your supporters, you're in bad shape.""

Members of the #YangGang were seen chanting ""M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!"" at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, the site of the Democrats' fifth debate.

Yang received the least amount of speaking time of the 10 participants on the debate stage with 6:48, roughly half of the time Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received. Yang also did not receive a question from the moderators until 32 minutes into the debate.

The hashtags #YangMediaBlackout and #MSNBCFearsYang made waves on social media.

YANG CAMPAIGN RIPS MSNBC'S APOLOGY AFTER NETWORK SNUBBED HIM FROM POLLING GRAPHIC 'FOR THE 15TH TIME'

MSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Yang knocked MSNBC during an interview Thursday.

""America saw it. I went 32 minutes without a question and I was raising my hand trying to get a word in edgewise during that time,” Yang said.

Yang's White House bid has exceeded many expectations on the campaign trail. In a recent Iowa poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register, the entrepreneur reached 3 percent support, tying him with Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

However, in an on-air graphic of that poll, Yang was missing from the roster -- even though it included former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who polled at 2 percent, and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., at 1 percent.

""Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)?"" political commentator Ian Bremmer asked Sunday. ""This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip-up. Unacceptable.""

MSNBC offered an apology to Yang later Sunday, claiming it ""inadvertently"" left him off the graphic and shared a graphic that included him as well as the several candidates who had polled at zero percent.

The Yang campaign didn't seem to welcome the apology.

""Thank you @MSNBC, for making this apology for the 15th time. The #YangGang is very excited for #16,"" Yang campaign manager Zach Graumann reacted.

Writer and vocal Yang supporter Scott Santens previously documented every instance in which MSNBC or CNN left the tech businessman off a graphic.

Between MSNBC, NBC News and NBC digital platforms, Santens' thread included 15 other instances depicting Yang's absence dating back to June. CNN had at least five instances as well."

The field of 2020 candidates is one of the largest in history. Pretty much everybody seems to be running, from the former vice president of the United States to some guy who is literally the mayor of South Bend, which, in case you're wondering, is the fourth biggest city in the state of Indiana. It's smaller than Evansville, but it's slightly larger than Carmel. That guy's running for president.

There are an awful lot of people in this race. And yet the ideological range they're allowed is strikingly narrow. -- Everyone's required to have pretty much exactly the same views on everything. Anyone who dissents, even a little bit, is immediately denounced as immoral or racist or an agent of Russia.

BIDEN HECKLED OVER OBAMA-ERA DEPORTATIONS, TELLS PROTESTER 'YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP'

In other words, the Democratic primary race is very much like everything else the left touches. It's strident; it's intolerant. It's almost unbelievably dumb.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is one of the very few willing to challenge the status quo. She's no conservative, of course; she's liberal. But she regularly criticizes her party for becoming reflexively pro-war and pro-corporate monopoly. She did it again Wednesday night during the Democratic primary debate.



Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii: Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military-industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.

Oh. Spoken like an old fashioned liberal. There is one left, but things have changed in the rest of the party. Talk like this is a threat to the private equity community, which is now the core of the Democratic Party. So, their chief toady, Kamala Harris, immediately leaped forth to shut it down.

Kamala Harris: I think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama --

Gabbard: That is ridiculous, Senator -- that's ridiculous...

Harris: -- Who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party.

You often hear Democrats claim Donald Trump divides America. Okay, well, they want to unite it.

Well, one way to unite the country would be making an effort to speak to everyone who lives in the country. But that's literally not allowed. The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

We have more clips from Wednesday night's debate, but we can tell you now the most important things were never mentioned. One word, for example, nobody mentioned Wednesday night was suicide. And yet suicide has risen by more than a third since 1999.

Life expectancy wasn't mentioned either. It's been dropping for the last three years.

Illegal drugs are only mentioned when they told us the war on drugs is racist, and marijuana needs to be legalized. The rest of it ignored.

Prescription drug companies were attacked, but only for charging too much for their products, not for getting Americans hooked on opioids. The drugs that have fueled the deadliest wave of overdose deaths in the history of this country -- 70,000 people last year -- not mentioned.

The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

Democrats did talk about opportunity and inequality, but mostly in racial terms.

Everything for them is in racial terms, of course. Some groups are well off because of their skin color, they told us, while others are not; they're oppressed. America is a racist country they argued again and again and again.

But the truth, if you live here, is that opportunity in America is vanishing for almost everyone -- of all colors. In 1970, for example, 92 percent of 30-year-olds made more money than their parents had at that age. In 2014, only half did. Those are actual numbers that tell you a lot. They're not race-based numbers. They're numbers that tell you that the American dream is in peril. Add to that far higher debt levels and most young people, in the end, are economically worse off than their parents were at the exact same age.

So, opportunity is in decline, and that's a huge problem. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is this: big business has supported open borders with the rest of the world in order to keep wages down.

We don't even know how many illegal immigrants live in this country. We can't even guess to within the nearest million. The best guess, as of right now, is about 22 million people. Tens of thousands more arrive every month.

Democrats don't want to talk about this. On Wednesday night, they never mentioned fixing it. In fact, they pledged to tear down border walls we already have. Can you imagine?

Instead of helping young Americans to have the families they say they want -- and young people say they want to have families but can't afford it -- no Democrat addressed that. Instead, Elizabeth Warren talked about expanding abortion as an ""economic right.""

And that really does sort of sum up perfectly the 2020 Democratic Party. You're poorer and sadder than your parents were but at least the abortion is free.

Hope you're psyched about that.

According to reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, Lack and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim were directly implicated in the stonewalling of Farrow's harrowing report on Weinstein's sexual predation and discovered that the disgraced film mogul was trying to leverage Lauer's own scandal over the network.

Amid the fallout of Farrow's reporting, there had been growing calls for NBC News to conduct an outside investigation into the allegations surrounding Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. Earlier this week, presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its ""toxic culture,"" ahead of Wednesday night's MSNBC debate.

Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple recalled his encounter with the NBC executive backstage at the MSNBC-hosted debate Wednesday night and saw his opportunity to ""pounce.""

""Given all that activity, surely Lack would want to express his confidence in NBC News's efforts to date, to repudiate Farrow’s reporting and/or to let off some righteous steam? Not so fast,"" Wemple wrote.

Wemple wrote that Lack ""dodged"" his questions about the growing calls for an outside investigation.

""I don't have anything to say about it. ... I don't know much about it,"" Lack said. ""Good to see you.""

After another attempt to get a response, Lack told Wemple, ""I don't really have anything to say about it. I'm here, got a great debate going, so I'll let you go.""

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network when asked about how he would carry on the #MeToo movement as president at the MSNBC debate, but he ultimately went a different direction.

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said ""the culture of how women are treated"" needed to change before saying, ""We have to... keep punching"" at domestic violence.

""No, I really mean it,"" Biden said, apparently unaware of what evoked the laughter.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC's high-level executives didn't think the network would take action anytime soon.

Bribery. Contempt of Congress. Obstruction of justice.

Those are the four potential articles of impeachment that House Judiciary Committee Democrats could draw up against President Trump as soon as next month, Fox News is told, after all scheduled public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up on a testy note Thursday.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

It remained possible the House Intelligence Committee could schedule more hearings, although no additional hearings are expected during Thanksgiving week. Or, the committee could prepare a report on its findings for the House Judiciary Committee -- which would have the option of holding its own hearings or simply drafting articles of impeachment outright.

Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such hearings. But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

Graham, coming out of the White House discussion, added that ""we didn't talk about"" how to mount a case to ""defend the president.""

Instead, Graham said, the discussion centered around ""how would the trial start -- you know, they'll make a request for witnesses, but that would have to be granted by the Senate, I guess that's the way we did it before.""

Graham continued, ""My preference was to try to follow the Clinton model as much as possible.""

Clinton was acquitted on both perjury and obstruction counts in February 1999, with each vote falling fall short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.

In the Senate, impeachment procedures would allow witnesses to be called by the president's defense lawyers, GOP senators and a team of House Democrats who essentially would serve as prosecutors. The big catch: Republicans would need enough votes from the 53 GOP senators to muster a majority and prevent Democrats from blocking them.

Assuming Republican senators would stay united -- not a guarantee -- Trump's defenders could try refocusing the inquiry by seeking testimony from people like Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint touching off the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

Hunter Biden held that lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. If Senate Republicans could put forward evidence showing the president's concerns about the Bidens' potential corruption were legitimate, they could undercut Democrats' central argument for impeachment.

On Thursday, Graham strongly signaled that Hunter Biden would be a key GOP focus. He sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents ""related to contacts between Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.""

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified behind closed doors last month that he and other officials had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma at the time.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

""What Republicans want to do is broaden the story,"" said David Hoppe, who was chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's impeachment trial.

And, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Thursday he'd like Senate testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose House appearance Democrats have blocked. Cramer said he might also like to hear from both Bidens and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

The White House has signaled it will mount an aggressive defense. ""When this goes over to the Senate, you know, the people that actually started this thing, they are going to be put on the stand,"" Eric Trump, the president's son, told reporters Thursday. He said that would include ""heads of the Democratic Party.""

For his part, Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration.""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

“In re: Monday's podcast: you're totally correct about it being too early for Christmas music, and I share your love of good Advent hymns. You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

Why MSNBC’s Democratic debate made no news,https://www.foxnews.com/media/forgotten-why-msnbcs-democratic-debate-made-no-news,"After a nearly 11-hour hearing on impeaching President Trump, MSNBC and the Washington Post hosted a Democratic debate where the leadoff topic was…impeaching President Trump.

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

Her comments came just after a Democratic primary debate in which Booker, D-N.J., took on top-tier candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden. Booker also touted his understanding of black voters, saying “I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18.""

According to RealClearPolitics' polling average, Booker has 1.3 percent of support for the Democratic nomination. He typically polls among the top 10 candidates but lags behind several other Democrats.

Members of the #YangGang were seen chanting ""M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!"" at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, the site of the Democrats' fifth debate.

Yang received the least amount of speaking time of the 10 participants on the debate stage with 6:48, roughly half of the time Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received. Yang also did not receive a question from the moderators until 32 minutes into the debate.

The hashtags #YangMediaBlackout and #MSNBCFearsYang made waves on social media.

YANG CAMPAIGN RIPS MSNBC'S APOLOGY AFTER NETWORK SNUBBED HIM FROM POLLING GRAPHIC 'FOR THE 15TH TIME'

MSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Yang knocked MSNBC during an interview Thursday.

""America saw it. I went 32 minutes without a question and I was raising my hand trying to get a word in edgewise during that time,” Yang said.

Yang's White House bid has exceeded many expectations on the campaign trail. In a recent Iowa poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register, the entrepreneur reached 3 percent support, tying him with Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

However, in an on-air graphic of that poll, Yang was missing from the roster -- even though it included former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who polled at 2 percent, and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., at 1 percent.

""Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)?"" political commentator Ian Bremmer asked Sunday. ""This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip-up. Unacceptable.""

MSNBC offered an apology to Yang later Sunday, claiming it ""inadvertently"" left him off the graphic and shared a graphic that included him as well as the several candidates who had polled at zero percent.

The Yang campaign didn't seem to welcome the apology.

""Thank you @MSNBC, for making this apology for the 15th time. The #YangGang is very excited for #16,"" Yang campaign manager Zach Graumann reacted.

Writer and vocal Yang supporter Scott Santens previously documented every instance in which MSNBC or CNN left the tech businessman off a graphic.

The field of 2020 candidates is one of the largest in history. Pretty much everybody seems to be running, from the former vice president of the United States to some guy who is literally the mayor of South Bend, which, in case you're wondering, is the fourth biggest city in the state of Indiana. It's smaller than Evansville, but it's slightly larger than Carmel. That guy's running for president.

There are an awful lot of people in this race. And yet the ideological range they're allowed is strikingly narrow. -- Everyone's required to have pretty much exactly the same views on everything.

BIDEN HECKLED OVER OBAMA-ERA DEPORTATIONS, TELLS PROTESTER 'YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP'

In other words, the Democratic primary race is very much like everything else the left touches. It's strident; it's intolerant. It's almost unbelievably dumb.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is one of the very few willing to challenge the status quo. She's no conservative, of course; she's liberal. But she regularly criticizes her party for becoming reflexively pro-war and pro-corporate monopoly. She did it again Wednesday night during the Democratic primary debate.



Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii: Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military-industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.

Oh. Spoken like an old fashioned liberal. There is one left, but things have changed in the rest of the party. Talk like this is a threat to the private equity community, which is now the core of the Democratic Party. So, their chief toady, Kamala Harris, immediately leaped forth to shut it down.

Gabbard: That is ridiculous, Senator -- that's ridiculous...

Harris: -- Who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party.

You often hear Democrats claim Donald Trump divides America. Okay, well, they want to unite it.

Well, one way to unite the country would be making an effort to speak to everyone who lives in the country. But that's literally not allowed. The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

We have more clips from Wednesday night's debate, but we can tell you now the most important things were never mentioned. One word, for example, nobody mentioned Wednesday night was suicide. And yet suicide has risen by more than a third since 1999.

Life expectancy wasn't mentioned either. It's been dropping for the last three years.

Illegal drugs are only mentioned when they told us the war on drugs is racist, and marijuana needs to be legalized. The rest of it ignored.

Prescription drug companies were attacked, but only for charging too much for their products, not for getting Americans hooked on opioids. The drugs that have fueled the deadliest wave of overdose deaths in the history of this country -- 70,000 people last year -- not mentioned.

The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

Democrats did talk about opportunity and inequality, but mostly in racial terms.

Everything for them is in racial terms, of course. Some groups are well off because of their skin color, they told us, while others are not; they're oppressed. America is a racist country they argued again and again and again.

But the truth, if you live here, is that opportunity in America is vanishing for almost everyone -- of all colors. In 1970, for example, 92 percent of 30-year-olds made more money than their parents had at that age. In 2014, only half did. Those are actual numbers that tell you a lot. They're not race-based numbers. They're numbers that tell you that the American dream is in peril. Add to that far higher debt levels and most young people, in the end, are economically worse off than their parents were at the exact same age.

So, opportunity is in decline, and that's a huge problem. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is this: big business has supported open borders with the rest of the world in order to keep wages down.

We don't even know how many illegal immigrants live in this country. We can't even guess to within the nearest million. The best guess, as of right now, is about 22 million people. Tens of thousands more arrive every month.

Democrats don't want to talk about this. On Wednesday night, they never mentioned fixing it. In fact, they pledged to tear down border walls we already have. Can you imagine?

Instead of helping young Americans to have the families they say they want -- and young people say they want to have families but can't afford it -- no Democrat addressed that. Instead, Elizabeth Warren talked about expanding abortion as an ""economic right.""

And that really does sort of sum up perfectly the 2020 Democratic Party. You're poorer and sadder than your parents were but at least the abortion is free.

Hope you're psyched about that.

According to reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, Lack and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim were directly implicated in the stonewalling of Farrow's harrowing report on Weinstein's sexual predation and discovered that the disgraced film mogul was trying to leverage Lauer's own scandal over the network.

Amid the fallout of Farrow's reporting, there had been growing calls for NBC News to conduct an outside investigation into the allegations surrounding Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. Earlier this week, presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its ""toxic culture,"" ahead of Wednesday night's MSNBC debate.

""Given all that activity, surely Lack would want to express his confidence in NBC News's efforts to date, to repudiate Farrow’s reporting and/or to let off some righteous steam? Not so fast,"" Wemple wrote.

Wemple wrote that Lack ""dodged"" his questions about the growing calls for an outside investigation.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network when asked about how he would carry on the #MeToo movement as president at the MSNBC debate, but he ultimately went a different direction.

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said ""the culture of how women are treated"" needed to change before saying, ""We have to... keep punching"" at domestic violence.

""No, I really mean it,"" Biden said, apparently unaware of what evoked the laughter.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC's high-level executives didn't think the network would take action anytime soon.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination – stubbornly continues to masquerade as a capitalist.

In fact, Warren’s extensive record of supporting radical policies shows beyond all doubt that she is a far-left, off-her-rocker, dyed-in-the-wool socialist.

Warren can call herself anything she wants, of course, but that doesn’t make her claim true. She is no more a capitalist than she is a Native American – another false claim she made about herself for years.

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: ELIZABETH WARREN ADMITS TO A COLOSSAL CAMPAIGN ERROR. THIS IS WHAT SHE DID NEXT

Why is Warren hiding her socialism? Because she’s not stupid. She knows that being honest and admitting she is a socialist will scare off millions of voters – making it difficult to win the Democratic presidential nomination and likely impossible to defeat President Trump a year from now in the general election.

According to a new Heartland Institute-Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 likely voters, only 26 percent of Americans say they would “vote for a presidential candidate who identifies himself or herself as a socialist.” And only 12 percent said they think socialism is a “better … economic system” than a free-market system. The survey was conducted Nov. 13 and 14.

Even more devastating for socialist presidential candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the survey found that half of independents and nearly one in three Democrats (31 percent) said they would not vote for a socialist presidential candidate.

Perhaps most interesting, 19 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Warren and 20 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Sanders – who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist – said they would not vote for a socialist in 2020.

While I disagree with Sanders on just about all issues of public policy, I give him credit for admitting he’s a socialist. However, his honesty about this one issue will likely doom his presidential candidacy.

In Warren’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

When Sanders likely withdraws from the nominating race, most of his supporters will probably throw their backing to Warren, because the two candidates hold similar positions on most issues. That may be enough to make Warren the Democratic presidential nominee next year – a prospect that must delight Trump.

You can count on the president to label whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him as a wild-eyed socialist with crazy and dangerous ideas. In Warren’s case – just as in the case of Sanders – this description is absolutely accurate.

Warren supports nearly every high-profile, far-left policy embraced by Sanders and other socialist radicals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. These policies include a nationwide single-payer health care scheme (throwing more than 150 million Americans off their private health insurance plans), “free” college, cancellation of college debt, and the extraordinarily expensive Green New Deal that would wreck our economy send energy prices soaring.

Warren has also endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s “Just Society” plan. Among other completely insane parts of the Just Society is a provision that would prevent government agencies from barring convicted criminals and illegal immigrants from accessing federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits.

In Warren and AOC’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

All these pie-in-the-sky schemes would cost trillions of dollars to actually implement. Even if a President Warren were to confiscate everything the richest Americans owned and left them penniless and homeless, she would still have to raise taxes on the rest of us to fund her massively expensive government expansion.

Unfortunately for Comrades Bernie and Elizabeth, the Heartland-Rasmussen survey shows that despite the mountains of positive media coverage socialism and socialist candidates have received in the past year, Americans still aren’t buying the idea that centrally planned, collective economic systems work better than free markets. And there are good reasons for that, too.

Socialist and communist parties killed, exiled or imprisoned more than 167 million people in the 20th century. The recent chaos in countries like Venezuela – where there are shortages of all sorts of consumer goods and some people have resorted to eating zoo animals to survive – has served as a reminder that whenever socialism is attempted, it inevitably results in bloodshed and economic collapse.

Meanwhile, market-based capitalist reforms in India have liberated hundreds of millions of people from extreme poverty in just the past few decades alone.

And although America’s market economy is far from perfect – due in large part to arrangements made by corrupt governments and massive corporations – it has still created a higher quality of life than anything human beings have ever experienced.

The poorest among us today live better, longer, healthier lives than billions of people around the world – including hundreds of millions living in current or former socialist nations.

Most Americans know socialism doesn’t work.

But many don’t understand that what Elizabeth Warren and others are selling is – despite many the promises to the contrary – the same destructive, dangerous, disastrous ideas socialists have been peddling for more than 100 years.

If Americans figure that out, it would spell disaster for Warren, Sanders and their Democratic congressional comrades trying to keep control of the House and seize power in the Senate.

As a result, many of the Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination are scrambling to soften their support for this radical restructuring of our health care system or highlighting their opposition to it.

But here’s the truth you won’t hear from the Democratic would-be presidents: Those who say they oppose a government takeover of our health insurance system are simply trying to soothe nervous moderates.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

Once private insurance companies were eliminated there would be nothing to stop the federal government from raising premiums and taxes and cutting insurance benefits. And we, the American people, would have nowhere else to turn to get needed health insurance.

The one-minute ad, which was posted on social media and features images of Bloomberg campaigning alongside those during his younger years, shots of New York City and unflattering images of President Trump, is “the launch ad,” according to one of his top advisers.

Along with the video, Bloomberg posted a written statement on his campaign website in which he laid out why he was the best candidate to defeat President Trump next November.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

“We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he continued. “He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.”

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but rumors hit a frenzied point earlier this month when he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Bloomberg had announced earlier this year that he would not seek the party's nomination. But, in a statement obtained by Fox News in early November, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said Bloomberg was worried that the current crop of Democrats seeking the White House was ""not well-positioned"" to defeat President Trump.

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

Bloomberg's expected move has come amid increasing concern about the leftward drift of the major Democratic candidates, the departure of candidates who failed to gain traction – and talk of other potential late entries.

BLOOMBERG WON'T CAMPAIGN IN EARLY VOTING STATES IF HE RUNS

Bloomberg’s entrance comes just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, an unorthodox move that reflects anxiety within the Democratic Party about the strength of its current candidates.

As a centrist with deep ties to Wall Street, Bloomberg is expected to struggle among the party’s energized progressive base. He became a Democrat only last year. Yet his tremendous resources and moderate profile could be appealing in a primary contest that has become, above all, a quest to find the person best-positioned to deny Trump a second term next November.

Forbes ranked Bloomberg as the 11th-richest person in the world last year with a net worth of roughly $50 billion. Trump, by contrast, was ranked 259th with a net worth of just over $3 billion.

Already, Bloomberg has vowed to spend at least $150 million of his fortune on various pieces of a 2020 campaign, including more than $100 million for internet ads attacking Trump, between $15 million and $20 million on a voter registration drive largely targeting minority voters, and more than $30 million on an initial round of television ads.

Even before the announcement was final, Democratic rivals like Bernie Sanders pounced on Bloomberg’s plans to rely on his personal fortune.

“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections,” Sanders tweeted on Friday.

Elizabeth Warren, another leading progressive candidate, also slammed Bloomberg on Saturday for trying to buy the presidency.

""I understand that rich people are going to have more shoes than the rest of us, they're going to have more cars than the rest of us, they're going to have more houses,” she said after a campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. “But they don't get a bigger share of democracy, especially in a Democratic primary. We need to be doing the face-to-face work that lifts every voice.""

And often, she's got a new federal agency for that, too.

A Fox News analysis of the Democratic presidential candidate's myriad and much-touted plans reveals that Warren's ambitious agenda of policy prescriptions would not only prompt sweeping change in everything from health care to clean energy, but would come with the creation of at least 20 offices, bureaus, agencies, divisions or councils.

ELIZABETH WARREN RALLY WITH AYANNA PRESSLEY BROUGHT TO BRIEF HALT BY PRO SCHOOL-CHOICE PROTESTERS

Some of these are entirely new; some would replace existing agencies, only on a bigger scale; and some would represent a relaunch of old agencies disbanded years ago. Taken together, what is proposed is a significant expansion in the size of the federal bureaucracy.

If elected president, Warren vows she'll oversee the establishment of new offices that would be responsible for educating members of Congress on technology, investigating ethics violations, ensuring the U.S. is trading with green countries and much, much more.

For instance, a new Secure Democracy Administration would have the power to take over the administration of federal elections from state governments that run afoul of certain standards. A White House Budgetary Office of Tribal Affairs would ""track and advance"" Native American-related spending.

From Warren's perspective, it's just more evidence of the detail-rich policy pitch that has defined her candidacy. But Republicans see more evidence of an over-reliance on big government -- and a political liability.

""No surprise that Elizabeth Warren wants to expand unnecessary government bureaucracy on top of her radical socialist proposals,"" Sarah Matthews, the deputy press secretary for President Trump's re-election campaign, told Fox News. ""Despite what Elizabeth Warren may think, more big government isn’t the solution. President Trump believes our government should be smaller, smarter, and more efficient which is why he has delivered on his campaign promise to shrink the federal bureaucracy and get the government off the backs of the American people.""

Most of the new offices are explicitly outlined in Warren's campaign literature. But the total could be higher. At least one office -- the Office of United States Corporations -- is prescribed in a Warren bill linked to one of her campaign proposals, though the office is not mentioned on the campaign site.

The entity, under Warren's legislation, would issue charters to large American companies permitting them to operate. Hinting at this, Warren's ""Accountable Capitalism"" plan calls for issuing charters to American companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Warren's fondness for government agencies is hardly a secret. Her affiliation with one is part of her personal narrative. She mentions repeatedly on her site that she was one of then-President Obama's top advisers while his administration was creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Even though she wasn’t even in Congress at the time, she fought for the agency, built public support for it, and Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010,"" Warren's campaign website states. ""She then helped build the agency up from scratch. Now that agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has returned $12 billion directly to consumers scammed by financial institutions.""

ELIZABETH WARREN VOWS TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TEAR DOWN BORDER WALL

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Below is the full list of entities Warren says she would create:

CONSERVATIVE GROUP'S STUDY: 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WOULD WORSEN FINANCIALSITUATIOMN FOR MAJORITY OF US HOUSEHOLDS

But Warren's plans don't just create offices. She further advocates for a litany of commissions, programs and positions that also would expand the scope of other parts of the federal bureaucracy.

She proposes a commission on disability rights that would ensure federal disaster spending is ADA compliant, a ""diplomatic equivalent of the ROTC program"" and a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons, to name a few.

All these government entities would need to be funded, which would mean additional spending on top of other costly benefit programs ranging from ""Medicare-for-all"" to student debt cancellation.

KEY DEM INDICATES WARREN'S WEALTH TAX HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF PASSING THE HOUSE

Warren has called for ""big structural change,"" as a cornerstone of her campaign as she competes with Bernie Sanders -- a self-identified Democratic socialist -- for more progressive and liberal voters in the Democratic primary. Some Democrats, however, have worried that her expansive vision will turn away moderates and independents.

Fellow 2020 hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., hit Warren on one of her more controversial policies -- a 2 percent wealth tax on individuals worth more than $50 million -- during the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta last week.

""The tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry it's cumbersome, it's been tried by other nations, it's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation,"" Booker said in a heated exchange with Warren. ""But again, we as Democrats, have got to start talking not just about how you tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it.""

Warren's website says she would use the wealth tax to help fund many of her proposals. However, conservatives decry Warren's embrace of more government agencies and programs as a move in the wrong direction.

""It would take an army of bureaucrats and vastly more spending to realize Senator Warren’s command and control aspirations,"" said Romina Boccia, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Grover M.Hermann Center for the Federal Budget.

She also warned that the ""swamp"" President Trump vowed to drain still bubbles with bureaucracy: ""President Trump’s administration continues to have success in draining the swamp through deregulation. And yet, we’ve also seen vast, irresponsible spending increases that feed the swamp. Returning power to the people must include starving the bureaucratic beast, which means holding the line on spending."""

Warren can call herself anything she wants, of course, but that doesn’t make her claim true. She is no more a capitalist than she is a Native American – another false claim she made about herself for years.

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: ELIZABETH WARREN ADMITS TO A COLOSSAL CAMPAIGN ERROR. THIS IS WHAT SHE DID NEXT

Why is Warren hiding her socialism? Because she’s not stupid. She knows that being honest and admitting she is a socialist will scare off millions of voters – making it difficult to win the Democratic presidential nomination and likely impossible to defeat President Trump a year from now in the general election.

According to a new Heartland Institute-Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 likely voters, only 26 percent of Americans say they would “vote for a presidential candidate who identifies himself or herself as a socialist.” And only 12 percent said they think socialism is a “better … economic system” than a free-market system. The survey was conducted Nov. 13 and 14.

Even more devastating for socialist presidential candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the survey found that half of independents and nearly one in three Democrats (31 percent) said they would not vote for a socialist presidential candidate.

Perhaps most interesting, 19 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Warren and 20 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Sanders – who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist – said they would not vote for a socialist in 2020.

While I disagree with Sanders on just about all issues of public policy, I give him credit for admitting he’s a socialist. However, his honesty about this one issue will likely doom his presidential candidacy.

In Warren’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

When Sanders likely withdraws from the nominating race, most of his supporters will probably throw their backing to Warren, because the two candidates hold similar positions on most issues. That may be enough to make Warren the Democratic presidential nominee next year – a prospect that must delight Trump.

You can count on the president to label whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him as a wild-eyed socialist with crazy and dangerous ideas. In Warren’s case – just as in the case of Sanders – this description is absolutely accurate.

Warren supports nearly every high-profile, far-left policy embraced by Sanders and other socialist radicals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. These policies include a nationwide single-payer health care scheme (throwing more than 150 million Americans off their private health insurance plans), “free” college, cancellation of college debt, and the extraordinarily expensive Green New Deal that would wreck our economy send energy prices soaring.

Warren has also endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s “Just Society” plan. Among other completely insane parts of the Just Society is a provision that would prevent government agencies from barring convicted criminals and illegal immigrants from accessing federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits.

In Warren and AOC’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

All these pie-in-the-sky schemes would cost trillions of dollars to actually implement. Even if a President Warren were to confiscate everything the richest Americans owned and left them penniless and homeless, she would still have to raise taxes on the rest of us to fund her massively expensive government expansion.

Unfortunately for Comrades Bernie and Elizabeth, the Heartland-Rasmussen survey shows that despite the mountains of positive media coverage socialism and socialist candidates have received in the past year, Americans still aren’t buying the idea that centrally planned, collective economic systems work better than free markets. And there are good reasons for that, too.

Socialist and communist parties killed, exiled or imprisoned more than 167 million people in the 20th century. The recent chaos in countries like Venezuela – where there are shortages of all sorts of consumer goods and some people have resorted to eating zoo animals to survive – has served as a reminder that whenever socialism is attempted, it inevitably results in bloodshed and economic collapse.

Meanwhile, market-based capitalist reforms in India have liberated hundreds of millions of people from extreme poverty in just the past few decades alone.

And although America’s market economy is far from perfect – due in large part to arrangements made by corrupt governments and massive corporations – it has still created a higher quality of life than anything human beings have ever experienced.

The poorest among us today live better, longer, healthier lives than billions of people around the world – including hundreds of millions living in current or former socialist nations.

Most Americans know socialism doesn’t work.

But many don’t understand that what Elizabeth Warren and others are selling is – despite many the promises to the contrary – the same destructive, dangerous, disastrous ideas socialists have been peddling for more than 100 years.

If Americans figure that out, it would spell disaster for Warren, Sanders and their Democratic congressional comrades trying to keep control of the House and seize power in the Senate.

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

“The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62



TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: Did you ever hear the one about the blind men trying to describe an elephant? One said it was a snake, one said it was a rope, one said it was the trunk of a tree. It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“This episode and others have brought me to the highly self-serving conclusion that nothing parents do alters a child’s character anyway, so there is no need to fret that some misdirected pedagogy or slip of the tongue will forever ruin him.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

BLOOMBERG UNION FIRES BACK ON BAN TO AVOID INVESTIGATING 2020 DEMS: 'SILENCING JOURNALISTS'

A video released on Sunday by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg marked the official start of the politician/media mogul's 2020 presidential run, Fox News reported.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but then he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Varney said he finds it ironic that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have ""built their campaigns around getting rid of billionaires,"" are now running against ""Bloomberg's mountain of money.""

""Money really talks in politics,"" Varney added.

Warren and Sanders shouldn't be the only ones opposed to a Bloomberg run, however, the Fox Nation host observed -- warning Joe Biden of his new competition.

""Joe Biden can't be happy. Joe occupies the center. But his campaign is lackluster and he's not raising much money. Overnight, Bloomberg has taken over the middle ground.,"" Varney explained.

Varney credited Bloomberg for his deliberately late strategy, but his run ""throws the party into even more chaos,"" he said.

BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN MANAGER ON 2020: TRUMP IS WINNING

""His strategy is unusual, but very smart. He'll enter the race deliberately late. He'll let his competitors tear each other apart and spend their money and then jump into Super Tuesday in March. California and 14 other states hold primary votes that day. Bloomberg's billions will have an enormous impact,"" Varney said.

""And consider this,"" he added, ""there may be an impeachment trial in the Senate right around that time, March of next year. Senators Warren Sanders, Klobuchar, Booker, Harris. They're not going to be on the campaign trail -- they'll have to be in D.C. passing judgment on the president.""

Bloomberg's run further divides the Democratic Party, Varney explained, and he believes it ""opens the door to a Trump win in 2020.""

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

""It's hard to believe that Democrats welcome this,"" Varney said.""I can't see the supporters of Warren and Sanders suddenly jumping ship for the $50 billion man. I can't see rural moderates getting behind a candidate who has no time for guns. And I can't see Southerners or Midwesterners supporting a climate warrior.""

""Bloomberg not only splits the party, he throws it into even more chaos. And that means no matter who leads the Democrats next year, the party remains at war with itself.""

As a result, many of the Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination are scrambling to soften their support for this radical restructuring of our health care system or highlighting their opposition to it.

But here’s the truth you won’t hear from the Democratic would-be presidents: Those who say they oppose a government takeover of our health insurance system are simply trying to soothe nervous moderates.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

But during a Monday speech in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, the former two-term Massachusetts governor delivered a pointed warning to fellow members of his party.

“I don’t think you have to hate Republicans to be a good Democrat. I don’t think you have to hate conservatives to be a good progressive or to hate business to be a good social justice warrior,” he said.

PATRICK MAKES A VERY LATE ENTRY INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The comment by Patrick at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics's ""Politics and Eggs"" – a must-stop for White House hopefuls – appeared to be an indirect shot at the progressive standard-bearers in the 2020 Democratic nomination race, populist Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Patrick, who announced his candidacy just a week-and-a-half ago, also highlighted that “we need leadership that understands that unity makes us not only stronger but successful.”

Patrick served as U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under then-President Bill Clinton. He was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2006 and reelected in 2010, the first black governor in the commonwealth's history.

After leaving office in 2015, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.

While considered a moderate, the 63-year-old Patrick insisted that he’s “not talking about a moderate agenda. That’s the last thing we need.""

Instead, he said he’s “talking about being woke while leaving room for the still-waking. What it takes to govern and what it takes to actually make change that lasts.”

And he said the reason he’s running is his “experience, both in range and depth. I have two terms of accomplishments and reforms as governor, a record of successful leadership in business.”

Launching a campaign with just over two months to go until the start of the nominating calendar, Patrick faces extremely high hurdles, which he acknowledges. But an optimistic Patrick, on his late entry into the race, told reporters “the path we knew was there is wider than I fully appreciated.""

“It’s a wide-open race,” he spotlighted.

And pointing to his rivals for the nomination, he stressed that “the fact that folks have been in for a long time and campaigning for a long time and raising money for a long time has not closed, has not resolved it. It’s a little bit of what I think about the importance of money or lack of money. We want it. We’re raising it so that we’re competitive and we’re confident that we will.”

Patrick’s stop in New Hampshire – his second since announcing his candidacy – came one day after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The multimillionaire business and medial mogul on Monday launched a massive $32 million ad buy, airing biographical TV commercials in media markets from coast to coast.

Asked by Fox News how he can compete against that kind of money, Patrick responded: “I’ve been up against odds like that in the past. We’re going to do the work. I happen to believe that the work is much more about connecting with people personally and where they are in every sense of the term and that’s what we’re going to do.”

Bloomberg is skipping the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which hold the first four nominating contests in February. Instead, he’s concentrating his firepower on the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and in the states later in the nominating calendar.

Patrick emphasized his commitment to campaigning in the early voting states, saying, “as a practical matter, we’re going to try to spend a lot of time here in New Hampshire and in South Carolina, but we will be active in Iowa and Nevada as well.”

And he touted that “we’re going to make our presence felt and build this organization.”

Patrick is the second Massachusetts resident in the race, following Warren.

Asked by Fox News about his phone conversation with Warren earlier this month, before he launched his bid, Patrick said “it was uncomfortable. We’re friends and I think in an ideal world, we would be working as collaborators rather than competitors. But I think you can compete with your friends and keep it friendly.”"

The 77-year-old billionaire added that he “looked in the mirror and said, ‘I just cannot let this happen.’""

Calling himself a problem-solver who can rebuild America and beat the “existential threat"" posed by the president, Bloomberg was chatting with people at a diner in Norfolk, Va. The state is part of his strategy of focusing on states with primaries on Super Tuesday.

Bloomberg's remarks echoed those of his campaign manager, Kevin Sheeky, earlier in the day. ""Right now, Donald Trump is winning,"" Sheekey said. ""It’s very tough for people who don’t live in New York or California to understand that, but that is what’s happening.""

Polls have shown that independents are souring on the idea of impeaching and removing Trump from office, including in critical battleground states like Wisconsin, even after House Democrats aggressively presented their case over the past two weeks.

The centrist Bloomberg is joining an already-crowded group of Democrats, who wasted no time in unloading on the former Big Apple mayor. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example, said voters don't want ""another wealthy person"" in the White House. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Bloomberg's $30 million advertising buy, saying he was “disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections.""

Sanders, for his part, has already committed to spending $30 million on his own advertising, although the money was raised from supporters.

As for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on Monday she spoke at a community meeting in Ankeny, Iowa: ""Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020. He doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money. I think Michael Bloomberg is wrong and that's what we need to prove in this election.""

Bloomberg said his campaign would focus on issues including gun control, the environment and education. But already, his campaign has been shrouded in ethics concerns and dogged by his past policies. For example, the news service that bears Bloomberg's name said Sunday it will not “investigate” him or any of his Democratic rivals, and Bloomberg Opinion will no longer run unsigned editorials.

Bloomberg News' announcement led the organization’s former Washington bureau chief to blast the decision as “staggering” and “not journalism.”

And last month, during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg suddenly apologized for his unprecedented “stop and frisk” policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration.

That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his speech, Bloomberg recognized that the policy, which has been credited for cutting down on violent crime, led to “far too many innocent people” being stopped, many of them black or Latino.

“Over time I’ve come to understand something that I’ve long struggled to admit to myself,” Bloomberg told congregants at the Christian Cultural Center in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. “I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. ... The erosion of that trust bothered me. And I want to earn it back.""

But, the city's top police union hit back within hours, while commentators noted that Bloomberg had defended ""stop and frisk"" even after a judge ruled it was unconstitutional as enforced in 2013. (""This is a dangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the U.S. Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court,” Bloomberg told the media at the time. “I worry for my kids, and I worry for your kids. I worry for you and I worry for me. Crime can come back any time the criminals think they can get away with things. We just cannot let that happen.”)

“Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street,"" Police Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch said.

""We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities,"" Lynch continued. ""His administration’s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe. The apology is too little, too late.""

The one-minute ad, which was posted on social media and features images of Bloomberg campaigning alongside those during his younger years, shots of New York City and unflattering images of President Trump, is “the launch ad,” according to one of his top advisers.

Along with the video, Bloomberg posted a written statement on his campaign website in which he laid out why he was the best candidate to defeat President Trump next November.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

“We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he continued. “He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.”

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but rumors hit a frenzied point earlier this month when he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Bloomberg had announced earlier this year that he would not seek the party's nomination. But, in a statement obtained by Fox News in early November, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said Bloomberg was worried that the current crop of Democrats seeking the White House was ""not well-positioned"" to defeat President Trump.

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

Bloomberg's expected move has come amid increasing concern about the leftward drift of the major Democratic candidates, the departure of candidates who failed to gain traction – and talk of other potential late entries.

BLOOMBERG WON'T CAMPAIGN IN EARLY VOTING STATES IF HE RUNS

Bloomberg’s entrance comes just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, an unorthodox move that reflects anxiety within the Democratic Party about the strength of its current candidates.

As a centrist with deep ties to Wall Street, Bloomberg is expected to struggle among the party’s energized progressive base. He became a Democrat only last year. Yet his tremendous resources and moderate profile could be appealing in a primary contest that has become, above all, a quest to find the person best-positioned to deny Trump a second term next November.

Forbes ranked Bloomberg as the 11th-richest person in the world last year with a net worth of roughly $50 billion. Trump, by contrast, was ranked 259th with a net worth of just over $3 billion.

Already, Bloomberg has vowed to spend at least $150 million of his fortune on various pieces of a 2020 campaign, including more than $100 million for internet ads attacking Trump, between $15 million and $20 million on a voter registration drive largely targeting minority voters, and more than $30 million on an initial round of television ads.

Even before the announcement was final, Democratic rivals like Bernie Sanders pounced on Bloomberg’s plans to rely on his personal fortune.

“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections,” Sanders tweeted on Friday.

Elizabeth Warren, another leading progressive candidate, also slammed Bloomberg on Saturday for trying to buy the presidency.

""I understand that rich people are going to have more shoes than the rest of us, they're going to have more cars than the rest of us, they're going to have more houses,” she said after a campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. “But they don't get a bigger share of democracy, especially in a Democratic primary. We need to be doing the face-to-face work that lifts every voice.""

Calling the evidence against the president ""overwhelming, unchallenged and damning,"" Schiff nevertheless asserted that investigative work would continue, and left open the possibility that Democrats would hold additional hearings. But all scheduled public hearings before Schiff's panel wrapped up on a testy note last week, and no new proceedings are planned.

""As required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to congressional colleagues.

He noted that the report ""will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct. Such obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon.""

In a worrying omen for moderate Democrats in swing districts that could have factored into Schiff's decision, polls have shown that independents are souring on the impeachment process. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

Once it receives Schiff's report, the House Judiciary Committee has the option of drafting articles of impeachment outright or holding further hearings. Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in any potential Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such proceedings.

But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

Fox News reported last week that Democrats were considering four articles of impeachment against the president: Abuse of power, bribery, contempt of Congress, and obstruction of justice.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House last Thursday, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""Frankly, I want a trial."" — President Trump

Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration. ""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

Should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats -- including Trump's allegations of corruption against Joe and Hunter Biden involving their Ukraine dealings.

Additionally, Republicans would likely focus on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and defend the president's push for investigations in that area before releasing any foreign aid. Numerous media outlets, and a Ukrainian court, have confirmed that Ukrainian actors meddled in the election, despite claims by Democrats and many media personalities that the allegations amount to a ""conspiracy theory.""

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

But, Graham indicated that any Senate trial wouldn't be pleasant for at least one Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Thursday, Graham penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

The letter pertained to Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid when he was vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy. The prosecutor was probing Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board despite having little relevant experience.

Already, some witnesses in the impeachment probe have raised concerns about the Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, for example, testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about the younger Biden's role on the board of Burisma. And former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said she was ""aware"" of a potential issue, because Obama administration officials prepped her for questions about Hunter Biden during her confirmation process.

""I was aware of it because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a -- in terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer, so I was aware of it,"" Yovanovitch said.

She added that she was told that if the matter came up, she should refer questions to other departments.

And often, she's got a new federal agency for that, too.

A Fox News analysis of the Democratic presidential candidate's myriad and much-touted plans reveals that Warren's ambitious agenda of policy prescriptions would not only prompt sweeping change in everything from health care to clean energy, but would come with the creation of at least 20 offices, bureaus, agencies, divisions or councils.

ELIZABETH WARREN RALLY WITH AYANNA PRESSLEY BROUGHT TO BRIEF HALT BY PRO SCHOOL-CHOICE PROTESTERS

Some of these are entirely new; some would replace existing agencies, only on a bigger scale; and some would represent a relaunch of old agencies disbanded years ago. Taken together, what is proposed is a significant expansion in the size of the federal bureaucracy.

If elected president, Warren vows she'll oversee the establishment of new offices that would be responsible for educating members of Congress on technology, investigating ethics violations, ensuring the U.S. is trading with green countries and much, much more.

For instance, a new Secure Democracy Administration would have the power to take over the administration of federal elections from state governments that run afoul of certain standards. A White House Budgetary Office of Tribal Affairs would ""track and advance"" Native American-related spending.

From Warren's perspective, it's just more evidence of the detail-rich policy pitch that has defined her candidacy. But Republicans see more evidence of an over-reliance on big government -- and a political liability.

""No surprise that Elizabeth Warren wants to expand unnecessary government bureaucracy on top of her radical socialist proposals,"" Sarah Matthews, the deputy press secretary for President Trump's re-election campaign, told Fox News. ""Despite what Elizabeth Warren may think, more big government isn’t the solution. President Trump believes our government should be smaller, smarter, and more efficient which is why he has delivered on his campaign promise to shrink the federal bureaucracy and get the government off the backs of the American people.""

Most of the new offices are explicitly outlined in Warren's campaign literature. But the total could be higher. At least one office -- the Office of United States Corporations -- is prescribed in a Warren bill linked to one of her campaign proposals, though the office is not mentioned on the campaign site.

The entity, under Warren's legislation, would issue charters to large American companies permitting them to operate. Hinting at this, Warren's ""Accountable Capitalism"" plan calls for issuing charters to American companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Warren's fondness for government agencies is hardly a secret. Her affiliation with one is part of her personal narrative. She mentions repeatedly on her site that she was one of then-President Obama's top advisers while his administration was creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Even though she wasn’t even in Congress at the time, she fought for the agency, built public support for it, and Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010,"" Warren's campaign website states. ""She then helped build the agency up from scratch. Now that agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has returned $12 billion directly to consumers scammed by financial institutions.""

ELIZABETH WARREN VOWS TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TEAR DOWN BORDER WALL

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Below is the full list of entities Warren says she would create:

CONSERVATIVE GROUP'S STUDY: 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WOULD WORSEN FINANCIALSITUATIOMN FOR MAJORITY OF US HOUSEHOLDS

But Warren's plans don't just create offices. She further advocates for a litany of commissions, programs and positions that also would expand the scope of other parts of the federal bureaucracy.

She proposes a commission on disability rights that would ensure federal disaster spending is ADA compliant, a ""diplomatic equivalent of the ROTC program"" and a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons, to name a few.

All these government entities would need to be funded, which would mean additional spending on top of other costly benefit programs ranging from ""Medicare-for-all"" to student debt cancellation.

KEY DEM INDICATES WARREN'S WEALTH TAX HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF PASSING THE HOUSE

Warren has called for ""big structural change,"" as a cornerstone of her campaign as she competes with Bernie Sanders -- a self-identified Democratic socialist -- for more progressive and liberal voters in the Democratic primary. Some Democrats, however, have worried that her expansive vision will turn away moderates and independents.

Fellow 2020 hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., hit Warren on one of her more controversial policies -- a 2 percent wealth tax on individuals worth more than $50 million -- during the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta last week.

""The tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry it's cumbersome, it's been tried by other nations, it's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation,"" Booker said in a heated exchange with Warren.

Warren's website says she would use the wealth tax to help fund many of her proposals. However, conservatives decry Warren's embrace of more government agencies and programs as a move in the wrong direction.

""It would take an army of bureaucrats and vastly more spending to realize Senator Warren’s command and control aspirations,"" said Romina Boccia, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Grover M.Hermann Center for the Federal Budget.

She also warned that the ""swamp"" President Trump vowed to drain still bubbles with bureaucracy: ""President Trump’s administration continues to have success in draining the swamp through deregulation. And yet, we’ve also seen vast, irresponsible spending increases that feed the swamp. Returning power to the people must include starving the bureaucratic beast, which means holding the line on spending."""

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

“The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62



TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: Did you ever hear the one about the blind men trying to describe an elephant? One said it was a snake, one said it was a rope, one said it was the trunk of a tree. It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“This episode and others have brought me to the highly self-serving conclusion that nothing parents do alters a child’s character anyway, so there is no need to fret that some misdirected pedagogy or slip of the tongue will forever ruin him.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

On the roster: Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden knotted in N.H. - Detroit Democrat does impeachment flip-flop-flip - Audible: How it’s done - The car that caught the dog



BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”



Bloomy’s low-key, high-dollar launch - NYT: “Michael R. Bloomberg started his campaign at a hushed diner in downtown Norfolk, Va. … before strolling to a nearby hotel ballroom and making an efficient statement before a bank of television cameras. Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

AUDIBLE: HOW IT’S DONE

“Chris Wallace is a damn good reporter. He asked me a very direct question. He asked me about hacking the DNC computer. I heard him say I thought he'd said meddling in the election. Chris was right. I was wrong. So let me be clear. Russia hacked the DNC computer. I have no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine did it.” – Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

"" I don't know whether a 77-year-old anti-gun New Yorker can win the Democratic nomination or the presidential election, but he has taken a buzz saw to the party and split it down the middle.""

BLOOMBERG UNION FIRES BACK ON BAN TO AVOID INVESTIGATING 2020 DEMS: 'SILENCING JOURNALISTS'

A video released on Sunday by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg marked the official start of the politician/media mogul's 2020 presidential run, Fox News reported.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but then he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Varney said he finds it ironic that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have ""built their campaigns around getting rid of billionaires,"" are now running against ""Bloomberg's mountain of money.""

""Money really talks in politics,"" Varney added.

Warren and Sanders shouldn't be the only ones opposed to a Bloomberg run, however, the Fox Nation host observed -- warning Joe Biden of his new competition.

""Joe Biden can't be happy. Joe occupies the center. But his campaign is lackluster and he's not raising much money. Overnight, Bloomberg has taken over the middle ground.,"" Varney explained.

Varney credited Bloomberg for his deliberately late strategy, but his run ""throws the party into even more chaos,"" he said.

BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN MANAGER ON 2020: TRUMP IS WINNING

""His strategy is unusual, but very smart. He'll enter the race deliberately late. He'll let his competitors tear each other apart and spend their money and then jump into Super Tuesday in March. California and 14 other states hold primary votes that day. Bloomberg's billions will have an enormous impact,"" Varney said.

""And consider this,"" he added, ""there may be an impeachment trial in the Senate right around that time, March of next year. Senators Warren Sanders, Klobuchar, Booker, Harris. They're not going to be on the campaign trail -- they'll have to be in D.C. passing judgment on the president.""

Bloomberg's run further divides the Democratic Party, Varney explained, and he believes it ""opens the door to a Trump win in 2020.""

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

""It's hard to believe that Democrats welcome this,"" Varney said.""I can't see the supporters of Warren and Sanders suddenly jumping ship for the $50 billion man. I can't see rural moderates getting behind a candidate who has no time for guns. And I can't see Southerners or Midwesterners supporting a climate warrior.""

""Bloomberg not only splits the party, he throws it into even more chaos. And that means no matter who leads the Democrats next year, the party remains at war with itself.""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new report that sheds light on Obama's personal views of the jam-packed primary field with no clear front-runner.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders.

But a new Politico Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

""Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,"" the report says. An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is.

One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action.

""I can't really confirm that,"" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. ""He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.""

This aversion to Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political ""wokeness"" and cancel culture.

""This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not want to “tear down the system.”

Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump.

The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement.

But during a Monday speech in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, the former two-term Massachusetts governor delivered a pointed warning to fellow members of his party.

“I don’t think you have to hate Republicans to be a good Democrat. I don’t think you have to hate conservatives to be a good progressive or to hate business to be a good social justice warrior,” he said.

PATRICK MAKES A VERY LATE ENTRY INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The comment by Patrick at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics's ""Politics and Eggs"" – a must-stop for White House hopefuls – appeared to be an indirect shot at the progressive standard-bearers in the 2020 Democratic nomination race, populist Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Patrick, who announced his candidacy just a week-and-a-half ago, also highlighted that “we need leadership that understands that unity makes us not only stronger but successful.”

Patrick served as U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under then-President Bill Clinton. He was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2006 and reelected in 2010, the first black governor in the commonwealth's history.

After leaving office in 2015, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.

While considered a moderate, the 63-year-old Patrick insisted that he’s “not talking about a moderate agenda. That’s the last thing we need.""

Instead, he said he’s “talking about being woke while leaving room for the still-waking. What it takes to govern and what it takes to actually make change that lasts.”

And he said the reason he’s running is his “experience, both in range and depth. I have two terms of accomplishments and reforms as governor, a record of successful leadership in business.”

Launching a campaign with just over two months to go until the start of the nominating calendar, Patrick faces extremely high hurdles, which he acknowledges. But an optimistic Patrick, on his late entry into the race, told reporters “the path we knew was there is wider than I fully appreciated.""

“It’s a wide-open race,” he spotlighted.

And pointing to his rivals for the nomination, he stressed that “the fact that folks have been in for a long time and campaigning for a long time and raising money for a long time has not closed, has not resolved it. It’s a little bit of what I think about the importance of money or lack of money. We want it. We’re raising it so that we’re competitive and we’re confident that we will.”

Patrick’s stop in New Hampshire – his second since announcing his candidacy – came one day after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The multimillionaire business and medial mogul on Monday launched a massive $32 million ad buy, airing biographical TV commercials in media markets from coast to coast.

Asked by Fox News how he can compete against that kind of money, Patrick responded: “I’ve been up against odds like that in the past. We’re going to do the work. I happen to believe that the work is much more about connecting with people personally and where they are in every sense of the term and that’s what we’re going to do.”

Bloomberg is skipping the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which hold the first four nominating contests in February. Instead, he’s concentrating his firepower on the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and in the states later in the nominating calendar.

Patrick emphasized his commitment to campaigning in the early voting states, saying, “as a practical matter, we’re going to try to spend a lot of time here in New Hampshire and in South Carolina, but we will be active in Iowa and Nevada as well.”

And he touted that “we’re going to make our presence felt and build this organization.”

Patrick is the second Massachusetts resident in the race, following Warren.

Asked by Fox News about his phone conversation with Warren earlier this month, before he launched his bid, Patrick said “it was uncomfortable. We’re friends and I think in an ideal world, we would be working as collaborators rather than competitors. But I think you can compete with your friends and keep it friendly.”"

The 77-year-old billionaire added that he “looked in the mirror and said, ‘I just cannot let this happen.’""

Calling himself a problem-solver who can rebuild America and beat the “existential threat"" posed by the president, Bloomberg was chatting with people at a diner in Norfolk, Va. The state is part of his strategy of focusing on states with primaries on Super Tuesday.

Bloomberg's remarks echoed those of his campaign manager, Kevin Sheeky, earlier in the day. ""Right now, Donald Trump is winning,"" Sheekey said. ""It’s very tough for people who don’t live in New York or California to understand that, but that is what’s happening.""

Polls have shown that independents are souring on the idea of impeaching and removing Trump from office, including in critical battleground states like Wisconsin, even after House Democrats aggressively presented their case over the past two weeks.

The centrist Bloomberg is joining an already-crowded group of Democrats, who wasted no time in unloading on the former Big Apple mayor. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example, said voters don't want ""another wealthy person"" in the White House. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Bloomberg's $30 million advertising buy, saying he was “disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections.""

Sanders, for his part, has already committed to spending $30 million on his own advertising, although the money was raised from supporters.

As for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on Monday she spoke at a community meeting in Ankeny, Iowa: ""Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020. He doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money. I think Michael Bloomberg is wrong and that's what we need to prove in this election.""

Bloomberg said his campaign would focus on issues including gun control, the environment and education. But already, his campaign has been shrouded in ethics concerns and dogged by his past policies. For example, the news service that bears Bloomberg's name said Sunday it will not “investigate” him or any of his Democratic rivals, and Bloomberg Opinion will no longer run unsigned editorials.

Bloomberg News' announcement led the organization’s former Washington bureau chief to blast the decision as “staggering” and “not journalism.”

And last month, during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg suddenly apologized for his unprecedented “stop and frisk” policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration.

That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his speech, Bloomberg recognized that the policy, which has been credited for cutting down on violent crime, led to “far too many innocent people” being stopped, many of them black or Latino.

“Over time I’ve come to understand something that I’ve long struggled to admit to myself,” Bloomberg told congregants at the Christian Cultural Center in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. “I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. ... The erosion of that trust bothered me. And I want to earn it back.""

But, the city's top police union hit back within hours, while commentators noted that Bloomberg had defended ""stop and frisk"" even after a judge ruled it was unconstitutional as enforced in 2013. (""This is a dangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the U.S. Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court,” Bloomberg told the media at the time. “I worry for my kids, and I worry for your kids. I worry for you and I worry for me. Crime can come back any time the criminals think they can get away with things. We just cannot let that happen.”)

“Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street,"" Police Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch said.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

""We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities,"" Lynch continued. ""His administration’s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe. The apology is too little, too late.""

Calling the evidence against the president ""overwhelming, unchallenged and damning,"" Schiff nevertheless asserted that investigative work would continue, and left open the possibility that Democrats would hold additional hearings. But all scheduled public hearings before Schiff's panel wrapped up on a testy note last week, and no new proceedings are planned.

""As required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to congressional colleagues.

He noted that the report ""will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct. Such obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon.""

In a worrying omen for moderate Democrats in swing districts that could have factored into Schiff's decision, polls have shown that independents are souring on the impeachment process. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

Once it receives Schiff's report, the House Judiciary Committee has the option of drafting articles of impeachment outright or holding further hearings. Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in any potential Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such proceedings.

But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

Fox News reported last week that Democrats were considering four articles of impeachment against the president: Abuse of power, bribery, contempt of Congress, and obstruction of justice.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House last Thursday, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""Frankly, I want a trial."" — President Trump

Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration. ""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

Should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats -- including Trump's allegations of corruption against Joe and Hunter Biden involving their Ukraine dealings.

Additionally, Republicans would likely focus on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and defend the president's push for investigations in that area before releasing any foreign aid. Numerous media outlets, and a Ukrainian court, have confirmed that Ukrainian actors meddled in the election, despite claims by Democrats and many media personalities that the allegations amount to a ""conspiracy theory.""

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

But, Graham indicated that any Senate trial wouldn't be pleasant for at least one Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Thursday, Graham penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

The letter pertained to Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid when he was vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy. The prosecutor was probing Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board despite having little relevant experience.

Already, some witnesses in the impeachment probe have raised concerns about the Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, for example, testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about the younger Biden's role on the board of Burisma. And former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said she was ""aware"" of a potential issue, because Obama administration officials prepped her for questions about Hunter Biden during her confirmation process.

""I was aware of it because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a -- in terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer, so I was aware of it,"" Yovanovitch said.

She added that she was told that if the matter came up, she should refer questions to other departments.

BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”

Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

I was wrong. So let me be clear. Russia hacked the DNC computer. I have no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine did it.” – Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

""And there's no one right now who can pull them all together,"" Perino added, saying Obama is the only person that can try. ""The only person who thinks that they could do that is a person who won nationally twice, Barack Obama.""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new report that sheds light on Obama's personal views of the jam-packed primary field with no clear front-runner.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders.

But a new Politico Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

""Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,"" the report says. An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is.

One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action.

""I can't really confirm that,"" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. ""He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.""

This aversion to Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political ""wokeness"" and cancel culture.

""This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not want to “tear down the system.”

Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump.

The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement.

168,Ronn Blitzer,"Joe Biden, from the very outset of his 2020 bid, has sought to leverage his history with old running mate President Barack Obama to propel him to the Democratic presidential nomination -- the problem is, this does not appear to be a plan shared by the former … [+3488 chars]","Joe Biden, from the very outset of his 2020 bid, has sought to leverage his history with old running mate Barack Obama to propel him to the Democratic presidential nomination -- the problem is, this does not appear to be a plan shared by the former president …",2019-11-27,Fox News,Obama’s Biden dig latest sign ex-president’s inner circle has doubts about his veep,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obamas-biden-dig-veep,"Joe Biden, from the very outset of his 2020 bid, has sought to leverage his history with old running mate President Barack Obama to propel him to the Democratic presidential nomination -- the problem is, this does not appear to be a plan shared by the former president or his closest advisers.

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."
169,Ben Shapiro,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Buttigieg's early candidacy gained credibility thanks to the moderation he displayed compared with other Democrats. He quickly lost steam when he tacked to the left.

Now Buttigieg has swiveled back toward the center, launching a series of assaults on the radical plans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and stealing her momentum in the largely white early primary states.

LIZ PEEK: BLOOMBERG RUN COULD HURT WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG — BUT MAYOR WOULD FACE UPHILL BATTLE

Normally, such political rises are attended by a spate of negative reactionary coverage, and Buttigieg's story is no different. The most effective attack on Buttigieg has centered around his complete lack of black support -- a crucial problem for a candidate whose party sees black voters as a near supermajority of primary voters in states like South Carolina.

Some of those attacks have focused on Buttigieg's less-than-stellar governance in South Bend, where crime rates have remained critically high and relations between the local population and police have been strained throughout his tenure.

But the latest attack is on Buttigieg's entire political mentality. This week, an article from Michael Harriot at The Root, titled ""Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF,"" trended on Twitter. What, exactly, was Buttigieg's lie? He suggested back in 2011 that not all educational outcome disparities between blacks and whites are attributable to systemic racism.

""The kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,"" Buttigieg stated (""whitely,"" in Harriot's adjective). ""You're motivated because you believe that at the end of your educational process, there is a reward; there's a stable life; there's a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially the lower-income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.""

According to Harriot, this statement makes Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----."" Why? Because majority-minority schools are underfunded compared with majority-white schools; because black students are ""disciplined more harshly than white students,"" as Harriot says; because black college graduates don't have as successful an employment record as white college graduates.

""Get-along moderates would rather make s--- up out of whole cloth than wade into the waters of reality,"" Harriot wrote. ""Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.""

But none of these three factors should explain the bulk of racial educational disparities. The black dropout rate from high school is far higher than that of white students, which has nothing to do with underfunded schools.

Black students, by best available data, misbehave in school more often than white students. Black students drop out of college far more often than white students, which has nothing to do with institutional discrimination. Adjusting for household income, black women actually overperform white women in terms of college attendance and income. Something else is going on.

What is going on? According to a 2018 study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, young black men do best in areas with high levels of fatherhood. Lack of school mobility, largely due to entrenched interests preventing such mobility, doesn't help either.

Harvard's Roland Fryer formalized ""a particular peer effect, 'acting white,' which potentially contributes to the ongoing puzzle of black underachievement.""

Former President Obama similarly suggested an ""element of truth"" in the accusation that education is undervalued in many black homes, lamenting the attitude ""OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly?"" A study from the Brookings Institution found that black students spend less time on homework than other racial groups -- by a long shot.

So, is Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----"" for pointing out that not all disparities can be attributed to institutional discrimination? Of course not. But in the Democratic Party, such common sense represents political suicide.

TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me? We have a pig here that has been chasing us since this morning ... folks, sorry, I can't stand (still) because it's biting me.’ The segment begins with studio journalist Giorgos Papadakis introducing the reporter.”

The survey, conducted for Fortune by anonymous workplace social network Blind, shows that 81.6 percent of the tech giant's employees support Cook in his efforts to speak directly with Trump on issues that affect the company and help ""shape policy in Apple's favor.""

Separately, 8 out of 10 respondents said that it is ""fair that some of Apple's products have been exempted from U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods."" Cook has repeatedly lobbied the Trump administration to exempt Apple's products, including the iPhone, Apple Watch and Macs, from tariffs.

TRUMP ASKS APPLE CEO IF THE TECH GIANT COULD 'GET INVOLVED IN BUILDING 5G IN THE US'

Following his Nov. 20 tour of Apple's manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, which has been open since 2013, Trump said he was looking at exempting the company from tariffs that have been placed on imports from China as part of the ongoing trade war between the two countries, according to Reuters. The president also asked Cook if the tech giant ""could get ... involved in building 5G in the U.S.""

In August, Fox Business reported that Cook told Trump that Apple's chief smartphone competitor, Samsung, is exempt from U.S. tariffs since its products are made outside of China.

Though there may be overwhelming praise for Cook in his efforts to persuade Trump, not everything he does has been viewed favorably. Only 30.9 percent of those responding to the Blind survey said they ""strongly agreed"" with their CEO participating in the Austin event, held during Trump's impeachment hearings. Twenty-three and a half percent said they ""agreed"" with Cook being there, 10.3 percent ""disagreed,"" 17.7 percent ""strongly disagreed"" and 18 percent were indifferent.

Blind's findings are from more than 100 Apple employees surveyed between Nov. 21 and No. 25, Fortune reported. The anonymous workplace social network confirmed respondents based on their Apple email addresses, noting that more than 50 percent of the company's employees on the social network identify themselves as engineers.

APPLE DELVES FURTHER INTO HEALTH AMBITIONS WITH NEW RESEARCH APP, HEALTH STUDIES

The two men have had a relationship seemingly since the start of Trump's presidency, one that has seemingly only grown over time.

In March, Trump said that Cook had “become a friend of mine"" during a meeting for the president's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. Separately during that meeting, Trump mistakenly called Cook ""Tim Apple"" in a slip of the tongue. Cook later decided to have a bit of fun at the president's expense, changing the name of his Twitter account to Tim Apple.

The 58-year-old Cook is one of the few CEOs in America with a direct line to Trump, according to an October report in The Wall Street Journal. “He’s [Cook] a great executive,” The Journal quoted Trump as saying, with the president adding “[o]thers go out and hire very expensive consultants. Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.”

TIM COOK, IN APPARENT JAB AT TRUMP, CHANGES HIS NAME TO TIM APPLE

Trump has also tweeted directly to Cook, including once in October when he asked the Alabama native to bring back the iPhone's home button.

Silicon Valley, regarded as a hotbed for liberalism, has often been at odds with many of the Trump administration's policies, including its stance on immigration, climate change and trade.

Fortune, citing political donations website OpenSecrets.org, notes that Apple's own employees have donated more money to Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals — including more than $88,000 to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-Vt. and more than $68,000 to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Ma. — than to Trump himself, at just $5,100.

Cook, on the other hand, has often spoken directly with Trump or one of his advisers, when issues such as climate change, trade policy or others affect the company.

During his January 2018 State of the Union address, Trump, who has repeatedly said “trade wars are good and easy to win,"" specifically mentioned that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would invest $350 billion in the U.S. and hire an additional 20,000 workers.

In April 2018, Larry Kudlow, Trump's director of the National Economic Council, specifically mentioned that Cook loved the tax cuts the Trump administration enacted in 2017.

“He said it’s great for business,"" Kudlow told CNBC at the time. ""And Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

""And there's no one right now who can pull them all together,"" Perino added, saying Obama is the only person that can try. ""The only person who thinks that they could do that is a person who won nationally twice, Barack Obama.""

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."

But I'll listen to Bill Gates, who says nuclear is a vital energy source, especially if you want to cut carbon emissions.

Trump? Yeah, he's bad: we have the lowest unemployment in decades for blacks, women, Hispanics are doing better under Trump than Obama. And bodies aren't coming home in coffins.

What's your alternative?

175,Ben Shapiro,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Telling the truth,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ben-shapiro-pete-buttigiegs-big-mistake-telling-the-truth,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Buttigieg's early candidacy gained credibility thanks to the moderation he displayed compared with other Democrats. He quickly lost steam when he tacked to the left.

Now Buttigieg has swiveled back toward the center, launching a series of assaults on the radical plans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and stealing her momentum in the largely white early primary states.

LIZ PEEK: BLOOMBERG RUN COULD HURT WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG — BUT MAYOR WOULD FACE UPHILL BATTLE

Normally, such political rises are attended by a spate of negative reactionary coverage, and Buttigieg's story is no different. The most effective attack on Buttigieg has centered around his complete lack of black support -- a crucial problem for a candidate whose party sees black voters as a near supermajority of primary voters in states like South Carolina.

Some of those attacks have focused on Buttigieg's less-than-stellar governance in South Bend, where crime rates have remained critically high and relations between the local population and police have been strained throughout his tenure.

But the latest attack is on Buttigieg's entire political mentality. This week, an article from Michael Harriot at The Root, titled ""Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF,"" trended on Twitter. What, exactly, was Buttigieg's lie? He suggested back in 2011 that not all educational outcome disparities between blacks and whites are attributable to systemic racism.

""The kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,"" Buttigieg stated (""whitely,"" in Harriot's adjective). ""You're motivated because you believe that at the end of your educational process, there is a reward; there's a stable life; there's a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially the lower-income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.""

According to Harriot, this statement makes Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----."" Why? Because majority-minority schools are underfunded compared with majority-white schools; because black students are ""disciplined more harshly than white students,"" as Harriot says; because black college graduates don't have as successful an employment record as white college graduates.

""Get-along moderates would rather make s--- up out of whole cloth than wade into the waters of reality,"" Harriot wrote. ""Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.""

But none of these three factors should explain the bulk of racial educational disparities. The black dropout rate from high school is far higher than that of white students, which has nothing to do with underfunded schools.

Black students, by best available data, misbehave in school more often than white students. Black students drop out of college far more often than white students, which has nothing to do with institutional discrimination. Adjusting for household income, black women actually overperform white women in terms of college attendance and income. Something else is going on.

What is going on? According to a 2018 study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, young black men do best in areas with high levels of fatherhood. Lack of school mobility, largely due to entrenched interests preventing such mobility, doesn't help either.

Harvard's Roland Fryer formalized ""a particular peer effect, 'acting white,' which potentially contributes to the ongoing puzzle of black underachievement.""

Former President Obama similarly suggested an ""element of truth"" in the accusation that education is undervalued in many black homes, lamenting the attitude ""OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly?"" A study from the Brookings Institution found that black students spend less time on homework than other racial groups -- by a long shot.

So, is Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----"" for pointing out that not all disparities can be attributed to institutional discrimination? Of course not. But in the Democratic Party, such common sense represents political suicide.

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!



TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me?

In addition to widespread poverty, insufficient health care and a host of other challenges, Native American communities in our country face persistent, egregious violence. In fact, Attorney General William Barr this week has done the country a badly needed service by pointing out that there is a virtual war against Native American women.

Before you think “war” is too strong a term, consider these facts.

ELIZABETH WARREN INTRODUCES BILL TO REVOKE MEDALS OF HONOR AWARDED FOR WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE

According to The Associated Press, the Urban Indian Health Institute reported 5,712 indigenous women were murdered or went missing in 2016 alone. Of that staggering number, only 116 were listed in a U.S. Department of Justice database tracking such statistics.

Further, the National Institute of Justice estimated that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lives – and more than half experienced sexual violence.

No American can be comfortable with a level of violence that affects more than 1 million women. It should be completely unacceptable that of the 5,712 cases of missing and murdered Native American girls, only 2 percent – one out of every 50 cases – makes it to the Justice Department database.

According to Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is himself a tribal member, 2016 National Institute of Justice reports reveal even more grim figures – estimating that more than four out of five Native American women have experienced violence, with more than half experiencing sexual violence.

As Cole put it: “Native women are more than one-and-a-half times more likely than White women to have experienced violence in the past year. Even more chilling, Native women face murder rates more than 10 times the national average in some parts of the country.”

Cole went on to point out that 96 percent of those who had been sexually assaulted were attacked by non-Native Americans.

Cole and others are taking steps to protect Native American girls and women.

As Cole wrote recently:

“I was proud to join with several of my House colleagues to introduce the Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safety (BADGES) for Native Communities Act. This bipartisan legislation addresses inefficiencies in federal criminal databases and increases tribal access to those databases.

“In response to the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, the BADGES Act also rightly seeks to improve public data on those cases while promoting more efficient recruitment and retention of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) law enforcement. Moreover, the legislation would provide tribes with resources to improve public safety coordination between their governments, states and federal agencies.”

Take a minute this holiday season while celebrating with family and friends and let your representative and your senators know that you want action taken to protect these vulnerable girls and women.

The survey, conducted for Fortune by anonymous workplace social network Blind, shows that 81.6 percent of the tech giant's employees support Cook in his efforts to speak directly with Trump on issues that affect the company and help ""shape policy in Apple's favor.""

Separately, 8 out of 10 respondents said that it is ""fair that some of Apple's products have been exempted from U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods."" Cook has repeatedly lobbied the Trump administration to exempt Apple's products, including the iPhone, Apple Watch and Macs, from tariffs.

TRUMP ASKS APPLE CEO IF THE TECH GIANT COULD 'GET INVOLVED IN BUILDING 5G IN THE US'

Following his Nov. 20 tour of Apple's manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, which has been open since 2013, Trump said he was looking at exempting the company from tariffs that have been placed on imports from China as part of the ongoing trade war between the two countries, according to Reuters. The president also asked Cook if the tech giant ""could get ... involved in building 5G in the U.S.""

In August, Fox Business reported that Cook told Trump that Apple's chief smartphone competitor, Samsung, is exempt from U.S. tariffs since its products are made outside of China.

Though there may be overwhelming praise for Cook in his efforts to persuade Trump, not everything he does has been viewed favorably. Only 30.9 percent of those responding to the Blind survey said they ""strongly agreed"" with their CEO participating in the Austin event, held during Trump's impeachment hearings. Twenty-three and a half percent said they ""agreed"" with Cook being there, 10.3 percent ""disagreed,"" 17.7 percent ""strongly disagreed"" and 18 percent were indifferent.

Blind's findings are from more than 100 Apple employees surveyed between Nov. 21 and No. 25, Fortune reported. The anonymous workplace social network confirmed respondents based on their Apple email addresses, noting that more than 50 percent of the company's employees on the social network identify themselves as engineers.

APPLE DELVES FURTHER INTO HEALTH AMBITIONS WITH NEW RESEARCH APP, HEALTH STUDIES

The two men have had a relationship seemingly since the start of Trump's presidency, one that has seemingly only grown over time.

In March, Trump said that Cook had “become a friend of mine"" during a meeting for the president's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. Separately during that meeting, Trump mistakenly called Cook ""Tim Apple"" in a slip of the tongue. Cook later decided to have a bit of fun at the president's expense, changing the name of his Twitter account to Tim Apple.

The 58-year-old Cook is one of the few CEOs in America with a direct line to Trump, according to an October report in The Wall Street Journal. “He’s [Cook] a great executive,” The Journal quoted Trump as saying, with the president adding “[o]thers go out and hire very expensive consultants. Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.”

TIM COOK, IN APPARENT JAB AT TRUMP, CHANGES HIS NAME TO TIM APPLE

Trump has also tweeted directly to Cook, including once in October when he asked the Alabama native to bring back the iPhone's home button.

Silicon Valley, regarded as a hotbed for liberalism, has often been at odds with many of the Trump administration's policies, including its stance on immigration, climate change and trade.

Fortune, citing political donations website OpenSecrets.org, notes that Apple's own employees have donated more money to Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals — including more than $88,000 to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-Vt. and more than $68,000 to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Ma. — than to Trump himself, at just $5,100.

Cook, on the other hand, has often spoken directly with Trump or one of his advisers, when issues such as climate change, trade policy or others affect the company.

During his January 2018 State of the Union address, Trump, who has repeatedly said “trade wars are good and easy to win,"" specifically mentioned that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would invest $350 billion in the U.S. and hire an additional 20,000 workers.

In April 2018, Larry Kudlow, Trump's director of the National Economic Council, specifically mentioned that Cook loved the tax cuts the Trump administration enacted in 2017.

“He said it’s great for business,"" Kudlow told CNBC at the time. ""And Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.”

In addition to widespread poverty, insufficient health care and a host of other challenges, Native American communities in our country face persistent, egregious violence. In fact, Attorney General William Barr this week has done the country a badly needed service by pointing out that there is a virtual war against Native American women.

Before you think “war” is too strong a term, consider these facts.

ELIZABETH WARREN INTRODUCES BILL TO REVOKE MEDALS OF HONOR AWARDED FOR WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE

According to The Associated Press, the Urban Indian Health Institute reported 5,712 indigenous women were murdered or went missing in 2016 alone. Of that staggering number, only 116 were listed in a U.S. Department of Justice database tracking such statistics.

Further, the National Institute of Justice estimated that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lives – and more than half experienced sexual violence.

No American can be comfortable with a level of violence that affects more than 1 million women. It should be completely unacceptable that of the 5,712 cases of missing and murdered Native American girls, only 2 percent – one out of every 50 cases – makes it to the Justice Department database.

According to Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is himself a tribal member, 2016 National Institute of Justice reports reveal even more grim figures – estimating that more than four out of five Native American women have experienced violence, with more than half experiencing sexual violence.

As Cole put it: “Native women are more than one-and-a-half times more likely than White women to have experienced violence in the past year. Even more chilling, Native women face murder rates more than 10 times the national average in some parts of the country.”

Cole went on to point out that 96 percent of those who had been sexually assaulted were attacked by non-Native Americans.

Cole and others are taking steps to protect Native American girls and women.

As Cole wrote recently:

“I was proud to join with several of my House colleagues to introduce the Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safety (BADGES) for Native Communities Act. This bipartisan legislation addresses inefficiencies in federal criminal databases and increases tribal access to those databases.

“In response to the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, the BADGES Act also rightly seeks to improve public data on those cases while promoting more efficient recruitment and retention of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) law enforcement. Moreover, the legislation would provide tribes with resources to improve public safety coordination between their governments, states and federal agencies.”

Take a minute this holiday season while celebrating with family and friends and let your representative and your senators know that you want action taken to protect these vulnerable girls and women.

ICE ARRESTS 90 FOREIGN STUDENTS AT FAKE MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY

In total, 250 students have been arrested in connection to the fake University of Farmington. When the university and associated arrests were reported on in January of 2019, federal prosecutors alleged the students had knowingly enrolled in the fake school in order to maintain their student visa status.

“Each of the foreign citizens who ‘enrolled’ and made ‘tuition’ payments to the University knew that they would not attend any actual classes, earn credits, or make academic progress toward an actual degree in a particular field of study,” the indictments read, according to The New York Times.

The Detroit News reported that Homeland Security agents started posing as university officials in 2017, but the university initially opened in 2015 as part of ""Paper Chase"" -- an undercover operation geared toward exposing recruiters engaging in immigration fraud.

Federal officials reportedly also arrested 21 people on visa fraud, using the fraudulent University of Northern New Jersey in 2016.

The vast majority (80 percent) of the arrests in Michigan resulted in ""voluntary departure"" from the United States, according to the Detroit Free Press. The remaining students either received an order for removal, contested their removal, or filed for relief.

While many progressive complaints didn't specifically blame the Trump administration, the incident highlighted how Trump has repeatedly been attacked for tactics used or supported by his predecessor. Ocasio-Cortez has also clarified that she opposed Obama's immigration policies.

Most recently, several media organizations were forced to make retractions after falsely attributing an Obama-era migrant child-detention statistic to President Trump.

Manfred Nowak, an expert from the U.N. Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, claimed that 100,000 migrant children were detained by the Trump administration and indicated that it was the ""world's highest rate"" of detained children. The following day, however, Nowak acknowledged that the cited number was from 2015, under President Obama.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly,” Kelly Mehlenbacher, then the state operations director for Harris’ campaign, said in the letter obtained by The New York Times. “While I still believe that Senator Harris is the strongest candidate to win in the General Election in 2020, I no longer have confidence in our campaign or its leadership.”

HARRIS AIDES BELIEVE GABBARD ATTACKS ACCELERATED 2020 WOES: REPORT

She went on to criticize the campaign in blistering terms for pushing staffers to move to Baltimore, only to let them go without notice.

“It is not acceptable to me that we encouraged people to move from Washington, DC to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice, with no plan for the campaign, and without thoughtful consideration of the personal consequences to them or the consequences that their absence would have on the remaining staff,” the letter says.

Mehlenbacher has since joined former New York City Michael Bloomberg's campaign, joining as deputy chief operating officer. She had previously worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.

The letter forms part of an in-depth report, featuring interviews with dozens of current and former aides, by the Times. The article marks how Harris, once surging at the top of the polls, has since plummeted amid a reportedly dysfunctional and often headless campaign.

BLOOMBERG PILFERS TOP HARRIS CAMPAIGN AIDE

The article points to a campaign that has not been able to afford TV advertising and has struggled to handle attacks from other Democrats, such as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez issued a statement to the Times.

""Our team, from the candidate to organizers across the country, are working day in and out to make sure Kamala is the nominee to take on Donald Trump and end the national nightmare that is his presidency,” he said. “Just like every campaign, we have made tough decisions to have the resources we need to place in Iowa and springboard into the rest of the primary calendar.”

According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the nomination, Harris was in second place in early July, commanding an average of 15 percent of primary voters. But since then, she has declined quickly.

Now, RCP polls have her with an average of just under 4 percent — far behind candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden (27 percent), Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (18.3 percent), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (15.8 percent), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (11 percent)."

Elizabeth Warren has a message for those attacking her as angry: Yes, she is.

On Friday afternoon, the Massachusetts Democrat, in a fundraising email for her presidential campaign, addressed the innuendo stoked this week by former Vice President Joe Biden and others who have cast her as a elitist ideologue.

""I am angry and I own it,"" the subject line read.

""Over and over,"" Warren wrote below, ""we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.""

It was the most direct response to -- and an embrace of -- an attack launched by Biden in a Medium post on Tuesday in which he assailed the senator, without naming names, over her suggestion that his arguments against ""Medicare for All"" sounded like they were coming from a candidate ""running in the wrong presidential primary.""

In her response, Warren also made explicit what many of her supporters have suggested in recent days: that recent criticisms lodged against her by rivals like Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have a sexist edge to them.

Both have singled out Warren for taking a ""my way or the highway"" approach to her campaign. On Tuesday, Biden wrote that Warren's remarks accusing him of employing ""Republican talking points"" against Medicare for All suggested a more damning analysis.

""These kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,"" the former vice president wrote, before describing Warren's ""approach to politics"" as ""condescending"" and elitist.

The word that jumped off the screen to many Democrats -- and a lot of women: ""angry."" Almost immediately, a series of writers and pundits zeroed in on and denounced the phrasing as sexist -- which, to many observers of her campaign, seemed odd, if not plainly misleading.

""This is not an endorsement of Elizabeth Warren the candidate, but an affirmation of who I know her to be. Anyone falsely casting her as angry & antagonistic is telegraphing the limits of their minds, & the magnitude of their insecurities,"" wrote journalist Connie Schultz , who is the wife of Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

'That has nothing to do with it'

In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Friday, after Warren's email landed, Biden denied that he had characterized his rival for the nomination as angry because of her gender.

""The strong women in my life are angry -- they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,"" he said.

Criticizing her in terms used to denigrate women, Biden added, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""It had nothing to do with that,"" the former vice president said. ""It had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.""

The Biden campaign's view -- and those of his close allies, men and women -- is that Warren threw the first punch, during the health care dust-up, and he is merely answering her remarks.

Warren's initial comment about running in the ""wrong presidential primary"" was ""absurd, because Joe Biden has served this country honorably -- he's been a Democrat his entire life,"" said senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders, baking in an implicit jab at Warren's decision, in 1996, to switch her registration from Republican to Democrat.

""This has been and is about health care, and we want to be able to have a high-level policy conversation,"" Sanders said. ""And as Democrats, we should be able to disagree without asserting that someone doesn't know what they're talking about or should be kicked out of the party or is corrupt.""

The Warren campaign, which has made it a practice from the starting line not to swat at every provocation, opted against putting out a direct reply to Biden's initial criticism. Instead, her team amplified some of the ambient online criticism and appeared poised, at least until Friday afternoon, to leave it at that.

Despite the more forward wording, Warren's email offered a different flavor of the same message she regularly delivers to supporters on the campaign trail. Lines in the email detailing her anger ""on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump's government, our rigged economy, and business as usual,"" were nearly indistinguishable from her stump speech.

Her frustration, Warren has said throughout the campaign, does not hold some distorting grip on her politics.

""I don't propose a wealth tax because I'm cranky,"" she said during a rally in Seattle this summer, a line she often repeats now on the stump, sometimes smiling broadly for effect. ""I don't propose it because I'm mad at anybody.""

This is the narrow line Warren has been made to walk throughout the campaign. Polling over the course of the past 10 months suggests she has successfully charted the path. Warren tops a number of early-state polls and is regularly found to be among the leaders when voters are asked to name their second-choice candidates.

'A smarty britches'

Still, the prospect of a Warren presidency has provoked anxiety and attacks from those opposed to her politics, and, quite literally, brought at least one grown man to the brink of tears.

""I don't need Elizabeth Warren, or the government, giving away my money,"" billionaire former hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman told CNBC earlier this week, his eyes watering, when the conversation turned to Warren's signature wealth tax.

Cooperman is one in a growing crowd of powerful men -- including some campaign rivals -- to paint Warren, who has campaigned on a populist promise to tax the rich in order to fund an ambitious suite of social programs, as angry or vindictive.

Asked this week if he would ever discuss tax policy with Warren, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: ""I'm not sure how open-minded she is ... or that she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.""

Before he bowed out of the race, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas suggested that Warren ""is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other"" than ""lifting people up.""

A source close to Biden's campaign described the new tone of attacks on Warren coming from him and his team as intentional in a different way: to communicate the message that ""Warren is a smarty britches who thinks if you don't agree with her, you're an idiot.""

Faced with accusations, amplified on social media by Warren's campaign during the week, over what some saw as sexist attacks, Biden's campaign also pointed to examples of him using the same words and phrases to criticize men -- including the time he called John McCain an ""angry man"" and ""a little more angry than he usually is"" in 2008, before labeling Mitt Romney an ""elitist"" in 2012.

Carol Moseley Braun, a Biden-supporting former senator from Illinois, said she's known the former vice president since the 1990s and has seen ""nothing, zero, zippo, to suggest this man has got a sexist bone in his body. I just haven't.""

""I don't think it's so much gendered criticism as it is a stupid argument, and you can quote me on that,"" she said. ""It's a silly argument, as far as I'm concerned. The fact is that Sen. Warren is entitled to her position, VP Biden is entitled to his position and they're not going to be the same position -- they're different candidates.""

She also alluded to Biden's implicit digs at Warren for being a registered Republican until the 1990s.

""To have somebody that just came around beating up on (Biden), to me, is just insulting,"" she said.

Biden's campaign also needled the Warren campaign for its response to his comments -- which during the week largely came through retweeting women and progressive activists who were critical.

""Donald Trump has already tried to extort a foreign country into intervening in this election, and we fought back. In his attempts to get reelected, no dirty trick will be off limits and no stone left unturned,"" said spokesman Andrew Bates. ""Anyone who thinks they will be able to simply subtweet their way to victory against Donald Trump is flat-out wrong."""

The state's early deadline to qualify for the ballot forced a surprise decision this week: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is expected to file to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in Alabama -- ensuring that he wouldn't be left off the ballot there.

The news came right after Jeff Sessions , the former Alabama senator and US attorney general, launched a bid to challenge Democratic Sen. Doug Jones for his old Senate seat -- defying the wishes of his former boss, President Donald Trump.

Trump, meanwhile, is set to head to Alabama this weekend. He'll attend the University of Alabama's home football game against Louisiana State University -- a match-up between the Associated Press' No. 1 and No. 2-ranked teams in the country.

His visit comes shortly after newly released internal documents revealed that the government weather forecasters who swatted down his incorrect claim that Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama did so without realizing he was the source of the misinformation.

The odd confluence of events has placed Alabama at the forefront of national politics late this week, and raised a series of questions for which the answers will unfold in the coming months.

Among them: How will Bloomberg, a billionaire many times over who is willing to spend his own money on a centrist campaign, change the Democratic presidential race? And can Sessions, who was fired by Trump, co-exist with his former boss -- or will Trump hammer his former attorney general so hard that Sessions loses the primary or Jones keeps his seat in the general election?

""We're like the center of the maelstrom of this episode of 'As American Burns,'"" said David Mowery, an Alabama-based political consultant who has worked for candidates in both parties.

Alabama isn't a stranger to this role. In late 2017, the special election for Sessions' former Senate seat there dominated headlines. The race in the deep-red state was competitive largely because Roy Moore, the controversial former judge who won the Republican nomination, was imploding amid numerous allegations that he sexually assaulted teens while in his 30s. Those allegations, which Moore denied, cost the GOP the seat in a December 2017 special election.

The series of events on the GOP side can be traced back to the early stages of the 2016 Republican primary, when Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump.

""It all kind of starts with 2015: Trump has a rally in Mobile with Jeff Sessions. And that was the spark that lit the flame that propelled him to the nomination, to the presidency,"" Mowery said.

Trump fired Sessions in November 2018, blaming the Alabama Republican for recusing himself in the Russia probe and allowing special counsel Robert Mueller to be appointed. A month after the firing, Trump tweeted, ""Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!""

When asked on the White House lawn by CNN on Friday if he would endorse Sessions, Trump said, ""I saw he said very nice things about me last night, but we'll have to see.""

Trump's comments come after Sessions tried to ease tensions with Trump. Despite Trump firing him and publicly, and repeatedly, lambasting him by saying he'd made a mistake choosing him as attorney general, Sessions released a video expressing his continued support of the President.

""When I left President Trump's Cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the President? Nope,"" Sessions said in a video released by his campaign Thursday as he entered the Senate race. ""Have I said a cross word about President Trump? Not one time. And I'll tell you why: First, that would be dishonorable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. Second, the President is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support.""

Later in the video, Sessions said: ""When President Trump took on Washington, only one senator out of 100 had the courage to stand with him: me. I was the first to support President Trump. I was his strongest advocate. I still am.""

But the Alabama GOP Senate primary field is already crowded, with Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne, secretary of state John Merrill, former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville and Moore.

And Sessions' entrance doesn't appear to have chased off anyone.

""It's going to be hard to get elected in a Republican primary in Alabama when a Republican president with over 90% approval rating among primary voters has said just the last few weeks that Jeff Sessions is an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama. He's going to have a hard time with that,"" Byrne told reporters in Alabama this week

It's all coming to a head around a college football game for primacy in the Southeastern Conference, with Trump on hand.

""That game alone would be huge,"" Mowery said. ""You layer the president over it. And then you've got this whole subplot of Sessions, the president's bête noire, jumping in.""

""The Bloomberg thing is just a whole 'nother level of bananas,"" he said.

Bloomberg this week sent aides to collect the signatures required to qualify for the Alabama ballot for the state's primary on Super Tuesday -- March 3. Next week, he'll need to file in Arkansas and New Hampshire.

Those early deadlines mean potential last-minute entrants into the 2020 presidential race were essentially out of time to make up their minds.

Alabama could be a competitive state in the Democratic primary. Along with other southern states, its Democratic electorate is largely black -- a constituency that former Vice President Joe Biden has performed strongly with as he competes with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the top tier of national polls.

That primary in Alabama would take place on the same day as the GOP's Senate primary.

""It seems like it's just going to get crazier from here,"" Mowery said."

(CNN) There will come a day when Donald J. Trump is no longer the President of the United States. For hopeful Democrats, that day can't come soon enough; for the millions of Americans who comprise Trump's base, he deserves to be President for two full terms -- if not more.

While no one can predict how long Trump remains in the Oval Office, it's safe to say his successor will face a challenge unlike any other in the modern era.

As the country careens towards impeachment, the US faces a pivotal moment in history. Even if the Republican-controlled Senate does not vote to convict and remove the President, the proceedings will inevitably stretch our country's political divide into a gaping chasm in ways we have not seen for generations.

Michael Bloomberg -- the no-nonsense businessman who righted New York City after the September 11 attacks -- is reportedly weighing whether to throw his hat in the ring . While Bloomberg may choose to enter the Democratic presidential primary with less than one year to go until Election Day 2020, he is precisely the elixir that America needs to heal itself in a post-Trump world.

Who fares a better chance at uniting the country than a man who has registered as a Democrat, Republican, and Independent? What candidate is better positioned to restore faith in the media than someone who founded a global news organization that is seen as politically neutral? Who else has both the serene disposition and the courage to take on big global issues with bold moves?"

“I am angry and I own it,” Warren declared in an email blast on Friday. However, her response was not geared toward her GOP foe, President Trump. Rather, it was a response to the recent remarks, primarily, from Biden.

The back and forth began following the rollout of Warren’s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan. Biden’s campaign immediately shredded what it called the “mathematical gymnastics” used in the proposal. Warren responded to the critique, calling out Biden by name and suggesting that he was using “Republican talking points.”

“Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don’t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,” she told reporters:

Biden responded in a Medium post on Tuesday, defending his record of fighting for the Democrat Party.

“The other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,” he began, addressing Warren without mentioning her name:

But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn’t agree with you — it’s not just that you disagree — that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.

Warren hit back on Friday, subtly attributing his response to sexism.

“Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,” Warren’s email read.

The former vice president denied the implication during an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Friday.

“The strong women in my life are angry — they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,” he explained.

“It had nothing to do with that,” he continued. “It had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.”"

The former New York City mayor is actively preparing to enter the presidential race “designating himself as a candidate in at least one state with an early filing deadline,” the New York Times reported Thursday. However, the paper quoted an advisor who indicated that Bloomberg has yet to make an official decision.

Warren, who has championed her “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” took a shot at the billionaire following the report, encouraging him to fill out her calculator “for the billionaires.”

“Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you’re looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here,” she wrote, providing a link to her calculator:

“Some billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth’s Ultra-Millionaire Tax. Don’t worry, now we have a calculator for that too,” Warren’s website states.

The calculator asks the user if he or she is a billionaire. If the user chooses “no,” the calculator provides a list of well-known billionaires and encourages the user to “pick a billionaire to see how much they would pay under Elizabeth’s wealth tax.” Bloomberg is included on the list.

“MIKE BLOOMBERG WOULD PAY $3.079 BILLION NEXT YEAR UNDER ELIZABETH’S WEALTH TAX,” her calculator states in all caps.

It adds:

Mike Bloomberg has a net worth of $52,000,000,000. Don’t worry too much about Mike Bloomberg – if history is any guide, if billionaires do nothing other than invest their wealth in the stock market, it’s likely that their wealth will continue to grow. Elizabeth’s wealth tax, which only impacts America’s 75,000 wealthiest families, would generate enough revenue to cover universal child care, quality public education, forgive student loan debt, provide free public college, and help finance Medicare for All.

As reported in October, Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton have been reportedly keeping an eye on the Democrat primary, although many Democrats believe neither would officially jump into the race unless Joe Biden (D) flounders."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday floated two potential individuals she would consider including in her administration, both of whom would violate her pledge to stand against lobbyists and giant firms.

However, giving either of the individuals a position in her administration would call her hardline stance on standing up to both lobbyists and big firms into question.

Patrick, for example, joined Bain Capital in 2015 and serves as a “Managing Director and Co-Managing Partner of the Double Impact business,” according to his bio on the Bain Capital website.

Patrick defended his role in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper last year.

“I’m having a terrific time in this fund that we launched,” Patrick stated. “It’s a fund that invests in companies in order to drive social and environmental impact, and it’s part of this impact investing industry or trend.”

“One of my partners describes … impact investing as the laboratory where capitalists work to reform capitalism,” he added:

Meanwhile, Barnes has an extensive history of lobbying, doing so in 2003 and 2004 “for liberal advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the American Constitution Society and the Center for Reproductive Rights,” as Politico and other outlets reported:

Worth noting that the two people @ewarren floated as potential cabinet members today have worked in industries she regularly slams on the trail as “corrupt.” @DevalPatrick is a managing director an Bane Capital and @MelodyCBarnes lobbied in 2003-04 for liberal advocacy groups https://t.co/GPKUlbCfk1 — Zak Hudak (@cbszak) November 7, 2019

This stands in stark contrast with the hardline positions Warren outlines in her sweeping anti-corruption plan, which devotes a significant portion to lobbyist activities and what the presidential hopeful calls the “revolving door between government and giant, dominant firms.”

“We’ve seen the issue of industry lobbyists and top execs spinning freely through the revolving door to and from important government positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations,” Warren wrote.

She continued:

But giant corporations should compete on a level playing field – and they shouldn’t be able to rig the system by scooping up every available former government official in an effort to get federal regulators off their backs. That’s why I have put forward proposals to get big money out of politics and to end lobbying as we know it – and it’s why I’m going further to slam shut the revolving door between government and giant, dominant firms.

This would not be the first time Warren has faced a contradiction in her rhetoric and actions. Her campaign is funded, in part, by $10.4 million from her senatorial campaign. At the time, she happily courted big donors and received at least $95,000 from “various lobbyists,” as CNBC reported.

In May, Warren threw support behind Sen. Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) Democrat challenger Jaime Harrison, a former corporate lobbyist who worked for the Podesta Group from 2008-2016:

Jaime Harrison will fight hard for the people of South Carolina and take our country forward. Go Jaime! https://t.co/pY5keteN1i — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) May 30, 2019

In September, Warren tapped former Planned Parenthood leader Kimberly Diaz Scott, who registered as a lobbyist, to head up her presidential campaign in Florida."

All of this comes as speculation builds that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee, may run again in 2020 as well.

Holder did very publicly flirt with running in 2020 before, even making the rounds to travel to some early presidential states for key speeches, but he ultimately announced earlier this year he would not run. In March 2019, he came out and said he would not be running in 2020 and that he planned to instead focus his efforts on redistricting efforts.

But now, given how weak the rest of the Democrat presidential field is in 2020, and with other top talent showing that the water is definitely still warm, Holder appears to be reconsidering and thinking about getting into the race after all.

Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reported late Thursday evening that Holder has been discussing a late entrance into the crowded Democrat field with a handful of close advisers and political consultants:

It gets even more interesting. I hear from a good source that Eric Holder has been consulting strategists about possibly jumping into the Dem presidential race. NYT reports Michael Bloomberg is seriously considering a late entry as well. — Eugene Robinson (@Eugene_Robinson) November 7, 2019

The news that Holder is reconsidering his decision to bow out on 2020 comes as Bloomberg has filed paperwork in Alabama, which has a Friday filing deadline, to run for president. He has not yet, according to multiple reports, made a decision on whether he will run for president or not, but filing paperwork in Alabama ensures he would have a shot at ballot access there should he mount a national campaign for the Democrat nomination.

Politico reported Thursday night:

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing to file paperwork to qualify for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, ahead of a Friday deadline. The move would be a first step toward a national campaign, though Bloomberg has not made a final decision to run.

Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson is quoted in the story as well, suggesting that Bloomberg is actively considering jumping into the still-crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field. Wolfson said:

We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated — but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that. If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America’s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America’s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist.

All of this comes as Clinton, whom some have speculated may get in herself, again toyed with the idea publicly during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin this week and then tweeted video of the joke:

You heard it here first: Not taking up professional running anytime soon.pic.twitter.com/dH2I4ZvMcZ — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 7, 2019

Clinton, Bloomberg, and now Holder all considering late entrances to the crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field comes as its onetime frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has proven particularly weak against his opponents.

Biden’s deep corruption concerns with regard to his son Hunter Biden’s business dealing in Ukraine and China, and potentially elsewhere around the world in shoes yet to drop, have Democrats concerned that a much more radical leftist like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) could win the Democrat nomination.

While the hard left of the Democrat Party led by the so-called “Squad” believes that nominating a leftist socialist like Sanders or Warren would energize the party’s base and bring an army to take on President Donald Trump and his base in November 2020, more establishment Democrats are concerned that Warren or Sanders being the nominee would turn off battleground voters and cede the White House back to Trump in 2020.

Most of the “Squad,” Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) endorsed Sanders since the last Democrat debate in October, while the freshman group’s fourth member Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) endorsed Warren. Members have insisted there is no divide in the group.

Biden’s polling numbers have steadily sunk in recent months, to the point where he has lost the frontrunner status he enjoyed at the beginning of his campaign. Warren has replaced Biden as the frontrunner in many national polls, and especially in several key battleground states. Biden’s numbers keep slipping as the public learns more and more about his son’s position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where he was paid more than $80,000 per month.

Questionable Hunter Biden dealings in China, too, have put a spotlight on Biden corruption concerns, all of which in their totality are a nearly daily national news story given the fact that House Democrats have decided to proceed with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over the fact that Trump asked Ukraine’s new president to investigate corruption including what happened with Hunter Biden and Burisma.

If Bloomberg or Clinton decided to launch national presidential campaigns in the next few weeks, they would have considerable resources at the ready. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has immense financial resources at his disposal, while Clinton as the party’s nominee in 2016 and the former first lady, as well as a leader with a national profile and universal name identification among voters, would quickly be able to assemble the structures necessary to compete in the upcoming primaries and caucuses.

Holder, though, may have a rougher go of it given that he’s never run a national campaign before and does not have the financial resources of Bloomberg:

Mike Bloomberg has $50 billion. what’s Eric Holder’s theory of how he’d build a campaign at the last minute? https://t.co/Mb9bkawBVG — Josh Barro (@jbarro) November 8, 2019

Holder does have deep ties to former President Barack Obama, however, and is considered a favorite among the Democrat base given the work he did to help Obama cover up a variety of scandals, including most notably the Operation Fast and Furious scandal.

Holder’s coverup of documents on behalf of Obama, who asserted executive privilege to withhold the information from Congress, led to him being the first-ever and only sitting Attorney General of the United States to be held in contempt of Congress. The U.S. House in 2012 voted Holder into both civil and criminal contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious scandal, just one of many scandals that plagued Holder’s Department of Justice."

There is no shortage of candidates in the current Democrat primary field. Democrats have, on paper, everything they have claimed to want in terms of diversity in their lineup.

They have multiple women — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and self-help guru Marianne Williamson (D). They have candidates who represent racial minorities — Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Julián Castro (D) — as well as a candidate who embodies their self-proclaimed devotion to the LGBT community.

Yet, despite that, Democrat elites like Clinton are unsatisfied, indicating a deepening divide within the Democrat Party.

The first presidential primary is less than three months away, yet select Democrats are still mulling a last-minute run. On Thursday, reports indicated that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama, with sources adding that he is “close” to coming up with a final decision on a presidential bid.

Similarly, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly considering a long-shot bid, and Hillary Clinton has been teasing a run for weeks, failing to use her recent interviews to quash the rumors.

It has been widely believed among Democrats that Bloomberg and Clinton would not run unless Biden, who was long believed to be the unshakeable frontrunner, showed signs of wavering. Both Warren and Sanders have managed to put a dent in his support, keeping potential candidates like Clinton on the fence and prepared to pounce.

Bloomberg’s, Holder’s, and Clinton’s purported considerations speak volumes about the state of the current Democrat field. Democrat elites are unsatisfied with the choices, fearing Biden’s lack of stamina in a general election matchup against Trump and questioning the electability of Warren and Sanders, who have unabashedly embraced far-left proposals and positions that strategic Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have long attempted to keep at bay.

Clinton has openly criticized the positions of Warren and Sanders, causing some to wonder if she is subtly attempting to undermine the field or in the very least, influence the candidates’ positions.

She appeared at the New York Times’ DealBook conference this week and took aim at ultra-wealthy tax proposals and Medicare for All — two progressive plans both Warren and Sanders not only support, but champion.

“I just don’t understand how that could work, and I don’t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,” Clinton said of the wealth tax proposals, calling them “complicated.”

“If you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets … how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,” she said.

“But assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,” she continued.

“That would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,” she added.

Clinton also expressed doubt that Warren’s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan would ever pass.

“No, I don’t,” Clinton replied when asked if she thought Warren’s plan would pass. “I don’t, but the goal is the right goal. ”

“I believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have, a public option is something I’ve been in favor of for a very long time. I don’t believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100 percent coverage and deal with costs,” she added.

Clinton has also taken direct aim at candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), calling her a “favorite of the Russians” and suggesting that she is a “Russian asset.”

“They [Republicans] know they can’t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it’s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,” Clinton said on the Campaign HQ podcast with Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe last month.

Time and time again, rather than encouraging Democrats to rally behind a candidate in the existing presidential primary field, Clinton has subtly hinted that she could jump in the race instead.

In October, President Trump tweeted that “Crooked Hillary” should join the race “to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren” as long as she explains “all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

Clinton replied, “Don’t tempt me. Do your job,” and fueled further speculation during an appearance on PBS NewsHour.

“Maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,” she said. “But, just seriously, I don’t understand. I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.”

Clinton kicked off an additional 2020 buzz on social media after posting a quote from Beyoncé about the need to “take” power:

The twice-failed presidential candidate’s book tour has almost doubled as an outlet to express her views on the 2020 race. She dropped yet another doubtful analysis of the current 2020 field during an event at Portland’s Revolution Hall last month, suggesting that it would be nearly impossible for anyone in the current field to unseat Trump in the next election in the event that he is not impeached.

“It’s hard to know who’s going to be the best candidate to beat this president, assuming this president is still running,” she said.

She continued:

We have a number of very able, very admirable candidates who are vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of forecasters who are saying, ‘Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he’s not impeached, or he’s impeached but not convicted, it’s going to be very, very hard,’ because of all of the advantages that he will have on the stuff we were just talking about like suppression and everything else.

Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has done little to extinguish the mounting rumors, explaining that his wife “may or may not ever run for anything” during an appearance at Georgetown Law’s second annual Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lecture in Washington, DC, last month.

Most recently, Clinton dodged a question on whether she is planning a last-minute jump into the race, reverting to jogging jokes at the New York Times’ DealBook conference.

“I’m sorry, to run? You know, I have always been a very, very slow runner. I am embarrassingly slow,” she said, continuing her bit.

“There’s been some teasing and some hinting that, maybe, you’re sitting off in the wings here and waiting for some moment,” Andrew Ross Sorkin said.

Clinton, however, refused to answer the question directly:

You heard it here first: Not taking up professional running anytime soon.pic.twitter.com/dH2I4ZvMcZ — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 7, 2019

Look, I think I would have been a really good president. I think I could have been a very effective leader. We have real divides in the country over all kinds of things, but I certainly, in my time in the Senate and secretary of state, worked really hard, as you say, to actually solve problems, not exacerbate them or ignore them. I would have done everything I could to try to get us positioned for the future. That’s what a leader is supposed to do. Elections are supposed to be about the future and leadership should be about the future. I think I could have done a really good job. I think the last election was deeply flawed and that there were so many unprecedented problems in that election that it’s almost hard to make sense of.

Sources for both the New York Times and Washington Post have said that Clinton has not ruled out a presidential bid and is actively keeping an eye on it, which is overwhelmingly evident to those who have been tracking her latest remarks.

The possible late entrances — from Clinton, Bloomberg, and Holder — indicate the growing worry over not only the direction of the Democrat field but the Democrat Party’s ability to defeat Trump in 2020. While Democrat voters are more open to radical policies, such as Medicare for All and multitrillion dollar proposals to combat climate change, there are growing concerns that those proposals will not bode well for the left in a general election matchup.

Despite that, Sanders, who remains a top-tier candidate, is boldly running with his multitrillion-dollar, big government proposals and has garnered support from three individuals largely demonstrative of the ideological divide within the party: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).

Ocasio-Cortez’s infamous feud with Pelosi over the summer was almost a foreshadowing of the internal strife to be seen within the Democrat Party in the presidential primary. There is an ongoing, although largely unsaid, matchup between establishment Democrats and the unabashedly socialist “new” left. Ultimately, the Democrat establishment worries the progressive flank will hand Trump, and his MAGA agenda, four more years in the White House."

If that is not interesting enough for you, since this poll was taken in late September, Trump’s numbers have improved… Previously, he was at 43 percent favorable, 56 percent unfavorable.

And guess whose numbers got worse, and I mean a whole lot worse… Yep, Slow Joe Biden’s… Which, once again, proves that the Ukrainian torpedoes aimed at the Bad Orange Man went off course and nailed Old Joe.

In September, before we learned how Joe and his son Hunter looted at least two foreign countries, Joe sat at 46 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable. That’s a loss of eight net points while Trump gained three points.

Granted, Trump is more upside-down than Biden, but only by three points (10 to 7), which is well within the margin of error. Buttigieg is also upside down by seven points, while Bernie is buried by 13 points and Kamala by 19 points — which is an accurate reflection of just how awful she is.

One warning sign for Trump is that only 42 percent of those polled believe he deserves reelection, while 55 percent do not want him reelected. But even on this point, since September, Trump has improved from a 39 to 57 percent response. So he has been gaining ground … during impeachment!

But here’s the other thing…

Even if 55 percent of the country wants Trump replaced in 2020, they have to replace him with someone else. There has to be an acceptable alternative, and what we have here is a Democrat field so weak, so extreme and unappealing, Big Guns like Michael Bloomberg and Eric Holder are seriously considering jumping in at this very late date.

As far as impeachment, despite 24/7 negative news coverage and selective leaks, this pig just isn’t going to fly.

“It’s important not to read too much into differences within the margin of error. But the fact that there is no significant change in the current results suggests that the opening salvo of the House impeachment inquiry has had little impact on the overall 2020 dynamic. Voter opinion remains baked in,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

Ya think?

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Trump currently enjoys a relatively healthy job approval rating of 44 percent, and the polls gauging impeachment have either stalled or are losing altitude. Monmouth has Trump’s job approval at 45 percent.

Most telling, at least in my opinion, is that impeachment has not boosted the cable news ratings. Far-left CNN is actually attracting fewer viewers when compared to last year. This shows an extraordinary amount of voter indifference towards impeachment. Americans just don’t see impeachment as a big deal, as anything more than just another partisan food fight.

If voters believed there was an actual crime here, cable news ratings would be through the roof, and Trump’s favorability, reelect, and job approval ratings would not be on the upswing.

Bottom line: this is the media fail of all media fails.

Earlier this year, Bloomberg backed away from a presidential run after clashing with left-wing Democrats. He said that while he could defeat President Donald Trump, he had doubts about the primary: “I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,” he wrote.

At the time, Bloomberg went further, arguing that “until 2021, and possibly longer, our only real hope for progress lies outside of Washington.” He pledged to continue to devote himself to cherished causes, such as gun control and climate change (which he has pursued by literally paying the salaries of state prosecutors around the country). The mayor who tried to ban large sodas and claims China’s Xi Jinping is “not a dictator” was bearish about his chances.

Left unsaid at the time was the fact that former Vice President Joe Biden had entered the race, making it harder for Bloomberg and other so-called “moderates” to join. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who had also toyed with an independent run for president, likewise deferred and then declined to run.

Biden, though nearing 80, was the heir apparent to Obama’s donors, if not his endorsement. The party establishment realized it had to stay united to win.

But then Biden began to falter — first in the debates, where he was embarrassed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for his collegiality with former segregationists, and then in the polls.

While still nominally the nationwide frontrunner , Biden has lost ground to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). In a recent Iowa poll, Biden was in fourth place — even losing to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has surged to second there.

Moreover, Biden has also lost the battle for the soul of the party. Radical socialist policies have become the default among Democrat activists. Both Warren and Sanders back “Medicare for All,” a government takeover of health care that would cost $52 trillion under Warren’s plan. She denies that her plan would impose new taxes on middle class families, but Sanders, whose plan has been costed at a mere $32 trillion, openly and proudly admits that it would.

In January, when “Medicare for All” moved to the fore — thanks in part to the efforts of newly-elected “democratic socialist” Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) — Bloomberg told New Hampshire voters frankly: “You could never afford that, you’re talking about trillions of dollars.” He also embraced a version of Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal” — but one that he said would be “achievable,” in contrast to her plan to kill the fossil fuel industry.

Bloomberg was incredulous at Democrats’ other policies. He blasted Warren’s “wealth tax” on billionaires such as himself: “If you want to look at a system that’s non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death — it’s called Venezuela,” he said. And: “I’m a little bit tired of listening to things that are pie in the sky, that we never are going to pass or never are going to afford.”

It was Joe Biden’s job to stop all of that, and appeal to Democrats in the “battleground states” who prefer a moderate candidate. But he failed, and none of the other candidates seem to be electable.

That is why Democrats have chosen impeachment: they do not believe their candidates can win.

And it is why Bloomberg is thinking of jumping in — in Alabama, of all places. He like much of America, is voting “no confidence” in the Democratic presidential field.

As of today, Republican enthusiasm sits at 65 percent, compared to 64 percent for Democrats.

You might argue that a single point lead is meaningless. But here’s the rub…

It’s not supposed to be like this.

The party with the incumbent president is almost always running behind in voter enthusiasm. The reasons for this should be obvious: the other side is more juiced to win back the White House.

Back in 2000, when Democrats were coming off two terms of Democrat Bill Clinton, the GOP had a 51 to 39 percent enthusiasm edge — 12 points.

In 2004, when Republican George W. Bush ran for reelection, Democrats had a 73 to 62 percent lead — 11 points.

In 2008, after two Bush terms, Democrats were up 73 to 59 percent — 14 points.

In 2012, as Democrat Barack Obama sought his second term, Republicans were up 70 to 59 — 11 points.

In 2016, after two Obama terms, the GOP was up 51 to 43 — 8 points.

In every case since 2000, the party out of power did not just enjoy a lead in enthusiasm, with the exception of 2016; it enjoyed a double-digit lead. But here we are going into 2020, and the party in power, the GOP, is not only plenty enthusiastic; it is in the lead.

What’s more, we are seeing a big jump since the 2018 midterms, a jump from 51 to 66 for the Republicans and a jump from 48 to 65 percent for Democrats.

So what’s different this time?

A number of things…

Unlike Bush Jr., Trump is determined to hold on to his base. Clinton and Obama governed this way. Bush did not, and the results of that, during his second term (Katrina plus immigration reform), were catastrophic.

Trump has wisely embraced the Clinton/Obama game plan that says you always dance with them that brung ya.

Secondly, of course, is this absurd and outrageous impeachment, which is being exposed every day as a full-blown Deep State-Media-Democrat coup, a straight-up conspiracy, and this is almost certainly creating a rallying effect around Trump.

Finally, the Democrat presidential field is in every way terrible. Former Vice President Joe Biden is too old, represents the past, and not very bright. Elizabeth Warren is a non-starter with her pledge to strip 160 million Americans of their private health insurance as she more than doubles the federal budget with her $52 trillion — with a “T” — Medicare for All fiasco. Bernie Sanders is a 198-year-old commie with a bum ticker.

There is no Barack Obama in this field. There is no Ronald Reagan. There is no Bill Clinton. There is no Donald Trump. There is no superstar who screams This Is the Future — just a bunch of old socialists. Alphas win presidential elections, and there is not an alpha in the bunch.

On paper, and until she opens her mouth, Kamala Harris looks every inch the superstar. But she flamed out as soon as the spotlight revealed her crippling flaws and lack of intelligence.

A word of caution: we don’t know what this poll will look like a year from now. Nevertheless, it is more than noteworthy now, and it is difficult to imagine a scenario, other than a deep recession, that changes these numbers. But with most economic indicators on the upswing, a recession seems less likely than it did three months ago when the media were literally begging for a recession.

In fact, it is much easier to game out scenarios where enthusiasm for Trump actually increases, especially if Democrats jump off that cliff and vote to impeach. This impeachment process is such an outrageous and infuriating abuse of power, so obscenely anti-democratic, and Trump will continue to be effective at communicating that point.

It is also worth pointing out that this enthusiasm poll did not predict the outcome of the 2004 and 2012 elections. Democrats had an 11-point lead in ’04, and Democrat John Kerry still lost to Bush. Republicans also had an 11-point lead in 2012, and Republican Mitt Romney still lost to Obama.

But this might also reveal a couple of things in Trump’s favor: 1) it is difficult to knock out an incumbent president and 2) candidates matter. Kerry and Romney were terrible candidates, unappealing elitists backed by terrible campaigns. Trump, on the other hand, is a terrific campaigner, and from the looks of it, his Democrat opponent will be another Romney or Kerry.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) The Joker told Batman, ""This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.""

That line, from the closing minutes of ""The Dark Knight"", is one way to anticipate what will happen on Capitol Hill next week: Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump begin Wednesday.

The unstoppable force? A parade of witnesses testifying that Trump's White House appeared to be shaking down Ukraine's president to force an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing.

The immovable object: Trump and his GOP supporters, who this week tried out an array of defenses, including Sen. Lindsey Graham saying he won't read the witnesses' transcripts and that the process is ""BS.""

""As the President faces an impeachment inquiry, he, like any individual facing a serious allegation, has a right to mount a robust defense,"" noted Elliot Williams. ""However, President Trump's behavior toward those tasked with congressional oversight and investigations into his personal conduct, and his attitude toward the current congressional impeachment inquiry are all rooted in the same idea: that our country's basic systems themselves are illegitimate.""

Trump is relying on ""public mistrust of government"" and showing he doesn't understand the limits on presidential power, Williams wrote.

The problem for Democrats is that Trump's approach may be working, wrote Susan Glasser in the New Yorker.

""The allegations of abuse of power are striking and unprecedented: a President seeking to privatize American foreign policy for his personal political benefit."" But we know how this will end, she suggested. ""For Trump and his defenders, it is a coup, a show trial, a witch hunt. When that is the starting point, there is no place for the facts, no process that can satisfy, no way to split the difference... the President has successfully rendered the investigation irrelevant, at least for his most fervent supporters.""

Fighting to sway the public

The open hearings may shift opinion. So far, polls show a huge partisan divide between an overwhelming majority of Democrats who favor impeachment and an equally solid bloc of Republicans who don't.

Arick Wierson argued that Democrats should drop the ""quid pro quo"" talk when describing Trump's interaction with Ukraine's president: ""Americans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts argued that Democrats should drop the ""quid pro quo"" talk when describing Trump's interaction with Ukraine's president: ""Americans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts described by a Latin term many don't understand or at least would never use ."" Instead, ""rebrand Trump's alleged transgressions with a term that most Americans don't need to Google to understand -- one with teeth. Bribery. Extortion. Payola. Shakedown. Ransom payment. There are plenty of better ways to say it than quid pro quo.""

All week Trump hammered away at the whistleblower , wrote, who called the ""relentless assault"" by the President and his backers ""wrong, irrelevant and dangerous."" Witnesses have backed up all of the whistleblower's key allegations.

Michael D'Antonio suggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. ""If Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Meanwhile the impeachment controversy dragged in Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky before military aid to that nation was released. Trump (and Pence) biographersuggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. ""If Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Pence is the perfect target ,"" he wrote.

OK Boomer, OK Millennial

In the New Zealand parliament, Chlöe Swarbrick's response when an older colleague heckled her during a climate crisis speech was instant: ""OK Boomer."" And it went viral.

So my colleague Pat Wiedenkeller asked two of CNN Opinion's regular commentators to hash it out. Millennial Jill Filipovic wrote to Boomer Paul Callan: ""You Boomers have called us 'snowflakes,' mocked us for trigger warnings and safe spaces (which are just an attempt to be sensitive to others), and even derided avocado toast (which is delicious). You were born into post-war prosperity, enjoyed the riches of government hand-outs and affordable education, then moved into your subsidized suburban homes and pulled the ladder up behind you.""

Callan fired back: ""Your professional success is undoubtedly the result of your Boomer parents raising you in a 'subsidized suburban home,' thereby facilitating the 'affordable education' you now criticize. The participation trophies were a Boomer error I readily admit.""

Leymah Gbowee and José Ramos-Horta wrote, ""Unencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, In a related vein, two former Nobel Peace Prize winners, congratulated young activists for acting on climate issues while adults have largely abdicated.andwrote, ""Unencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, young people have the raw, out-of-the-box thinking that could lead to the development of the 'moonshot' ideas we need to save the planet.""

2020 countdown

Everything in politics may look different less than a year from now, when voters choose a president. Tuesday's off-year election offered some intriguing clues.

Julian Zelizer described key results as "" described key results as "" extraordinarily frightening for Republicans . Like the 2018 House midterms, which were devastating to the GOP, the results in Kentucky and Virginia offer evidence that the president's record is putting their party in real jeopardy. They show that the President's imprint on politics -- more than almost anything else -- has the capacity to drive up Democratic turnout as the party's loyalists, including union members, show they are furious about what has taken place.""

Alice Stewart was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn't Trump's fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn't Trump's fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: ""Suburbs are the new Florida, so focus on suburbia.""

Ron Brownstein, noted that the GOP "" In the Atlantic,, noted that the GOP "" suffered resounding repudiations in urban centers and inner suburbs , which contain many of the nonwhite, young-adult, and white-collar white voters who polls show are most resistant to Trump."" If the trend continues, it's hard to see how the President could again go down the narrow path that brought him victory in 2016.

There's alarm on the Democratic side too as the battle between two of the top tier candidates, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, grew more fiery, particularly after Warren rolled out a Medicare for All plan that wipes out private health insurance.

Bakari Sellers warned: ""If Democrats are serious about defeating Trump, flipping the US Senate, and expanding our lead in the US House, we must understand that warned: ""If Democrats are serious about defeating Trump, flipping the US Senate, and expanding our lead in the US House, we must understand that purity tests -- making sure that a candidate's ideology lines up perfectly with their party's -- do not work .""

Donald Trump, sports fan

President Trump has discovered his inner sports fan, leaving his resorts and the White House in recent weeks for a World Series game, a UFC fight and the LSU-Alabama game. In Alabama, he was cheered. But at the first two events he heard a sound that is never directed at him at his rallies: boos.

Dean Obeidallah: ""Given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, It's what he deserves, wrote: ""Given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, he should brace himself to hear a lot more boos between now and when he finally vacates the White House.""

Politics and sports often don't mix. When the World Champion Washington Nationals visited the White House Monday, some team members didn't show up, including relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, who has objected to Trump's rhetoric. But some were enthusiastic, including catcher Kurt Suzuki who wore a MAGA hat for the occasion.

Paul Begala: ""When liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him...when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids' game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team. It took guts for both players, wrote: ""When liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him...when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids' game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team.

A special day

A century ago, on November 11, 1919, Americans marked the one-year anniversary of the end of World War I with a new holiday.

""Armistice Day"" is now known as Veterans Day and it honors those who have served in the military in war and peace. Among those we should remember Monday, wrote Admiral Mike Gilday, the US Navy's Chief of Naval Operations is Cmdr. Ernest Evans, ""who chose to sail the USS Johnston into harm's way during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Sea in 1944. Despite the superior Japanese force of battleships, heavy cruisers, and destroyers, Johnston's actions ultimately crippled the Imperial Japanese Navy. Evans, who died in action, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.""

The lesson to remember? Gilday wrote, ""Across the nation this Veterans Day, we honor the service, sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who have worn the cloth of this great nation. If you believe as I do that there is a desire in every human heart to live in freedom, then this day is a special day .""

Elizabeth Warren has a message for those attacking her as angry: Yes, she is.

On Friday afternoon, the Massachusetts Democrat, in a fundraising email for her presidential campaign, addressed the innuendo stoked this week by former Vice President Joe Biden and others who have cast her as a elitist ideologue.

""I am angry and I own it,"" the subject line read.

""Over and over,"" Warren wrote below, ""we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.""

It was the most direct response to -- and an embrace of -- an attack launched by Biden in a Medium post on Tuesday in which he assailed the senator, without naming names, over her suggestion that his arguments against ""Medicare for All"" sounded like they were coming from a candidate ""running in the wrong presidential primary.""

In her response, Warren also made explicit what many of her supporters have suggested in recent days: that recent criticisms lodged against her by rivals like Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have a sexist edge to them.

Both have singled out Warren for taking a ""my way or the highway"" approach to her campaign. On Tuesday, Biden wrote that Warren's remarks accusing him of employing ""Republican talking points"" against Medicare for All suggested a more damning analysis.

""These kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,"" the former vice president wrote, before describing Warren's ""approach to politics"" as ""condescending"" and elitist.

The word that jumped off the screen to many Democrats -- and a lot of women: ""angry."" Almost immediately, a series of writers and pundits zeroed in on and denounced the phrasing as sexist -- which, to many observers of her campaign, seemed odd, if not plainly misleading.

""This is not an endorsement of Elizabeth Warren the candidate, but an affirmation of who I know her to be. Anyone falsely casting her as angry & antagonistic is telegraphing the limits of their minds, & the magnitude of their insecurities,"" wrote journalist Connie Schultz , who is the wife of Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

'That has nothing to do with it'

In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Friday, after Warren's email landed, Biden denied that he had characterized his rival for the nomination as angry because of her gender.

""The strong women in my life are angry -- they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,"" he said.

Criticizing her in terms used to denigrate women, Biden added, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""It had nothing to do with that,"" the former vice president said. ""It had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.""

The Biden campaign's view -- and those of his close allies, men and women -- is that Warren threw the first punch, during the health care dust-up, and he is merely answering her remarks.

Warren's initial comment about running in the ""wrong presidential primary"" was ""absurd, because Joe Biden has served this country honorably -- he's been a Democrat his entire life,"" said senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders, baking in an implicit jab at Warren's decision, in 1996, to switch her registration from Republican to Democrat.

""This has been and is about health care, and we want to be able to have a high-level policy conversation,"" Sanders said. ""And as Democrats, we should be able to disagree without asserting that someone doesn't know what they're talking about or should be kicked out of the party or is corrupt.""

The Warren campaign, which has made it a practice from the starting line not to swat at every provocation, opted against putting out a direct reply to Biden's initial criticism. Instead, her team amplified some of the ambient online criticism and appeared poised, at least until Friday afternoon, to leave it at that.

Despite the more forward wording, Warren's email offered a different flavor of the same message she regularly delivers to supporters on the campaign trail. Lines in the email detailing her anger ""on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump's government, our rigged economy, and business as usual,"" were nearly indistinguishable from her stump speech.

Her frustration, Warren has said throughout the campaign, does not hold some distorting grip on her politics.

""I don't propose a wealth tax because I'm cranky,"" she said during a rally in Seattle this summer, a line she often repeats now on the stump, sometimes smiling broadly for effect. ""I don't propose it because I'm mad at anybody.""

This is the narrow line Warren has been made to walk throughout the campaign. Polling over the course of the past 10 months suggests she has successfully charted the path. Warren tops a number of early-state polls and is regularly found to be among the leaders when voters are asked to name their second-choice candidates.

'A smarty britches'

Still, the prospect of a Warren presidency has provoked anxiety and attacks from those opposed to her politics, and, quite literally, brought at least one grown man to the brink of tears.

""I don't need Elizabeth Warren, or the government, giving away my money,"" billionaire former hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman told CNBC earlier this week, his eyes watering, when the conversation turned to Warren's signature wealth tax.

Cooperman is one in a growing crowd of powerful men -- including some campaign rivals -- to paint Warren, who has campaigned on a populist promise to tax the rich in order to fund an ambitious suite of social programs, as angry or vindictive.

Asked this week if he would ever discuss tax policy with Warren, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: ""I'm not sure how open-minded she is ... or that she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.""

Before he bowed out of the race, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas suggested that Warren ""is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other"" than ""lifting people up.""

A source close to Biden's campaign described the new tone of attacks on Warren coming from him and his team as intentional in a different way: to communicate the message that ""Warren is a smarty britches who thinks if you don't agree with her, you're an idiot.""

Faced with accusations, amplified on social media by Warren's campaign during the week, over what some saw as sexist attacks, Biden's campaign also pointed to examples of him using the same words and phrases to criticize men -- including the time he called John McCain an ""angry man"" and ""a little more angry than he usually is"" in 2008, before labeling Mitt Romney an ""elitist"" in 2012.

Carol Moseley Braun, a Biden-supporting former senator from Illinois, said she's known the former vice president since the 1990s and has seen ""nothing, zero, zippo, to suggest this man has got a sexist bone in his body. I just haven't.""

""I don't think it's so much gendered criticism as it is a stupid argument, and you can quote me on that,"" she said. ""It's a silly argument, as far as I'm concerned. The fact is that Sen. Warren is entitled to her position, VP Biden is entitled to his position and they're not going to be the same position -- they're different candidates.""

She also alluded to Biden's implicit digs at Warren for being a registered Republican until the 1990s.

""To have somebody that just came around beating up on (Biden), to me, is just insulting,"" she said.

Biden's campaign also needled the Warren campaign for its response to his comments -- which during the week largely came through retweeting women and progressive activists who were critical.

""Donald Trump has already tried to extort a foreign country into intervening in this election, and we fought back. In his attempts to get reelected, no dirty trick will be off limits and no stone left unturned,"" said spokesman Andrew Bates. ""Anyone who thinks they will be able to simply subtweet their way to victory against Donald Trump is flat-out wrong."""

I think you have to earn votes and not buy them,"" Klobuchar told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" adding to the lukewarm reception given in recent days to the billionaire politician by members of the crowded field of candidates.

The move is the clearest sign to date that the former three-term mayor is seriously considering following through with something he has been weighing for weeks. Bloomberg, whose media empire helped him amass a net worth of $51 billion, is the 8th richest person in America, according to Forbes. (Trump is 275th on that list, with an estimated net worth of $3.1 billion.)

Klobuchar said Sunday that she welcomes the former mayor into the contest, noting that he has done ""incredible work"" on gun safety and environmental issues. But the Minnesota Democrat also told Tapper that she doesn't think Bloomberg can ""just waltz in"" and say, ""I'm good enough to be president"" and that ""the other people aren't good enough."""

“I am angry and I own it,” Warren declared in an email blast on Friday. However, her response was not geared toward her GOP foe, President Trump. Rather, it was a response to the recent remarks, primarily, from Biden.

The back and forth began following the rollout of Warren’s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan. Biden’s campaign immediately shredded what it called the “mathematical gymnastics” used in the proposal. Warren responded to the critique, calling out Biden by name and suggesting that he was using “Republican talking points.”

“Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don’t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,” she told reporters:

Biden responded in a Medium post on Tuesday, defending his record of fighting for the Democrat Party.

“The other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,” he began, addressing Warren without mentioning her name:

But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn’t agree with you — it’s not just that you disagree — that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.

Warren hit back on Friday, subtly attributing his response to sexism.

“Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,” Warren’s email read.

The former vice president denied the implication during an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Friday.

“The strong women in my life are angry — they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,” he explained.

“It had nothing to do with that,” he continued. “It had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.”"

Is his analysis incorrect.”

Klobuchar said, “Yes. Very incorrect. I’m gaining momentum all of the time. We’re doubling offices in Iowa. We got an extraordinary amount of help after the last debate raising $2.1 million at Amyklobuchar.com in just six days, so we’re building an operation that can win. And I have the most endorsements of anyone in Iowa of any of the candidates. Stepping back to this assertion from his spokesperson, I have seen a lot of excitement about all of our candidates.

As of today, Republican enthusiasm sits at 65 percent, compared to 64 percent for Democrats.

You might argue that a single point lead is meaningless. But here’s the rub…

It’s not supposed to be like this.

The party with the incumbent president is almost always running behind in voter enthusiasm. The reasons for this should be obvious: the other side is more juiced to win back the White House.

Back in 2000, when Democrats were coming off two terms of Democrat Bill Clinton, the GOP had a 51 to 39 percent enthusiasm edge — 12 points.

In 2004, when Republican George W. Bush ran for reelection, Democrats had a 73 to 62 percent lead — 11 points.

In 2008, after two Bush terms, Democrats were up 73 to 59 percent — 14 points.

In 2012, as Democrat Barack Obama sought his second term, Republicans were up 70 to 59 — 11 points.

In 2016, after two Obama terms, the GOP was up 51 to 43 — 8 points.

In every case since 2000, the party out of power did not just enjoy a lead in enthusiasm, with the exception of 2016; it enjoyed a double-digit lead. But here we are going into 2020, and the party in power, the GOP, is not only plenty enthusiastic; it is in the lead.

What’s more, we are seeing a big jump since the 2018 midterms, a jump from 51 to 66 for the Republicans and a jump from 48 to 65 percent for Democrats.

So what’s different this time?

A number of things…

Unlike Bush Jr., Trump is determined to hold on to his base. Clinton and Obama governed this way. Bush did not, and the results of that, during his second term (Katrina plus immigration reform), were catastrophic.

Trump has wisely embraced the Clinton/Obama game plan that says you always dance with them that brung ya.

Secondly, of course, is this absurd and outrageous impeachment, which is being exposed every day as a full-blown Deep State-Media-Democrat coup, a straight-up conspiracy, and this is almost certainly creating a rallying effect around Trump.

Finally, the Democrat presidential field is in every way terrible. Former Vice President Joe Biden is too old, represents the past, and not very bright. Elizabeth Warren is a non-starter with her pledge to strip 160 million Americans of their private health insurance as she more than doubles the federal budget with her $52 trillion — with a “T” — Medicare for All fiasco. Bernie Sanders is a 198-year-old commie with a bum ticker.

There is no Barack Obama in this field. There is no Ronald Reagan. There is no Bill Clinton. There is no Donald Trump. There is no superstar who screams This Is the Future — just a bunch of old socialists. Alphas win presidential elections, and there is not an alpha in the bunch.

On paper, and until she opens her mouth, Kamala Harris looks every inch the superstar. But she flamed out as soon as the spotlight revealed her crippling flaws and lack of intelligence.

A word of caution: we don’t know what this poll will look like a year from now. Nevertheless, it is more than noteworthy now, and it is difficult to imagine a scenario, other than a deep recession, that changes these numbers. But with most economic indicators on the upswing, a recession seems less likely than it did three months ago when the media were literally begging for a recession.

In fact, it is much easier to game out scenarios where enthusiasm for Trump actually increases, especially if Democrats jump off that cliff and vote to impeach. This impeachment process is such an outrageous and infuriating abuse of power, so obscenely anti-democratic, and Trump will continue to be effective at communicating that point.

It is also worth pointing out that this enthusiasm poll did not predict the outcome of the 2004 and 2012 elections. Democrats had an 11-point lead in ’04, and Democrat John Kerry still lost to Bush. Republicans also had an 11-point lead in 2012, and Republican Mitt Romney still lost to Obama.

But this might also reveal a couple of things in Trump’s favor: 1) it is difficult to knock out an incumbent president and 2) candidates matter. Kerry and Romney were terrible candidates, unappealing elitists backed by terrible campaigns. Trump, on the other hand, is a terrific campaigner, and from the looks of it, his Democrat opponent will be another Romney or Kerry.

(CNN) The Joker told Batman, ""This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.""

That line, from the closing minutes of ""The Dark Knight"", is one way to anticipate what will happen on Capitol Hill next week: Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump begin Wednesday.

The unstoppable force? A parade of witnesses testifying that Trump's White House appeared to be shaking down Ukraine's president to force an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing.

The immovable object: Trump and his GOP supporters, who this week tried out an array of defenses, including Sen. Lindsey Graham saying he won't read the witnesses' transcripts and that the process is ""BS.""

""As the President faces an impeachment inquiry, he, like any individual facing a serious allegation, has a right to mount a robust defense,"" noted Elliot Williams. ""However, President Trump's behavior toward those tasked with congressional oversight and investigations into his personal conduct, and his attitude toward the current congressional impeachment inquiry are all rooted in the same idea: that our country's basic systems themselves are illegitimate.""

Trump is relying on ""public mistrust of government"" and showing he doesn't understand the limits on presidential power, Williams wrote.

The problem for Democrats is that Trump's approach may be working, wrote Susan Glasser in the New Yorker.

""The allegations of abuse of power are striking and unprecedented: a President seeking to privatize American foreign policy for his personal political benefit."" But we know how this will end, she suggested. ""For Trump and his defenders, it is a coup, a show trial, a witch hunt. When that is the starting point, there is no place for the facts, no process that can satisfy, no way to split the difference... the President has successfully rendered the investigation irrelevant, at least for his most fervent supporters.""

Fighting to sway the public

The open hearings may shift opinion. So far, polls show a huge partisan divide between an overwhelming majority of Democrats who favor impeachment and an equally solid bloc of Republicans who don't.

Arick Wierson argued that Democrats should drop the ""quid pro quo"" talk when describing Trump's interaction with Ukraine's president: ""Americans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts argued that Democrats should drop the ""quid pro quo"" talk when describing Trump's interaction with Ukraine's president: ""Americans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts described by a Latin term many don't understand or at least would never use ."" Instead, ""rebrand Trump's alleged transgressions with a term that most Americans don't need to Google to understand -- one with teeth. Bribery. Extortion. Payola. Shakedown. Ransom payment. There are plenty of better ways to say it than quid pro quo.""

All week Trump hammered away at the whistleblower , wrote, who called the ""relentless assault"" by the President and his backers ""wrong, irrelevant and dangerous."" Witnesses have backed up all of the whistleblower's key allegations.

Michael D'Antonio suggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. ""If Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Meanwhile the impeachment controversy dragged in Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky before military aid to that nation was released. Trump (and Pence) biographersuggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. ""If Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Pence is the perfect target ,"" he wrote.

OK Boomer, OK Millennial

In the New Zealand parliament, Chlöe Swarbrick's response when an older colleague heckled her during a climate crisis speech was instant: ""OK Boomer."" And it went viral.

So my colleague Pat Wiedenkeller asked two of CNN Opinion's regular commentators to hash it out. Millennial Jill Filipovic wrote to Boomer Paul Callan: ""You Boomers have called us 'snowflakes,' mocked us for trigger warnings and safe spaces (which are just an attempt to be sensitive to others), and even derided avocado toast (which is delicious). You were born into post-war prosperity, enjoyed the riches of government hand-outs and affordable education, then moved into your subsidized suburban homes and pulled the ladder up behind you.""

Callan fired back: ""Your professional success is undoubtedly the result of your Boomer parents raising you in a 'subsidized suburban home,' thereby facilitating the 'affordable education' you now criticize. The participation trophies were a Boomer error I readily admit.""

Leymah Gbowee and José Ramos-Horta wrote, ""Unencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, In a related vein, two former Nobel Peace Prize winners, congratulated young activists for acting on climate issues while adults have largely abdicated.andwrote, ""Unencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, young people have the raw, out-of-the-box thinking that could lead to the development of the 'moonshot' ideas we need to save the planet.""

2020 countdown

Everything in politics may look different less than a year from now, when voters choose a president. Tuesday's off-year election offered some intriguing clues.

Julian Zelizer described key results as "" described key results as "" extraordinarily frightening for Republicans . Like the 2018 House midterms, which were devastating to the GOP, the results in Kentucky and Virginia offer evidence that the president's record is putting their party in real jeopardy. They show that the President's imprint on politics -- more than almost anything else -- has the capacity to drive up Democratic turnout as the party's loyalists, including union members, show they are furious about what has taken place.""

Alice Stewart was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn't Trump's fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn't Trump's fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: ""Suburbs are the new Florida, so focus on suburbia.""

Ron Brownstein, noted that the GOP "" In the Atlantic,, noted that the GOP "" suffered resounding repudiations in urban centers and inner suburbs , which contain many of the nonwhite, young-adult, and white-collar white voters who polls show are most resistant to Trump."" If the trend continues, it's hard to see how the President could again go down the narrow path that brought him victory in 2016.

There's alarm on the Democratic side too as the battle between two of the top tier candidates, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, grew more fiery, particularly after Warren rolled out a Medicare for All plan that wipes out private health insurance.

Bakari Sellers warned: ""If Democrats are serious about defeating Trump, flipping the US Senate, and expanding our lead in the US House, we must understand that warned: ""If Democrats are serious about defeating Trump, flipping the US Senate, and expanding our lead in the US House, we must understand that purity tests -- making sure that a candidate's ideology lines up perfectly with their party's -- do not work .""

Donald Trump, sports fan

President Trump has discovered his inner sports fan, leaving his resorts and the White House in recent weeks for a World Series game, a UFC fight and the LSU-Alabama game. In Alabama, he was cheered. But at the first two events he heard a sound that is never directed at him at his rallies: boos.

Dean Obeidallah: ""Given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, It's what he deserves, wrote: ""Given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, he should brace himself to hear a lot more boos between now and when he finally vacates the White House.""

Politics and sports often don't mix. When the World Champion Washington Nationals visited the White House Monday, some team members didn't show up, including relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, who has objected to Trump's rhetoric. But some were enthusiastic, including catcher Kurt Suzuki who wore a MAGA hat for the occasion.

Paul Begala: ""When liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him...when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids' game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team. It took guts for both players, wrote: ""When liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him...when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids' game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team.

A special day

A century ago, on November 11, 1919, Americans marked the one-year anniversary of the end of World War I with a new holiday.

""Armistice Day"" is now known as Veterans Day and it honors those who have served in the military in war and peace. Among those we should remember Monday, wrote Admiral Mike Gilday, the US Navy's Chief of Naval Operations is Cmdr. Ernest Evans, ""who chose to sail the USS Johnston into harm's way during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Sea in 1944. Despite the superior Japanese force of battleships, heavy cruisers, and destroyers, Johnston's actions ultimately crippled the Imperial Japanese Navy. Evans, who died in action, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.""

The lesson to remember? Gilday wrote, ""Across the nation this Veterans Day, we honor the service, sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who have worn the cloth of this great nation. If you believe as I do that there is a desire in every human heart to live in freedom, then this day is a special day .""

The phrase drew some jeers on social media, but Holly Thomas wrote that there's nothing wrong with Watson's mindset and she didn't deserve ""a maelstrom of criticism for her honesty.""

It's not that he couldn't move faster, it's that he clearly didn't want to. Stopping and talking to people, especially young people there to greet him, is the essence of Biden. Aides joke that it often takes him longer than scheduled for him to get to events because he talks to everyone.

That was vividly on display here, where he was taking part in a Granite State rite of passage: filing for the first-in-the-nation primary here in person.

Biden continues to face attacks from Trump and his allies over his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. And the former vice president is engaged in an increasingly ugly back and forth with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over health care policy.

When asked if Trump's relentless attacks are helping, without hesitation, he said yes.

""They're helping me in every way,"" Biden tells us, arguing the basics: Democratic voters see that the President considers him a threat.

Biden also suggested that he doesn't want to fight with Warren but feels he has no choice after she suggested his arguments against her plan to fund ""Medicare for All"" meant he was running in the wrong presidential primary. He responded by calling her approach elitist , writing that they ""reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics."" On Friday, in an email to supporters, Warren embraced the angry label, writing, ""I am angry and I own it,"" and said women have been told ""over and over"" that they are not allowed to be angry.

Biden told us attacking Warren, using a term some see as sexist, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""I was responding to a comment she made,"" Biden said. ""She said that anyone who disagreed with her and took her on, on her issue of Medicare for All, somehow either was a coward, wasn't willing to stand up and state what they thought. Somehow doing something -- I think the phrase was should be in a Republican primary. When we talk about Medicare for All, people talk about taking two years, five years, 10 years to get it done. That doesn't give any real reassurance to people out there,"" he explained.

When asked directly whether somebody who supports Medicare for All, a sweeping liberal proposal that would create a national health care system, can beat Donald Trump, Biden demurred.

""I'm not going to make that judgment,"" he told CNN.

Biden's sharpened attacks on Warren comes as a recent Monmouth University poll shows Warren catching Biden at the top of the field among Democrats nationally. She has also placed in the top tier in the most recent surveys of likely Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, while Biden has fallen behind the pack in some early state polls.

The rough reality for Biden, one his campaign started setting expectations about months ago, is that despite being a front-runner, he's not there alone and he very well could lose Iowa and New Hampshire.

If that happened, would his candidacy survive?

""I think I'm going to do better in both places than that,"" Biden insisted.

Pushed again on what would happen, Biden replied: ""Not going to go there,"" he replied.

On the trail

For Biden, being greeted here in New Hampshire by throngs of people holding campaign signs and beating drums (props born out of one of Biden's greatest hits lines -- that he will beat Trump ""like a drum"") was a chance to show passion behind a candidacy that leans hard into the practical.

""Eight years of Donald Trump will forever and fundamentally change the character of this country, and that's why I am running,"" Biden declared at a rally outside on a blustery cold day.

Other candidates, especially his fellow leading contenders like Warren and Bernie Sanders, are selling a wholesale change in approach to governance. Biden is not. He is all about getting Trump out of the White House and says he's the best to do it.

Still, in an interview inside the State House gift shop, he insisted that his candidacy is about more than a pragmatic promise to beat Trump.

""You feel passion for your campaign?"" we asked.

""I do, sure I do. Or I wouldn't be, look, the only reason I'm doing this is because we cannot, we cannot continue down the road of dividing this nation and walking away from the rest of the world,"" he replied, ticking off reasons he said the President has hurt America globally.

It's an understandable approach. Talking to voters who came to see him, many said flatly that the main reason they're considering supporting Biden is because he has the best chance of defeating the President, which anecdotally here, just as in polls of Democratic voters, matters more than anything to them in 2020.

On the stump, Biden's campaign clearly tries to weave in reminders of his experience, with opportunities to show how he has grown.

At a roundtable to discuss the Violence Against Women Act, which he helped write in the Senate, Biden goes deep into the history of how hard it was to convince his male colleagues to make changes that are taken for granted in 2019, like making it illegal for a man to rape his wife.

To show he has a grasp on modern day issues, he reminded the audience that men -- especially trans men -- are frequent victims of violence.

Events like this also allow for Biden to do what Biden does best: emote and empathize. After the event was over and the microphones turned off, he stayed in his seat talking intensely to a woman who told her own story of being a victim of violence.

Later, at a town hall in Franklin, New Hampshire, two of the questioners were children. One about climate change, and another about gun violence.

""How are you going to make schools more safe from mass shootings?"" asked a 10-year-old boy who said his name was Jordan.

""Think about this. Those of you over 30. Could you ever imagine having asked that question?"" responded with a question of his own from the audience.

""You talk about the soul of America. It's a sick soul we have when in fact we send our kids into school these days that duck and cover."" he added.

Third time a charm?

The first time Biden ran for president was 1987. The world has changed a lot since then, and -- riding with him to an event -- he insists he has changed with it. This is Biden's third time running for president, which he admitted is tricky.

""The good news is the bad news. Everybody knows me. Everybody has an opinion. So it's harder to mislabel me or to say something about me that's not true. I have weaknesses. It's easier to talk about the weaknesses, but the generic point is that people know who I am,"" he said.

Familiarity and comfort drew voters we talked to see him, even though some said they're are not sold yet.

Ruth Kovacs and Terri Arangio were at the State House to see Biden wearing his campaign stickers and holding his signs.

But they told us they're still actively candidate shopping.

""Not 100%"" Kovacs said about her support for Biden. ""Personally, I like the middle of the roaders, not far left. I like Amy [Klobuchar], Pete Buttigieg and of course Joe Biden.""

""I've always loved Joe Biden,"" added Arangio.

""He's a likable guy, he says what it is, sometimes he has his gaffes, but I think that's what makes Joe Joe.""

We met several voters who said they came to see Biden in person, a privilege that Granite State voters hold dear, in order to see for themselves if the 76-year-old former vice president seems too old to be president.

Eric Swendsen came to the Franklin town hall with concerns about Biden's age, but told us he felt better after seeing him in action.

""I think he'll be fine. I think he'll be just fine,"" Swendsen said in his post-town hall assessment.

It is a topic we discussed with Biden during our car ride -- that anecdotally older voters who are his age tell us they can't imagine having the stamina to be president.

""What I tell them is, 'Watch me.' Oh God. The one thing that I've learned is, hopefully that age comes with experience, with experience comes with adjustment, and with adjustment comes some wisdom."""

Steyer also promised immediate action to combat the climate crisis , promising to invoke ""emergency powers"" on the first day of his presidency as a means of tackling the issue.

But the longtime Democratic donor and impeachment advocate also cast himself as a moderate in opposition to the progressive frontrunners, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , with his support for a public health insurance option, suggesting it would be less disruptive to implement than the sweeping ""Medicare for All"" plan the two progressive senators support.

Here are four takeaways from Steyer's town hall:

Steyer puts Bloomberg on the spot

Steyer took early aim at Bloomberg, saying the former New York City mayor should either get on board with a wealth tax or think twice about pursuing the Democratic nomination.

""Unless Mr. Bloomberg is willing to accept a wealth tax, I don't believe he can be an appropriate nominee for the Democratic Party,"" Steyer, who supports the policy, said early on in the evening.

He also pledged to ""undo"" all of the tax cuts given to the wealthiest Americans and corporations over the past four decades.

""The distribution of wealth across society is an absolute scandal,"" he said.

Bloomberg on Friday filed to run in Alabama's Democratic presidential primary in 2020, in the clearest sign to date that the former mayor is seriously considering following through with something he has been weighing for weeks.

Steyer: Judge me by how I handled scandals

In South Carolina , a Steyer adviser resigned after being outed for accessing volunteer data compiled by Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign.

In Iowa , a Steyer adviser resigned after being accused of offering money in exchange for endorsements.

But on Sunday night, Steyer argued that his reaction to those scandals -- and not critics' suggestion of a culture of impropriety -- is what voters should focus on.

""Unauthorized things happen (in campaigns) and the question is what you're going to do about them,"" he said. ""In both those cases, we did exactly what I think is appropriate. We went in, we figured out what happened, we took action.""

By immediately acting to secure resignations from the individuals accused, Steyer said, his campaign was actually demonstrating a unique strength.

""That's exactly what you look for in an organization -- that you have rules that are enforced by the organization when something that is not proper occurs,"" Steyer said.

""You deal with it with the highest possible integrity, you actually walk the walk of doing the right thing, and then you move on.""

Steyer breaks with progressive leaders on health care

""Medicare for All"" is not for Tom Steyer.

The billionaire businessman said he would prefer to build on the current system, as it exists under the Affordable Care Act, and push for a public option, or a government-backed insurance plan.

The issue, he argued, was one of choice.

""I happen to be one of the people who believes in a public option, giving people the option basically of joining Medicare, but allowing 160 million people to make the decision for themselves,"" Steyer said.

Steyer also pointed to organized labor, and union members who have negotiated for their insurance, as a reason he would shy away from a more radical shift.

""I don't think it's right for the government to tell them that we're going to scrap a 75-year-old system. If you like it, keep doing it,"" he said. ""If the public option is cheaper and better for you, then you can go to your employer and say pay me the money you're spending on my health care, I'll buy the public option.""

Climate change comes first in a Steyer White House

How is Tom Steyer different from his primary rivals when it comes to climate change?

The answer, he said, is simple: It is his ""number one priority"" -- taking precedent over any and all other issues.

Steyer on Sunday said he would declare a state of emergency on climate on his first day in office and use the emergency powers of the presidency ""to make changes immediately.""

He also pledged to demand Congress to pass a version of the Green New Deal during his first 100 days in office.

""I've spent over a decade fighting oil companies and beating them at the ballot box. I've led the charge for clean energy across the country at the ballot box,"" Steyer said. ""I've worked to stop pipelines. I've worked to stop fossil fuel plants. We're talking about the future, but you can look at my history and know that this is something that is an absolutely top priority for me.""

Steyer added he does not fly private, and said he hopes the rest of the Democratic field would promise to forswear it too."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is being disingenuous, suggesting she is likely promoting her sweeping wealth tax proposals to divert attention from her own net worth, which is well into the millions.

Warren has made millionaires and billionaires a central target of her campaign, proposing an “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a two percent tax on individuals with $50 million in assets or more. The percentage increases to three percent for those with $1 billion or more. Warren also says she will pay for her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan, in part, by “asking billionaires to pitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion.”

She recently unveiled her sarcastic “calculator for the billionaires,” which she used to hit Michael Bloomberg directly:

Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you're looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here: https://t.co/6UMSAf90NT — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 7, 2019

However, Cuban believes Warren is incessantly targeting the ultra-wealthy to distract the general public from her own wealth. She and her husband have a net worth of over $12 million, according to Forbes.

“The reality for @ewarren is that this is as much to divert attention from her income and net worth as anything else,” he wrote over the weekend. “Other than steyer she is the wealthiest of all the Dem Candidates. By far”:

He continued, noting that Warren actually qualifies as a “one-percenter” herself.

“According to her filings she made 900k last year which means her family earns more than 2x the amount needed to be a 1 percenter,” Cuban stated. “She paid 25.5% of that in taxes which is less than the % I paid in taxes (29.85%).”

“Forbes says her networth is north of $12m,” he continued. “That’s being rich. Filthy rich. I’m sure it’s richer than she ever imagined she would be.”

“Good for her. She earned it. It puts her millions above the threshold for being part of the richest 1 percent by networth in our country,” he added:

While he appeared to approve of the intentions behind Warren’s proposals, many of which would be funded my hiking taxes on the wealthy, Cuban says she has “several fundamental issues in her plans.”

“First she needs quite a few things to pass Congress in order for any of it to work. Is it realistic to think any of it will pass let alone all of it?” he asked:

Is it realistic to think any of it will pass let alone all of it ? pic.twitter.com/vH24bPgE9q — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) November 9, 2019

Cuban said the presidential hopeful is “probably is the smartest of all the candidates,” which means “intellectually she knows she is misleading the public,” particularly when it comes to her Medicare for All proposal:

Let's be real. @ewarren probably is the smartest of all the candidates. Intellectually she knows she is misleading the public . That the chances of getting all the necessary line items she needs for M4All approved within 4 years are nearly impossible — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) November 9, 2019

“I’m fine with paying more taxes. I’ve said it for years on http://blogmaverick.com,” Cuban said.

“But the Senator is like every other candidate. She is selling shiny objects to divert attention from reality,” he added, taking a dig at President Trump:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Monday unveiled his $62 billion plan to revamp the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), promising to end the exclusion on what the presidential hopeful describes as “medically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries” and emphasizing the need to provide “abortion care.”

The former chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee unveiled his VA plan on Veterans Day, proposing $62 billion in new funding to revamp the VA.

“Today, due to serious underfunding, the VA’s infrastructure is crumbling and in vital need of repair. VA hospitals have gone without needed updates and maintenance, and outpatient clinics and Vet Centers have gone unopened,” Sanders’ plan states.

“As President, Bernie will invest at least $62 billion in the infrastructure needed to provide the cutting-edge health care services our veterans have earned and deserve,” it continues.

A good portion of Sanders’ plan is devoted to guaranteeing quality health care for veterans, which he believes Medicare for All will enhance.

“Coupled with Medicare for All, veterans will be able to rely on a health care system that is working for them, not against them; a system focused on a person’s health, not their ability to pay,” his plan states.

Part of that quality medical care, Sanders assesses, should include the ability to undergo taxpayer-funded “medically necessary gender affirmation surgeries” and receive what he calls “abortion care.”

As president, Sanders would “end the VA’s blanket exclusion on medically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries” and “ensure that women veterans will no longer be forced outside the VA system for basic women’s health services, including fertility treatment, abortion care, or specialized cancer treatment and prevention services.”

Sanders is not the only presidential candidate to focus on taxpayer-funded “transition-related” surgeries as part of his VA plan.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) promised “gender-affirming and culturally-competent” health care for LGBT service members and veterans as part of her comprehensive veterans plan released last week.

“A Warren VA will ensure that every LGBTQ+ person can get the equitable, gender-affirming, and culturally-competent health care they need,” Warren’s plan states.

“That means providing all medically necessary care related to the health of transgender people, including transition-related surgery, and allowing providers discretion to deem gender-affirming procedures as medically necessary based on an individualized assessment,” it continues, noting that such surgeries will be available under her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan as well.

“This care will also be available under Medicare for All. Professional medical associations recognize the need for transition-related surgery,” her plan states.

“VA’s blanket exclusion policy of medically necessary treatment is not grounded in medicine; it should be repealed,” it adds."

“Although Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it’s far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs,” Malloy added.

Quinnipiac also asked 636 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters if they would support Michael Bloomberg. Only two percent signaled they would “definitely” support him, while 37 percent said they “would consider voting for him.” The majority, 54 percent, said they “definitely would not vote for him.” The margin of error for that question is +/- 5 percent.

“If he truly is in, there is a lot of work to do. But with vast resources to draw from, Michael Bloomberg’s nascent campaign could morph from ‘under construction’ to ‘full steam ahead’ in a New York minute,” Malloy said."

She added, “I certainly welcome Mayor Bloomberg to the race. He’s done incredible work on gun safety, on environmental issues. And it is work of merit. But I don’t think you just waltz in and say instead of well I’m good enough to be president. Your argument is the other people aren’t good enough. That is not how we’ve been conducting the debates. We’re having legitimate debates about who is the strongest person. I think I am the strongest person being from the heartland, the place that we need to win — being the one that has won every red and purple congressional district over and over again and someone who can govern from strength and gotten through the gridlock of Washington.

“I’m looking forward to debating Mayor Bloomberg about that and not if he comes in to say the rest of the field is not good enough,” she added.

If you want to run for president, it is a 50 state process that requires filing papers and whatever else is required to get on the ballot. Alabama’s filing deadline passed last week. New Hampshire and Arkansas expire this week. The heavy hitters of Illinois, California, and Texas are just weeks away. Ohio and North Carolina arrive before Christmas.

In other words, unless someone gets off the pot, the current 2020 crop of tired, old extremists is locked in forever. Which means one of them will face Trump in 2020, and a quick look around shows that Democrats are not happy about that.

There are rumblings about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg seriously considering taking the plunge. There’s even talk about former Attorney General Eric Holder. And because she’s a vampire who keeps coming back in terrible sequels, there’s Hillary.

No one knows what’s going to happen, but it was not supposed to be like this…

For the last four years, Trump has been smeared by the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) as a crazed rapist, racist, and traitor owned by the Russians who must be impeached… Gee, 2020 should be a lay-up for Democrats; after all, we have all those Fox News polls proving Trump is down something like 99 points to every Democrat politician in America, including Ted Kennedy’s corpse.

Why so nervous, Democrats?

Why so nervous, media?

Why this search for a last-minute ringer when the walls are closing in on Drumpf fer realsies this time?

Well, if there’s one thing Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) remember, it’s how meaningless those polls were in 2020… And what I mean by “remember” is “still haven’t come to terms with or accepted.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is the great slight hope, has the best chance against Trump, and he’s not only a walking-talking example of the physical and mental deterioration that awaits those of us lucky enough to live so long, no matter how much the media scream HOAX on his behalf, this Ukraine-China-Hunter thing is a real problem.

Biden was a terrible candidate before he started operating just a notch above “zombie.” Today he’s not just a mess, his son Hunter’s appallingly mercenary, greedy, and unethical business practices, his shameless looting of two countries while his sitting-vice president father led American policy there, is something the Trump campaign is already exploiting.

Remember how Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election team looked at the lay of the Republican presidential field and correctly guessed Mitt Romney would come out on top? It was a gamble, but with an unlimited pile of money, it really wasn’t, and that unlimited pile of money allowed Team Obama to define Romney as a corporate raider even before he secured the nomination.

It was a brilliant play on Obama’s part, and it worked, and now Team Trump is doing the same to Biden. The far-left Politico reports the Trump campaign has spent $287,000 just in Iowa on ads that blast Biden over Ukraine, and this pales compared to the money spent on ads targeting Biden on Facebook and YouTube.

Biden is already getting roughed up and defined by Trump, his numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are cratering, and while he’s still in the lead nationally, he’s nowhere near the safe zone of 35 percent. Regardless, Iowa and New Hampshire matter. If you lose there, your national lead evaporates mighty quick.

And if Biden loses the nomination, that leaves the socialists Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg, the 11-year-old mayor black people can’t stand.

Help us, Michael Bloomberg, you’re our only hope…

The New York Post’s Michael Goodwin is a smart political observer immune to the conventional wisdom that is always wrong, and he thinks Bloomberg is a good bet for Democrats. He makes some good points, but Bloomberg’s biggest problem — by far — is that he has no natural constituency. For all his own problems, Biden has the working class and blacks. Warren and Sanders have the far-far-left. Buttigieg is making a serious play for the same kind of young people who fell in love with Obama.

Who does Bloomberg have? He’s a billionaire businessman, a pushing 80 technocrat… He might be seen as a “moderate” in the Democrat Party, a centrist, but that is where he stands politically, which has zero to do with winning votes. Amy Klobuchar is a centrist — she’s polling at 1 percent. John Hickenlooper is a centrist governor from the swing state of Colorado, he’s already been forced to drop out. The term “centrist” is meaningless without a constituency.

Sure, never bet against a guy who can write a check for $52 billion, but already Bloomberg has said he would not even try to win Iowa and New Hampshire, which I guess is a strategy — a BAD Strategy. We have decades of data proving Iowa and New Hampshire matter. You either get shot out of one of those cannons or you are doomed.

Ask Rudy Giuliani about this strategy. One of the most beloved politicians in 2008 doomed himself under the belief he could ignore Iowa and New Hampshire as he sat on his national and Florida lead and waited for the campaign to come to him. But by the time it did, he had collapsed in the polls.

Yes, Democrats have every reason to be nervous, and after Republicans turn these impeachment hearings into The Joe and Hunter Biden Looted Ukraine and China Show, they will have even more reason.

Savage also takes a trip down memory lane, reflecting on how being the victim of affirmative action helped spawn his meteoric media career and spoke of how the intersection of art and spirituality shaped the man he is today.

Savage Warns Trump on Impeachment: Senate Republicans Cannot Be Trusted

Not only is the Trump presidency at a critical juncture, but so is the United States. The House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), is set to go public with testimonies from key witnesses from the administration this week. While House Republicans, and for the most part, their colleagues in the Senate, have stood united against efforts to impeach President Trump, Savage cautions the upper chamber’s GOP members could ultimately join their Democrat counterparts in voting to remove the president.

“They’ll go whichever way the wind blows,” Savage predicts, pointing to how Republican Senators have repeatedly broken their promises to voters, referencing their decades-old failure to secure the porous Southern border.

“They’re quislings and are liable to go against [Trump] if push comes to shove. I don’t trust them as far as I can throw them and an elephant is their symbol. They never liked him, they never wanted an outsider in the presidency. They wanted someone who was amongst their club,” he adds. “The club machine on both sides decides who will become president. Along came this outsider, this gruff, vulgar businessman, and they hate him and still do. I don’t trust many of them, if any of them.”

2020 Democrats Don’t Stand a Chance vs. President Trump

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) $52 trillion “Medicare for All” proposal to now-defeated “Beto” O’Rourke’s vow to forcibly confiscate an estimated 16 million AR-15s, the Democratic White House primary field is arguably the most far-left in U.S. history. The party’s leftward lurch, coupled with former Vice President Joe Biden’s slipshod campaign performance, may prompt billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to jump into the race. Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is even being floated as a potential contender. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination, Savage’s chips are on the incumbent.

“Warren is unelectable,” Savage says bluntly at the mention of her. “This college Communist is unelectable.”

“She is the most despicable of all of the candidates, next to Bernie Sanders, because her policies are as Marxist as his and in a package just as distasteful as his. He is a crumpled old seltzer man from New York, who you wouldn’t trust your child around,” he quips. “There is a meanness to her face that’s not missed on the electorate, particularly with women. Women know women, better than men know women, and women distrust Elizabeth Warren because they know the type.”

Savage then argues the Democrat field’s pessimistic economic message is wildly out of touch with the reailites of today’s booming job market. Under President Trump, the economy has added 5.1 million jobs, while unemployment has dropped to the lowest rate in nearly half a century.

“They are lecturing us on jobs when Donald Trump is the greatest job creator in the history of America,” Savage states. “How can they run on jobs when we have almost full employment right now? They’re running on a campaign slogan from a time of recession. They’re still stuck in the 1930s. They’re not selling pencils at Grand Central Station right now or selling apples in the street. Everyone who wants to work is working and everyone else is a damn bum.”

Borders, Language, and Culture: A Clairvoyant Credo

Savage has built a large and loyal audience based on many things: His farsighted, politically independent analysis and predictions; captivating storytelling; a no-nonsense, straight-talking demeanor; his dark humor; and his ability to weave culture and religion into any subject at any time. Yet, not even Savage, author of over 40 books, five of which are New York Times bestsellers, would argue that he is most famous for being the originator of the political philosophy: “Borders, Language and Culture.”

Simply, without this trio of ingredients, it is impossible for a country to exist, let alone survive.

“I created the Paul Revere society when I began in radio in 1994,” Savage says. “The organizational theme of it was Borders, Language, Culture — the defining elements of a nation. How did I come up with that? Common sense. There’s not a nation on earth that’s not defined, or was not defined until recently — when the globalists like Angela Merkel, who destroyed Germany and others destroyed nations by making their borders disappear.”

He continues: “Without a common language, you have a Tower of Babel and the nation falls apart because there’s no cohesion. Do you understand the globalists purposely wanted to create Towers of Babel in every western nation in order to weaken and destroy them? What does culture mean? The U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, ring a bell? Do you realize most immigrants don’t know what the Declaration of Independence was or who wrote it? They could care less about the Constitution. All they know is they have rights. The minute they arrive here illegally, doesn’t matter how, they already have a card in their hand and that is ‘I have rights, go to hell.’ They say that to ICE, they say it to the police. They have it all written out by the vermin in the ACLU.”

“You go to any Caribbean nation that’s independent, do you know they all have voter-ID? Grenada, you name it. They say, ‘of course we have voter-ID, how else would we have knowledge of who are voting in our elections? This means anyone can come in and vote. Why don’t you have it?’ Ask Nancy Pelosi. Ask Chuck Schumer, Ask Dianne Feinstein, the devils of our time,” he adds.

Savage then turns his attention to Schiff, who he says would never have been allowed to conduct secret depositions if American lawmakers governed the country upholding the tenets of B.L.C.

“They want the nation to be broken over their knees so they can play with it like nutty-putty like Adam Schiff is doing with our Constitution,” he states. “Do you think a guy like this could get away with secret star-chamber hearings if most American people spoke the same language and understood the Constitution and Bill of Rights? He could never get away with it. A low-life scumbag could never be where he is in a nation where people understand the founding documents and the language of the land.”

Savage — who holds master’s degrees in anthropology and ethnobotany from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a Ph.D in nutritional ethnomedicine from University of California, Berkeley — then draws on his extensive background of as trained biologist to explain B.C.L. in scientific terms.

“The essence of every living thing is the cell, where it be a plant cell or an animal cell. What is it that holds a cell together? In an animal cell, it’s the cell membrane. The cell membrane is the border of the cell. If you make the cell membrane porous, where things can come in and go out, the cell falls apart. It dissolves because it has no identity. It becomes a massive protoplasm,” he explains. “That’s what’s happening as a result of left-wing fanatics, who have put acid on our cell membranes, or our plant cell walls. Without borders, there are no national boundaries, without a common language, there’s no common cohesion, we have a Tower of Babel, and without a common culture, we have no unity among the people. That makes it easier for the devils that are trying to create this new world order to destroy a nation by controlling it from afar.”

Trump-China Trade Battle: Deal or No Deal?

One of the many ways President Trump has changed Washington, DC, is that he has awoken Democrats and Republicans to the gargantuan threat China poses not only to the U.S., but to the West and beyond. Beijing’s sins are capacious, ranging from mass spying, intellectual property threat, currency manipulation, and failure to uphold agreements with trading partners. The Communist country’s reported imprisonment of roughly one-million Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province. along with its draconian censorship and social credit rating system, are horrifying in their own way. Unsurprisingly, Savage has raised the alarm regarding the Red Dragon, and despite President Trump’s historic efforts to reverse Beijing’s unfair trade policies, he does not share the president’s optimism that a deal with the world’s second-largest economy is reachable.

“It’s a smokescreen,” Savage says of the president’s ongoing negotiations with China. “The business interests in America are so powerful. They all oppose tariffs because they’ve gotten used to doing business with China and they don’t care about the longterm, holistic effects. They don’t care about trade imbalances, they don’t care about the military, all the care about is the bottom line.”

“I believe the Better Business Bureau of America as represented by Mitch McConnell and company are totally opposed to tariffs and no matter what deal Trump announces, at the end of the day, there will be no deal. It will be the same deal that’ll screw the American people for all of these decades. I’m not optimistic at all,” he goes on.

He then points to North Korea’s recent missile tests as an another example of how President Trump’s efforts to reach agreements with adversaries have yet to come to fruition, raising the prospect that the Swamp could quietly torpedo such deals.

“I think it’s going to be another smokescreen like the peace deal with North Korea. We kept hearing about how wonderful negotiations with North Korea are and how we outsmarted Kim-Jong-Mentally-Il-Un. As far as I can tell, he’s still firing off missiles with impunity,” says Savage. “I don’t think that the North Korean deal, whatever that may be, is a deal at all. He’s doing exactly what he wants. Iran is re-running the centrifuges. Where is the deal there? We keep hearing about these great deals, but unfortunately, maybe they are great deals and then the Senate goes behind the president’s back and undermines him and our national security.”

King of San Francisco for a Day

The decline of San Francisco, or San Fran-sicko, as Savage affectionally calls his adopted city, has long been well documented. In 1974, he moved to the city by the bay with his wife and two young children due to its then-sterling public school system. Under the leadership of Mayor Willie Brown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and Gov. Jerry Brown, the Democrat-controlled city and the state of California as a whole have increasingly worsened. If “Uncle Mike,” as he is known to long-time listers, could issue any decrees of his choice for 24 hours as mayor, what issues would he tackle to stop the decay?

The foundational issues: Education, healthcare and illegal immigration, of course.

“A struggling family who was working could see there children going through school to the highest level at a very low cost,” Savage says of the San Francisco public schools when he first moved to the city. “California had the best schools in the country, now they’re the worst. What happened? The mass flood of illegal aliens, who became the darlings of the education establishment. So much money was going to bilingual education, but that’s not where it ended. In Nancy Pelosi’s backyard, San Francisco, the ballots are put out in at least eight languages so they can net in every illegal alien to vote in the city for these corrupt Democrat machine politicians. That’s number one, number two, and number ten,” he says in reference to the issues he would fix.

“Illegal aliens have destroyed the state and the city. People go, ‘oh they come here to work.’ Bullsh*t, they come here to work. If you look at the rate of abuse of the welfare system, and the hospitals are overwhelmed. I speak to doctors, I speak to nurses. The healthcare system has been destroyed in this state,” he exclaims.

“I live near the San Fransico Bay and I watch birds every day. Before my show, I feed them bread. A couple of days before, I see a variety of species: seagulls, cormorant, pelicans. It’s beautiful to see them all sitting out there. They don’t kill each other, they don’t fight with each other over fish in the bay. They all get along. Is that really true in a sanctuary city, where we all get along? I don’t think so,” he adds. “When you take a group and displace them with another group, where did the group that was displaced go? What do they feel like? How did it happen so rapidly? And why did it happen so rapidly? Who was behind the invasion of California in America?”

Conservationists and Animal Welfare Advocates: Key Part of Trump’s Base?

While President Trump has denounced trophy hunting as a “horror show,” the Department of Interior has made the importation endangered animals as trophies easier. In October, a bipartisan group of Congress members introduced the Prohibiting Threatened and Endangered Creature Trophies Act of 2019 (ProTECT) Act to prevent the hunting of any endangered or threatened species. Savage, a noted dogfather of a poodle named “Teddy,” says the Trump administration should be protecting animals or risk turning off millions of educated suburban women across the country.

“It’s a very important issue. It’s not only important to me,” Savage says. “I believe this, and people may not know this, is they say President Trump’s support among educated suburbanite women has languished a bit. I’m telling you as I stand here, that’s because of environmental and animal policies that are contrary to educated people, whether they be women, suburbanites, or otherwise. I’ve tried to get this message across to both the president and to others in the administration. And guess what? In-person, they agree with me. But, apparently, the powers that be in the Department of Interior are so powerful that even they don’t have any control over it.”

“They know they’re vulnerable on these issues,” he adds. “Whoever is doing the internal polling is absolutely blind to environmental and animal welfare issues. They are living in the 1940s, a ‘go out and kill an elephant and put his head on a wall’ mentality. It’s 2019, we’re not living in 1918. Most educated people know you can’t slaughter everything on the planet and pave over all the wilderness and call it American greatness.”

The Importance of Art in a Savage Life

Andrew Breitbart’s main thesis was politics is downstream from culture. There is no better proof of his vindication than Barack Obama, the Democratic Party’s first “celebrity” president. Hollywood is unmatched in its ability to shape American life, and though Savage frequently rails against popular culture, he understands the power of art. In a world chalked of cold truths, he uses paintings and classical music to bring color to his life and work.

“Woah, nobody’s ever asked me that before,” Savage replies when asked about how art has shaped him. “I grew up as a little boy in my father’s little antique store in Manhattan. He used to sell bronze statues. He taught me at a very early age the difference between a fine sculpture and a bad one. He would say, ‘look at the toes and fingers. Many artists could sculpt a figure very well, but the real test is how to sculpt the toes and the fingers.’ You start with the little details and you work your way back from there.”

“Classic figures are what I like. I’m not a huge fan of modern art, but I understand it. I’ve looked at Picasso’s split images of women’s faces. However, I’m a classicist in terms of what I prefer in my own house.”

“I love jazz music, as you well know,” he continues, listing off a series of jazz legends such as Art Blakey, Charlie Parker, and Kenny Burrell. “I love classic rock and roll. I’m moved to tears when I listen to classic music. I lose the ability to speak. If I listen to Beethoven, I can’t speak because every few centuries someone comes along that’s so outside the human experience in the greatness that they overwhelm the senses in terms of their genius. The beauty of nature, the artistry of God’s hand in nature, is expressed in man’s attempt to create beauty in his paintings and sculptings.”

The purpose of art, Savage says, is “to create what God created on earth through man’s hands or with his voice.”

The Reinvention of Savage as a Radio Star

Change is hard no matter someone’s age. But that didn’t deter Savage from transforming himself from health supplement expert to a conservative talker at the age of 50. How did he rise to the top of conservative media, and what propelled him there?

“Because of affirmative action, which is aimed at white, heterosexual males, my birthright as an immigrant’s son was stolen from me,” Savage explains. “I’m one of the few people in the media whose father was an immigrant to America. I’m very proud of that fact. He came here from Russia at seven years old. I’ve been working since I was a young kid, and I don’t want to stop working now. If God wants me to stop, he’ll let me know pretty quickly.”

“I went into radio because I was so infuriated by what was done to me, how I had my birthright stolen right from me from the left-wing through affirmative action. They denied me what I was qualified for. All I wanted to be was a college professor. We’re in a war and we’re losing the culture war. The march to the institutions has been won a long time ago.”

“I took a chance. I cut a demo tape in Sausalito, California. I had my wife call in as a caller, I had two friends call in. It was a lot of fun. I had no idea what might happen. Four stations said, ‘you’re really good, we’d like to hire you.’ One was in Boston and another in San Francisco,” he reminisces. “It was KGO at the time, and they put me on at night. What was I getting at? I was getting even. I reached more people in a single show then I would have reached teaching for an entire year in a university. It’s my way of saying, ‘go to hell.’

“I’m as motivated today as the day I began. I have the same passion for the subjects that I have.”

Savage Reflects on Life as a Conservative in San Francisco Speech

On October 29th, Savage delivered a rare speech at the University Club of San Francisco, where he mused for roughly an hour about everything from politics to culture; fashion, jokes, and personal anecdotes about President Trump and were sprinkled through his remarks before an engaged and lively audience. There isn’t much Savage hasn’t accomplished in his career: top-rated show, loyal fanbase, best-selling author, and political influencer.

However, as he’s acknowledged to his listeners, radio lacks instant feedback from listeners. Sometimes everybody needs a human connection.

“Radio is an anonymous medium. I work alone out of my home. You begin to miss human contact,” Savage responds when asked why he wanted to hold the event. “I’m a member of this University Club and I rarely go there. I was approached by their president, who seems to be politically conservative. He’s an anomaly. He asked if I’d be willing to speak at the club, so we can get some like-minded people, and I said sure. It started out with 15-20 people, but of course, I don’t do many live performances, and it sold out rapidly,” he says. “I decided to put the video up of the event at SavageNationLive.com because there were thousands of people who would have liked to be there.

“It started as a desire to meet like-minded people in this club. I was told a lot of young people there are conservative, which is an interesting phenomenon going in San Franciso and around the country. You wouldn’t know it from the media, but that’s what’s going on. Would I do it again? I doubt it,” Savage says.

“I entitled the event as ‘Life as a Conservative in San Francisco.’ I gave the people one hour of entertainment. None of it was heavy politics. I thought, what would Mark Twain do if he were here? I tried to write the humor as if it were him. You can be politically conservative and also be very humorous. It seems that the left owns the entertainment business, but they really don’t. They just exclude people,” he adds.

The Savage Truth

Although Savage has spent the last 25 years fighting for America every day on the airwaves, the radio host has his doubts about whether the country can continue on the path it’s on.

“No, I’m pessimistic,” Savage says bluntly. “I think Donald Trump, even if he wins a second term, it is the last gasp of America as we know it. I think we’re going to enter years and years, if not decades of darkness.”

“I see the mass of illegal immigrants, who are illiterate even in their own language. They have none of our shared values. They will never be Americans and embrace the values that built this country. They’ve been steeped in hatred for this nation by the media and the universities. And they have a very dim view of our nation, even though they love the benefits that have accrued from far better people than them,” he concludes."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday, pointing to her advocacy for ""Medicare for All"" and saying it comes from an elitist belief that Americans shouldn't be allowed to make up their own minds on health care.

The former vice president's comments came at a CNN town hall in Iowa. During the town hall, Biden also discussed how he has connected with Americans on the campaign trail about grief. Additionally, he said he isn't worried about potential political blowback from House Democrats' impeachment proceedings.

He offered a contradictory view on Republicans, insisting they'll be more willing to work with Democrats after President Donald Trump leaves office -- while telling a story about them refusing to cooperate before Trump had even become the GOP presidential nominee.

Here are four takeaways from Biden's town hall:

Attacking Warren

Biden continued to characterize Warren as ""angry"" and ""elitist,"" saying her health care plan is driven by a belief that ""people can't make up their own mind.""

The former vice president also said he's merely been responding after ""she attacked me.""

He was referring to Warren jabbing at him for his opposition to Medicare for All, suggesting without naming the former vice president that he is running in the wrong party's presidential primary. Biden has escalated his criticism of Warren over that comment in recent days. In a Medium post published last week, he wrote that Warren, without naming her, was ""condescending"" and ""representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share.""

Biden said his criticism wasn't about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs.

This time mimicking Medicare for All proponents, Biden said Monday that what he's been calling elitist was ""the attitude that we know better than ordinary people what's in their interests. 'I know more than you, let me tell you what to do.'""

""The attitude is elitist that people can't make up their own mind,"" Biden said.

""You like your health insurance,"" he said, then dropped to a lower voice: ""'But you shouldn't like your health insurance, you should have to give that up. I'm going to demand you not have that. We're going to give you something better.'""

""It's not about her, it's about the attitude out there -- the attitude that we know best, you do it my way.""

He added: ""I resent that. And I wasn't talking about her, I was talking about the attitude that if you don't agree with me, get in the other party.""

Connecting through grief

The strongest connections Biden makes on the campaign trail often come when opening up about the tragedies he has faced -- and hearing about the deep losses of others.

Asked what it meant to have people take comfort in sharing some of their deep personal tragedies with him, Biden said, ""Well, you know, I have -- a lot of people have suffered more than I have as loss, and I have been really -- sounds bizarre to say -- lucky in the sense that I had an incredible family.""

Biden's wife and infant daughter died in a car crash in 1972 and his sons were injured. His son, Beau, died of brain cancer four years ago.

He went on to explain how his family stepped up to help him raise his children.

""When you're the recipient of someone's understanding and empathy, you understand how it can help and it's just impossible, although sometimes it's hard to not share it with others. When people come up to me often, as you've observed, is they come up and they'll walk up to me and all of a sudden a man or woman will just grab me and hug me and say, 'I just lost my son, lost my daughter, tell me, am I going to be OK, am I going to be OK?' ""

Biden said the best way to overcome tragedy is to find purpose in life.

""Purpose. And a purpose is best utilized if it relates to something that related to what the person you lost cared about,"" he said.

He continued: ""There will come a time if anybody of you are going through it where the thought of the person you lost will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to be able to make it. That's when you know. But it's hard. It's hard. It gives me some -- it gives me some sense of purpose when I'm able to be of some help.""

Contradictory takes on the GOP

Biden repeated a belief he often expresses on the campaign trail: that Republicans will be more willing to work with Democrats if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.

But he also offered a contradictory example -- one that showed, as Biden's Democratic rivals have frequently pointed out, that GOP lawmakers refused to cooperate with Democrats well before Trump became the party's standard-bearer.

Biden pointed to then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in March 2016. Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a hearing.

""I called 12 Republicans and said, 'What are you doing?' "" Biden said. ""I said, 'You realize what you're doing to the Constitution?' They said, 'We know, Joe, but here's the deal: Joe, I'm in a state where if in fact the Koch brothers drop in $10, $12 million, I will lose the primary.' ""

Garland was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Trump was elected later that year.

Still, Biden said, ""I honest to God believe, with Trump out of the way, you're going to find people screwing up a lot more courage than they had before to say, 'OK, OK, I can move now, I have more leeway.'""

Biden didn't explain why, if Republicans had been unbending before Trump due to concerns that they'd anger their conservative base, they'd be more willing to work with Democrats after his departure.

That missing link is part of what Biden's opponents have used against him: As he argues for a return to pre-Trump normalcy, his Democratic rivals -- including Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who bemoans the ""old normal"" -- say that era wasn't working for progressives, either.

Not sweating impeachment politics

Biden expressed no worries about potential electoral backlash on Monday, saying that impeachment proceedings against Trump could help convince independents and Republicans to oppose the President.

Asked whether impeachment proceedings would help or hurt Democrats in the 2020 election, Biden answered that -- no matter the political outcome -- Trump's actions have left the House of Representatives with no choice but to proceed.

""The House has no option. It has to enforce the Constitution, whether or not -- whether or not -- it turns out to work or not work, or whether or not it turns out that he should or shouldn't be kicked out of office,"" he said.

Biden added that if Democrats make a strong case that Trump violated his oath of office, ""you're going to find that those areas that are independent and Republican areas saying, whoa, whoa, we got to do something, we got to do something.""

""That's going to change their view. Let's see where the facts lead us,"" Biden said. He added: ""My job is just to go beat him."""

It's not that he couldn't move faster, it's that he clearly didn't want to. Stopping and talking to people, especially young people there to greet him, is the essence of Biden. Aides joke that it often takes him longer than scheduled for him to get to events because he talks to everyone.

That was vividly on display here, where he was taking part in a Granite State rite of passage: filing for the first-in-the-nation primary here in person. Spending the day with Biden, as CNN did on Friday, was to watch him on the front lines of an increasingly heated two-front war as he seeks his party's presidential nomination in 2020: against his Democratic rivals and also President Donald Trump

Biden continues to face attacks from Trump and his allies over his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. And the former vice president is engaged in an increasingly ugly back and forth with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over health care policy.

When asked if Trump's relentless attacks are helping, without hesitation, he said yes.

""They're helping me in every way,"" Biden tells us, arguing the basics: Democratic voters see that the President considers him a threat.

Biden also suggested that he doesn't want to fight with Warren but feels he has no choice after she suggested his arguments against her plan to fund ""Medicare for All"" meant he was running in the wrong presidential primary. He responded by calling her approach elitist , writing that they ""reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics."" On Friday, in an email to supporters, Warren embraced the angry label, writing, ""I am angry and I own it,"" and said women have been told ""over and over"" that they are not allowed to be angry.

Biden told us attacking Warren, using a term some see as sexist, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""I was responding to a comment she made,"" Biden said. ""She said that anyone who disagreed with her and took her on, on her issue of Medicare for All, somehow either was a coward, wasn't willing to stand up and state what they thought. Somehow doing something -- I think the phrase was should be in a Republican primary. When we talk about Medicare for All, people talk about taking two years, five years, 10 years to get it done. That doesn't give any real reassurance to people out there,"" he explained.

When asked directly whether somebody who supports Medicare for All, a sweeping liberal proposal that would create a national health care system, can beat Donald Trump, Biden demurred.

""I'm not going to make that judgment,"" he told CNN.

Biden's sharpened attacks on Warren comes as a recent Monmouth University poll shows Warren catching Biden at the top of the field among Democrats nationally. She has also placed in the top tier in the most recent surveys of likely Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, while Biden has fallen behind the pack in some early state polls.

The rough reality for Biden, one his campaign started setting expectations about months ago, is that despite being a front-runner, he's not there alone and he very well could lose Iowa and New Hampshire.

If that happened, would his candidacy survive?

""I think I'm going to do better in both places than that,"" Biden insisted.

Pushed again on what would happen, Biden replied: ""Not going to go there,"" he replied.

On the trail

For Biden, being greeted here in New Hampshire by throngs of people holding campaign signs and beating drums (props born out of one of Biden's greatest hits lines -- that he will beat Trump ""like a drum"") was a chance to show passion behind a candidacy that leans hard into the practical.

""Eight years of Donald Trump will forever and fundamentally change the character of this country, and that's why I am running,"" Biden declared at a rally outside on a blustery cold day.

Other candidates, especially his fellow leading contenders like Warren and Bernie Sanders, are selling a wholesale change in approach to governance. Biden is not. He is all about getting Trump out of the White House and says he's the best to do it.

Still, in an interview inside the State House gift shop, he insisted that his candidacy is about more than a pragmatic promise to beat Trump.

""You feel passion for your campaign?"" we asked.

""I do, sure I do. Or I wouldn't be, look, the only reason I'm doing this is because we cannot, we cannot continue down the road of dividing this nation and walking away from the rest of the world,"" he replied, ticking off reasons he said the President has hurt America globally.

It's an understandable approach. Talking to voters who came to see him, many said flatly that the main reason they're considering supporting Biden is because he has the best chance of defeating the President, which anecdotally here, just as in polls of Democratic voters, matters more than anything to them in 2020.

On the stump, Biden's campaign clearly tries to weave in reminders of his experience, with opportunities to show how he has grown.

At a roundtable to discuss the Violence Against Women Act, which he helped write in the Senate, Biden goes deep into the history of how hard it was to convince his male colleagues to make changes that are taken for granted in 2019, like making it illegal for a man to rape his wife.

To show he has a grasp on modern day issues, he reminded the audience that men -- especially trans men -- are frequent victims of violence.

Events like this also allow for Biden to do what Biden does best: emote and empathize. After the event was over and the microphones turned off, he stayed in his seat talking intensely to a woman who told her own story of being a victim of violence.

Later, at a town hall in Franklin, New Hampshire, two of the questioners were children. One about climate change, and another about gun violence.

""How are you going to make schools more safe from mass shootings?"" asked a 10-year-old boy who said his name was Jordan.

""Think about this. Those of you over 30. Could you ever imagine having asked that question?"" responded with a question of his own from the audience.

""You talk about the soul of America. It's a sick soul we have when in fact we send our kids into school these days that duck and cover."" he added.

Third time a charm?

The first time Biden ran for president was 1987. The world has changed a lot since then, and -- riding with him to an event -- he insists he has changed with it. This is Biden's third time running for president, which he admitted is tricky.

""The good news is the bad news. Everybody knows me. Everybody has an opinion. So it's harder to mislabel me or to say something about me that's not true. I have weaknesses. It's easier to talk about the weaknesses, but the generic point is that people know who I am,"" he said.

Familiarity and comfort drew voters we talked to see him, even though some said they're are not sold yet.

Ruth Kovacs and Terri Arangio were at the State House to see Biden wearing his campaign stickers and holding his signs.

But they told us they're still actively candidate shopping.

""Not 100%"" Kovacs said about her support for Biden. ""Personally, I like the middle of the roaders, not far left. I like Amy [Klobuchar], Pete Buttigieg and of course Joe Biden.""

""I've always loved Joe Biden,"" added Arangio.

""He's a likable guy, he says what it is, sometimes he has his gaffes, but I think that's what makes Joe Joe.""

We met several voters who said they came to see Biden in person, a privilege that Granite State voters hold dear, in order to see for themselves if the 76-year-old former vice president seems too old to be president.

Eric Swendsen came to the Franklin town hall with concerns about Biden's age, but told us he felt better after seeing him in action.

""I think he'll be fine. I think he'll be just fine,"" Swendsen said in his post-town hall assessment.

It is a topic we discussed with Biden during our car ride -- that anecdotally older voters who are his age tell us they can't imagine having the stamina to be president.

""What I tell them is, 'Watch me.' Oh God. The one thing that I've learned is, hopefully that age comes with experience, with experience comes with adjustment, and with adjustment comes some wisdom."""

(CNN) While much of the 2019 election discussion focused on the Kentucky and Mississippi gubernatorial contests and the Virginia state legislative races, there were pivotal countywide races in Pennsylvania that provide a much clearer view of the political realignment we have been slowly witnessing for many years in my home state.

Charlie Dent

The lesson learned from Pennsylvania, which went for Donald Trump in 2016, is the same as for the rest of the country. As a result of his election and performance in office, the suburbs are nearly completely gone for the Republican Party.

When I was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1990 from an Allentown-based district, Republicans performed very well in the suburbs and dominated rural areas. There were even a few Republicans like me who were winning elections in urban areas and even more Democrats who were successful in rural communities throughout the state and well beyond the Philadelphia region.

But things were slowly changing. In 1990, while I and two other Republicans were defeating entrenched Democratic state House incumbents in the Lehigh Valley, a perennial bellwether and swing region of eastern Pennsylvania, an almost unheard of young man and young woman defeated an entrenched Democratic congressman and Democratic state senator, respectively, from the other side of the state, in the Pittsburgh area. Their names: Rick Santorum and Melissa Hart.

Four years later Rick Santorum became a US senator, and ten years later Melissa Hart gained a seat in the US House of Representatives. These 1990 election results were shocking to the political class at that time. How did five Republicans defy political gravity to win Democratic districts in the midterm election during the Presidency of George H.W. Bush? This should not have happened, but what we were witnessing was an emerging trend.

Steyer also promised immediate action to combat the climate crisis , promising to invoke ""emergency powers"" on the first day of his presidency as a means of tackling the issue.

But the longtime Democratic donor and impeachment advocate also cast himself as a moderate in opposition to the progressive frontrunners, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , with his support for a public health insurance option, suggesting it would be less disruptive to implement than the sweeping ""Medicare for All"" plan the two progressive senators support.

Here are four takeaways from Steyer's town hall:

Steyer puts Bloomberg on the spot

Steyer took early aim at Bloomberg, saying the former New York City mayor should either get on board with a wealth tax or think twice about pursuing the Democratic nomination.

""Unless Mr. Bloomberg is willing to accept a wealth tax, I don't believe he can be an appropriate nominee for the Democratic Party,"" Steyer, who supports the policy, said early on in the evening.

He also pledged to ""undo"" all of the tax cuts given to the wealthiest Americans and corporations over the past four decades.

""The distribution of wealth across society is an absolute scandal,"" he said.

Bloomberg on Friday filed to run in Alabama's Democratic presidential primary in 2020, in the clearest sign to date that the former mayor is seriously considering following through with something he has been weighing for weeks.

Steyer: Judge me by how I handled scandals

In South Carolina , a Steyer adviser resigned after being outed for accessing volunteer data compiled by Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign.

In Iowa , a Steyer adviser resigned after being accused of offering money in exchange for endorsements.

But on Sunday night, Steyer argued that his reaction to those scandals -- and not critics' suggestion of a culture of impropriety -- is what voters should focus on.

""Unauthorized things happen (in campaigns) and the question is what you're going to do about them,"" he said. ""In both those cases, we did exactly what I think is appropriate. We went in, we figured out what happened, we took action.""

By immediately acting to secure resignations from the individuals accused, Steyer said, his campaign was actually demonstrating a unique strength.

""That's exactly what you look for in an organization -- that you have rules that are enforced by the organization when something that is not proper occurs,"" Steyer said.

""You deal with it with the highest possible integrity, you actually walk the walk of doing the right thing, and then you move on.""

Steyer breaks with progressive leaders on health care

""Medicare for All"" is not for Tom Steyer.

The billionaire businessman said he would prefer to build on the current system, as it exists under the Affordable Care Act, and push for a public option, or a government-backed insurance plan.

The issue, he argued, was one of choice.

""I happen to be one of the people who believes in a public option, giving people the option basically of joining Medicare, but allowing 160 million people to make the decision for themselves,"" Steyer said.

Steyer also pointed to organized labor, and union members who have negotiated for their insurance, as a reason he would shy away from a more radical shift.

""I don't think it's right for the government to tell them that we're going to scrap a 75-year-old system. If you like it, keep doing it,"" he said. ""If the public option is cheaper and better for you, then you can go to your employer and say pay me the money you're spending on my health care, I'll buy the public option.""

Climate change comes first in a Steyer White House

How is Tom Steyer different from his primary rivals when it comes to climate change?

The answer, he said, is simple: It is his ""number one priority"" -- taking precedent over any and all other issues.

Steyer on Sunday said he would declare a state of emergency on climate on his first day in office and use the emergency powers of the presidency ""to make changes immediately.""

He also pledged to demand Congress to pass a version of the Green New Deal during his first 100 days in office.

""I've spent over a decade fighting oil companies and beating them at the ballot box. I've led the charge for clean energy across the country at the ballot box,"" Steyer said. ""I've worked to stop pipelines. I've worked to stop fossil fuel plants. We're talking about the future, but you can look at my history and know that this is something that is an absolutely top priority for me.""

Steyer added he does not fly private, and said he hopes the rest of the Democratic field would promise to forswear it too."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D), a Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday revealed.

Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed.

The Monmouth University poll, taken November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren’s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth’s previous poll.

No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three — Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:

Bullock 1%

Castro 1%

Bennet 0%

Bloomberg 0%

Delaney 0%

Williamson 0%

Sestak 0% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) November 12, 2019

According to Monmouth, Buttigieg “has gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.”

Per Monmouth:

His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren). Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden’s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders). Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren).

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said, noting that the presidential hopeful’s support cannot be attributed to any one group.

“While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,” he continued. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent."

“I think you should ask him. For me, this is really talking about … all the little girls who came up just now and who’ve done pinky promises. … We’re here, we’re strong, and we have strong views,” Warren stated.

The beef between the two escalated after Warren unveiled her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan — a plan which she claims will not require a middle class tax hike. Biden’s Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield remarked on the “mathematical gymnastics” used in Warren’s proposal, and the Massachusetts senator suggested that Biden was guilty of using “Republican talking points.”

“Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don’t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,” she said.

Biden defended his position in a Medium post last week, noting that Warren’s attack reflects “an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,” although he did not mention her by name.

“The other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,” he wrote.

He continued:

But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn’t agree with you — it’s not just that you disagree — that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.

Warren subtly attributed Biden’s description — describing her as “angry” — to sexism.

“I am angry and I own it,” a Friday fundraising email from Warren read.

“Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,” it continued.

The former vice president denied his critique had anything to do with sexism and doubled down on his remarks during CNN’s town hall Monday evening."

She recently unveiled her sarcastic “calculator for the billionaires,” which she used to hit Michael Bloomberg directly:

However, Cuban believes Warren is incessantly targeting the ultra-wealthy to distract the general public from her own wealth. She and her husband have a net worth of over $12 million, according to Forbes.

“The reality for @ewarren is that this is as much to divert attention from her income and net worth as anything else,” he wrote over the weekend. “Other than steyer she is the wealthiest of all the Dem Candidates. By far”:

He continued, noting that Warren actually qualifies as a “one-percenter” herself.

“According to her filings she made 900k last year which means her family earns more than 2x the amount needed to be a 1 percenter,” Cuban stated. “She paid 25.5% of that in taxes which is less than the % I paid in taxes (29.85%).”

“Forbes says her networth is north of $12m,” he continued. “That’s being rich. Filthy rich. I’m sure it’s richer than she ever imagined she would be.”

“Good for her. She earned it. It puts her millions above the threshold for being part of the richest 1 percent by networth in our country,” he added:

While he appeared to approve of the intentions behind Warren’s proposals, many of which would be funded my hiking taxes on the wealthy, Cuban says she has “several fundamental issues in her plans.”

“First she needs quite a few things to pass Congress in order for any of it to work. Is it realistic to think any of it will pass let alone all of it?” he asked:

Cuban said the presidential hopeful is “probably is the smartest of all the candidates,” which means “intellectually she knows she is misleading the public,” particularly when it comes to her Medicare for All proposal:

“I’m fine with paying more taxes. I’ve said it for years on http://blogmaverick.com,” Cuban said.

“But the Senator is like every other candidate. She is selling shiny objects to divert attention from reality,” he added, taking a dig at President Trump:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), started the war of words that has escalated between the two camps over Medicare for All.

Biden, who is one of the only 2020 Democrats to come out in opposition to the universal health care proposal, was asked during a televised CNN town hall in Iowa about criticisms he made regarding Warren’s “elitist” brand of politics. The former vice president made the remarks last week in a self-published Medium piece after Warren suggested he was running in the wrong presidential primary because he was unwilling to support Medicare for All.

“Let’s get something straight, she attacked me,” Biden said when asked about the dust up. “She went out and said…Biden is a coward, Biden is…and she went down the list of saying I should be in a Republican primary. What do you call that?”

The former vice president defended his decision to write the Medium piece, saying there was an “attitude that exists” in the country right now that “if you disagree with me, you must be bad.” Despite the pleas for civility and understanding, Biden proceeded to lambast Warren’s views and attitude as “elitist” and condescending once more. Although the moderator, CNN’s Erin Burnett, attempted to push back against Biden’s comments, what ended up being lost in the mix was that the former vice president had started the altercation over Medicare for All.

Earlier this month, Biden accused Warren of lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she would pay for it during an interview with “PBS News Hour.”

“She’s making it up,” the former vice president said when asked about cost estimates Warren’s campaign had released on the proposal. “Look, nobody thinks it’s $20 trillion. It’s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that’s gone out there, that’s taken a look at this, there is no way — even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can’t even meet the cost of it.”

Even prior to the interview, Biden’s campaign had been pressuring Warren for months to explain how she would cover the costs associated from Medicare for All, which some estimate could run upwards of $32 trillion, without raising taxes on the middle class. When the Massachusetts Democrats did finally answer that question with a detailed proposal, Biden’s campaign jumped to claim she was promising to raise taxes on middle class families, even though Warren expressly pledged in her plan there would be “no middle class tax increases.”

“For months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does,” Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president’s deputy campaign manger, said at the time. “Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.”

Warren, herself, responded to the attack while campaigning in Iowa by accusing the former vice president of “repeating Republican talking points” on Medicare for All to the benefit of insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry.

“If anyone wants to defend keeping those high profits for insurance companies…drug companies…and not making corporations pay a fair share in taxes,” the senator said, “then I think they’re running in the wrong presidential primary.”

Warren, in part, was echoing her progressive rival from Vermont, Sanders, with the attack. In July, Sanders had publicly accused Biden of parroting GOP talking points in an effort to undermine the credibility of Medicare for All.

“Obviously what Biden was doing is what the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries, Republicans, do: ignoring the fact that people will save money on their health care because they will no longer have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket expenses,” Sanders, who authored the initial Medicare for Al bill in 2017, told The New York Times over the summer.

Regardless if the rebuke had partially been used before, Warren’s suggestion that Biden should be running as a Republican sent the former vice president’s team spinning. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, even claimed Warren has no right to question his Democrat credentials since she herself was a Republican until the age of 47-years-old.

You have to be kidding me. Warren was a Republican until she was 47 years old while Joe Biden has spent his life helping elect Democrats across the country and served with honor in the Senate and with Pres Obama. https://t.co/E9CESedasL — Greg Schultz (@schultzohio) November 1, 2019

When that attack failed to get traction, Biden penned his Medium piece, accusing Warren of brandishing an “elitist” and “condescending” brand of politics that was eroding the national discourse. Although the former vice president never once mentioned Warren in the piece, his rigorous defense of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option left little to the imagination.

The flare-up between the two camps underscores the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as 32 percentage points at one point, his campaign has steadily declined in recent months.

Biden’s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren’s have only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin.

As the candidates standing in the 2020 field has reversed, with Warren being described as the frontrunner by even some of Biden’s former Obama administration colleagues, the former vice president has only escalated his criticism, as exhibited at the CNN town hall on Monday.

“I’m more of a Democrat from my shoe sole to my ears than about anybody running in this party,” Biden claimed, before clarifying that also included Warren."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Monday unveiled his $62 billion plan to revamp the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), promising to end the exclusion on what the presidential hopeful describes as “medically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries” and emphasizing the need to provide “abortion care.”

The former chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee unveiled his VA plan on Veterans Day, proposing $62 billion in new funding to revamp the VA.

“Today, due to serious underfunding, the VA’s infrastructure is crumbling and in vital need of repair. VA hospitals have gone without needed updates and maintenance, and outpatient clinics and Vet Centers have gone unopened,” Sanders’ plan states.

“As President, Bernie will invest at least $62 billion in the infrastructure needed to provide the cutting-edge health care services our veterans have earned and deserve,” it continues.

A good portion of Sanders’ plan is devoted to guaranteeing quality health care for veterans, which he believes Medicare for All will enhance.

“Coupled with Medicare for All, veterans will be able to rely on a health care system that is working for them, not against them; a system focused on a person’s health, not their ability to pay,” his plan states.

Part of that quality medical care, Sanders assesses, should include the ability to undergo taxpayer-funded “medically necessary gender affirmation surgeries” and receive what he calls “abortion care.”

As president, Sanders would “end the VA’s blanket exclusion on medically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries” and “ensure that women veterans will no longer be forced outside the VA system for basic women’s health services, including fertility treatment, abortion care, or specialized cancer treatment and prevention services.”

Sanders is not the only presidential candidate to focus on taxpayer-funded “transition-related” surgeries as part of his VA plan.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) promised “gender-affirming and culturally-competent” health care for LGBT service members and veterans as part of her comprehensive veterans plan released last week.

“A Warren VA will ensure that every LGBTQ+ person can get the equitable, gender-affirming, and culturally-competent health care they need,” Warren’s plan states.

“That means providing all medically necessary care related to the health of transgender people, including transition-related surgery, and allowing providers discretion to deem gender-affirming procedures as medically necessary based on an individualized assessment,” it continues, noting that such surgeries will be available under her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan as well.

“This care will also be available under Medicare for All. Professional medical associations recognize the need for transition-related surgery,” her plan states.

“VA’s blanket exclusion policy of medically necessary treatment is not grounded in medicine; it should be repealed,” it adds."

They couldn’t be more different except for the results of the last two Quinnipiac University polls, which both show 4 candidates in the top tier,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy stated, warning that the state’s lineup is “far from rock solid.”

“Although Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it’s far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs,” Malloy added.

Quinnipiac also asked 636 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters if they would support Michael Bloomberg. Only two percent signaled they would “definitely” support him, while 37 percent said they “would consider voting for him.” The majority, 54 percent, said they “definitely would not vote for him.” The margin of error for that question is +/- 5 percent.

“If he truly is in, there is a lot of work to do. But with vast resources to draw from, Michael Bloomberg’s nascent campaign could morph from ‘under construction’ to ‘full steam ahead’ in a New York minute,” Malloy said."

In other words, unless someone gets off the pot, the current 2020 crop of tired, old extremists is locked in forever. Which means one of them will face Trump in 2020, and a quick look around shows that Democrats are not happy about that.

There are rumblings about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg seriously considering taking the plunge. There’s even talk about former Attorney General Eric Holder. And because she’s a vampire who keeps coming back in terrible sequels, there’s Hillary.

No one knows what’s going to happen, but it was not supposed to be like this…

For the last four years, Trump has been smeared by the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) as a crazed rapist, racist, and traitor owned by the Russians who must be impeached… Gee, 2020 should be a lay-up for Democrats; after all, we have all those Fox News polls proving Trump is down something like 99 points to every Democrat politician in America, including Ted Kennedy’s corpse.

Why so nervous, Democrats?

Why so nervous, media?

Why this search for a last-minute ringer when the walls are closing in on Drumpf fer realsies this time?

Well, if there’s one thing Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) remember, it’s how meaningless those polls were in 2020… And what I mean by “remember” is “still haven’t come to terms with or accepted.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is the great slight hope, has the best chance against Trump, and he’s not only a walking-talking example of the physical and mental deterioration that awaits those of us lucky enough to live so long, no matter how much the media scream HOAX on his behalf, this Ukraine-China-Hunter thing is a real problem.

Biden was a terrible candidate before he started operating just a notch above “zombie.” Today he’s not just a mess, his son Hunter’s appallingly mercenary, greedy, and unethical business practices, his shameless looting of two countries while his sitting-vice president father led American policy there, is something the Trump campaign is already exploiting.

Remember how Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election team looked at the lay of the Republican presidential field and correctly guessed Mitt Romney would come out on top? It was a gamble, but with an unlimited pile of money, it really wasn’t, and that unlimited pile of money allowed Team Obama to define Romney as a corporate raider even before he secured the nomination.

It was a brilliant play on Obama’s part, and it worked, and now Team Trump is doing the same to Biden. The far-left Politico reports the Trump campaign has spent $287,000 just in Iowa on ads that blast Biden over Ukraine, and this pales compared to the money spent on ads targeting Biden on Facebook and YouTube.

Biden is already getting roughed up and defined by Trump, his numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are cratering, and while he’s still in the lead nationally, he’s nowhere near the safe zone of 35 percent. Regardless, Iowa and New Hampshire matter. If you lose there, your national lead evaporates mighty quick.

And if Biden loses the nomination, that leaves the socialists Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg, the 11-year-old mayor black people can’t stand.

Help us, Michael Bloomberg, you’re our only hope…

The New York Post’s Michael Goodwin is a smart political observer immune to the conventional wisdom that is always wrong, and he thinks Bloomberg is a good bet for Democrats. He makes some good points, but Bloomberg’s biggest problem — by far — is that he has no natural constituency. For all his own problems, Biden has the working class and blacks. Warren and Sanders have the far-far-left. Buttigieg is making a serious play for the same kind of young people who fell in love with Obama.

Who does Bloomberg have? He’s a billionaire businessman, a pushing 80 technocrat… He might be seen as a “moderate” in the Democrat Party, a centrist, but that is where he stands politically, which has zero to do with winning votes. Amy Klobuchar is a centrist — she’s polling at 1 percent. John Hickenlooper is a centrist governor from the swing state of Colorado, he’s already been forced to drop out. The term “centrist” is meaningless without a constituency.

Sure, never bet against a guy who can write a check for $52 billion, but already Bloomberg has said he would not even try to win Iowa and New Hampshire, which I guess is a strategy — a BAD Strategy. We have decades of data proving Iowa and New Hampshire matter. You either get shot out of one of those cannons or you are doomed.

Ask Rudy Giuliani about this strategy. One of the most beloved politicians in 2008 doomed himself under the belief he could ignore Iowa and New Hampshire as he sat on his national and Florida lead and waited for the campaign to come to him. But by the time it did, he had collapsed in the polls.

Yes, Democrats have every reason to be nervous, and after Republicans turn these impeachment hearings into The Joe and Hunter Biden Looted Ukraine and China Show, they will have even more reason.

While mainstream media are reporting some polls that suggest Trump is losing the support of women, the report by Open Secrets, part of the Center for Responsive Politics, shows the president has over 10,500 large-dollar contributions from women in suburbs, and has received $8,293,135 from them – the largest amount than any of the Democrat 2020 candidates.

“Suburban women, who power a significant electoral battleground, are a key demographic for 2020,” wrote Grace Haley at the research group that tracks money in U.S. politics. “Since Trump’s inauguration, more than 7,000 women in suburban districts have given large-dollar contributions to his campaign. That totals $8 million, the most of all candidates.”

Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner, drew attention to the Open Secrets report.

He noted that 28 percent of Trump’s “itemized contributions” were from women in 2016.

“For the 2020 election, they are 35 [percent],” Bedard reported.

On paper, Trump ranks fifth in donations from women at $15.1 million, with the leader in donations from women reported from Sen. Bernie Sanders at $17.1 million, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who have all raised $15 million or more from women, Open Secrets reported.

However, the research group also observed that “Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million” since the Trump campaign does not report demographic information about its small donors:

Campaigns are not required to itemize donations of $200 or less, so we do not have demographic information about Trump’s small donors giving to his joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee, Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. An estimated 59 percent of Trump’s donations are from small-donors, so Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million. Trump’s totals are underestimated more than the other candidates. Because Democrats are relying on ActBlue and the Republicans are not relying on the Republican equivalent WinRed as significantly, we only have most (not all) donor demographic data for Democratic small-dollar donors.

Amy Kremer, chairwoman of Women for America First and co-founder and chair of Women for Trump PAC, told Breitbart News it is “no surprise that women are contributing to the president’s campaign” since many women in suburbs have families and children.

“Women are focused on issues that impact our children and our families and President Trump is delivering results,” she said, adding that when women contribute to his campaign “it’s an easy donation when you know what you are going to get in return and this president has followed through on his promises, and his policies have been good for women and their families.”

Open Secrets noted the Trump campaign says there are often more suburban women supporting the president than reported because “the polling data does not account for suburban women who favor Trump but do not feel comfortable publicly saying so.”

Kremer agreed with this statement.

“Not all women who support the President may be vocal about their support, but they are quietly doing their share to ensure another four years of America First with President Trump,” she said."

Savage Warns Trump on Impeachment: Senate Republicans Cannot Be Trusted

Not only is the Trump presidency at a critical juncture, but so is the United States. The House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), is set to go public with testimonies from key witnesses from the administration this week. While House Republicans, and for the most part, their colleagues in the Senate, have stood united against efforts to impeach President Trump, Savage cautions the upper chamber’s GOP members could ultimately join their Democrat counterparts in voting to remove the president.

“They’ll go whichever way the wind blows,” Savage predicts, pointing to how Republican Senators have repeatedly broken their promises to voters, referencing their decades-old failure to secure the porous Southern border.

“They’re quislings and are liable to go against [Trump] if push comes to shove. I don’t trust them as far as I can throw them and an elephant is their symbol. They never liked him, they never wanted an outsider in the presidency. They wanted someone who was amongst their club,” he adds. “The club machine on both sides decides who will become president. Along came this outsider, this gruff, vulgar businessman, and they hate him and still do. I don’t trust many of them, if any of them.”

2020 Democrats Don’t Stand a Chance vs. President Trump

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) $52 trillion “Medicare for All” proposal to now-defeated “Beto” O’Rourke’s vow to forcibly confiscate an estimated 16 million AR-15s, the Democratic White House primary field is arguably the most far-left in U.S. history. The party’s leftward lurch, coupled with former Vice President Joe Biden’s slipshod campaign performance, may prompt billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to jump into the race. Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is even being floated as a potential contender. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination, Savage’s chips are on the incumbent.

“Warren is unelectable,” Savage says bluntly at the mention of her. “This college Communist is unelectable.”

“She is the most despicable of all of the candidates, next to Bernie Sanders, because her policies are as Marxist as his and in a package just as distasteful as his. He is a crumpled old seltzer man from New York, who you wouldn’t trust your child around,” he quips. “There is a meanness to her face that’s not missed on the electorate, particularly with women. Women know women, better than men know women, and women distrust Elizabeth Warren because they know the type.”

Savage then argues the Democrat field’s pessimistic economic message is wildly out of touch with the reailites of today’s booming job market. Under President Trump, the economy has added 5.1 million jobs, while unemployment has dropped to the lowest rate in nearly half a century.

“They are lecturing us on jobs when Donald Trump is the greatest job creator in the history of America,” Savage states. “How can they run on jobs when we have almost full employment right now? They’re running on a campaign slogan from a time of recession. They’re still stuck in the 1930s. They’re not selling pencils at Grand Central Station right now or selling apples in the street. Everyone who wants to work is working and everyone else is a damn bum.”

Borders, Language, and Culture: A Clairvoyant Credo

Savage has built a large and loyal audience based on many things: His farsighted, politically independent analysis and predictions; captivating storytelling; a no-nonsense, straight-talking demeanor; his dark humor; and his ability to weave culture and religion into any subject at any time. Yet, not even Savage, author of over 40 books, five of which are New York Times bestsellers, would argue that he is most famous for being the originator of the political philosophy: “Borders, Language and Culture.”

Simply, without this trio of ingredients, it is impossible for a country to exist, let alone survive.

“I created the Paul Revere society when I began in radio in 1994,” Savage says. “The organizational theme of it was Borders, Language, Culture — the defining elements of a nation. How did I come up with that? Common sense. There’s not a nation on earth that’s not defined, or was not defined until recently — when the globalists like Angela Merkel, who destroyed Germany and others destroyed nations by making their borders disappear.”

He continues: “Without a common language, you have a Tower of Babel and the nation falls apart because there’s no cohesion. Do you understand the globalists purposely wanted to create Towers of Babel in every western nation in order to weaken and destroy them? What does culture mean? The U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, ring a bell? Do you realize most immigrants don’t know what the Declaration of Independence was or who wrote it? They could care less about the Constitution. All they know is they have rights. The minute they arrive here illegally, doesn’t matter how, they already have a card in their hand and that is ‘I have rights, go to hell.’ They say that to ICE, they say it to the police. They have it all written out by the vermin in the ACLU.”

“You go to any Caribbean nation that’s independent, do you know they all have voter-ID? Grenada, you name it. They say, ‘of course we have voter-ID, how else would we have knowledge of who are voting in our elections? This means anyone can come in and vote. Why don’t you have it?’ Ask Nancy Pelosi. Ask Chuck Schumer, Ask Dianne Feinstein, the devils of our time,” he adds.

Savage then turns his attention to Schiff, who he says would never have been allowed to conduct secret depositions if American lawmakers governed the country upholding the tenets of B.L.C.

“They want the nation to be broken over their knees so they can play with it like nutty-putty like Adam Schiff is doing with our Constitution,” he states. “Do you think a guy like this could get away with secret star-chamber hearings if most American people spoke the same language and understood the Constitution and Bill of Rights? He could never get away with it. A low-life scumbag could never be where he is in a nation where people understand the founding documents and the language of the land.”

Savage — who holds master’s degrees in anthropology and ethnobotany from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a Ph.D in nutritional ethnomedicine from University of California, Berkeley — then draws on his extensive background of as trained biologist to explain B.C.L. in scientific terms.

“The essence of every living thing is the cell, where it be a plant cell or an animal cell. What is it that holds a cell together? In an animal cell, it’s the cell membrane. The cell membrane is the border of the cell. If you make the cell membrane porous, where things can come in and go out, the cell falls apart. It dissolves because it has no identity. It becomes a massive protoplasm,” he explains. “That’s what’s happening as a result of left-wing fanatics, who have put acid on our cell membranes, or our plant cell walls. Without borders, there are no national boundaries, without a common language, there’s no common cohesion, we have a Tower of Babel, and without a common culture, we have no unity among the people. That makes it easier for the devils that are trying to create this new world order to destroy a nation by controlling it from afar.”

Trump-China Trade Battle: Deal or No Deal?

One of the many ways President Trump has changed Washington, DC, is that he has awoken Democrats and Republicans to the gargantuan threat China poses not only to the U.S., but to the West and beyond. Beijing’s sins are capacious, ranging from mass spying, intellectual property threat, currency manipulation, and failure to uphold agreements with trading partners. The Communist country’s reported imprisonment of roughly one-million Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province. along with its draconian censorship and social credit rating system, are horrifying in their own way. Unsurprisingly, Savage has raised the alarm regarding the Red Dragon, and despite President Trump’s historic efforts to reverse Beijing’s unfair trade policies, he does not share the president’s optimism that a deal with the world’s second-largest economy is reachable.

“It’s a smokescreen,” Savage says of the president’s ongoing negotiations with China. “The business interests in America are so powerful. They all oppose tariffs because they’ve gotten used to doing business with China and they don’t care about the longterm, holistic effects. They don’t care about trade imbalances, they don’t care about the military, all the care about is the bottom line.”

“I believe the Better Business Bureau of America as represented by Mitch McConnell and company are totally opposed to tariffs and no matter what deal Trump announces, at the end of the day, there will be no deal. It will be the same deal that’ll screw the American people for all of these decades. I’m not optimistic at all,” he goes on.

He then points to North Korea’s recent missile tests as an another example of how President Trump’s efforts to reach agreements with adversaries have yet to come to fruition, raising the prospect that the Swamp could quietly torpedo such deals.

“I think it’s going to be another smokescreen like the peace deal with North Korea. We kept hearing about how wonderful negotiations with North Korea are and how we outsmarted Kim-Jong-Mentally-Il-Un. As far as I can tell, he’s still firing off missiles with impunity,” says Savage. “I don’t think that the North Korean deal, whatever that may be, is a deal at all. He’s doing exactly what he wants. Iran is re-running the centrifuges. Where is the deal there? We keep hearing about these great deals, but unfortunately, maybe they are great deals and then the Senate goes behind the president’s back and undermines him and our national security.”

King of San Francisco for a Day

The decline of San Francisco, or San Fran-sicko, as Savage affectionally calls his adopted city, has long been well documented. In 1974, he moved to the city by the bay with his wife and two young children due to its then-sterling public school system. Under the leadership of Mayor Willie Brown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and Gov. Jerry Brown, the Democrat-controlled city and the state of California as a whole have increasingly worsened. If “Uncle Mike,” as he is known to long-time listers, could issue any decrees of his choice for 24 hours as mayor, what issues would he tackle to stop the decay?

The foundational issues: Education, healthcare and illegal immigration, of course.

“A struggling family who was working could see there children going through school to the highest level at a very low cost,” Savage says of the San Francisco public schools when he first moved to the city. “California had the best schools in the country, now they’re the worst. What happened? The mass flood of illegal aliens, who became the darlings of the education establishment. So much money was going to bilingual education, but that’s not where it ended. In Nancy Pelosi’s backyard, San Francisco, the ballots are put out in at least eight languages so they can net in every illegal alien to vote in the city for these corrupt Democrat machine politicians. That’s number one, number two, and number ten,” he says in reference to the issues he would fix.

“Illegal aliens have destroyed the state and the city. People go, ‘oh they come here to work.’ Bullsh*t, they come here to work. If you look at the rate of abuse of the welfare system, and the hospitals are overwhelmed. I speak to doctors, I speak to nurses. The healthcare system has been destroyed in this state,” he exclaims.

“I live near the San Fransico Bay and I watch birds every day. Before my show, I feed them bread. A couple of days before, I see a variety of species: seagulls, cormorant, pelicans. It’s beautiful to see them all sitting out there. They don’t kill each other, they don’t fight with each other over fish in the bay. They all get along. Is that really true in a sanctuary city, where we all get along? I don’t think so,” he adds. “When you take a group and displace them with another group, where did the group that was displaced go? What do they feel like? How did it happen so rapidly? And why did it happen so rapidly? Who was behind the invasion of California in America?”

Conservationists and Animal Welfare Advocates: Key Part of Trump’s Base?

While President Trump has denounced trophy hunting as a “horror show,” the Department of Interior has made the importation endangered animals as trophies easier. In October, a bipartisan group of Congress members introduced the Prohibiting Threatened and Endangered Creature Trophies Act of 2019 (ProTECT) Act to prevent the hunting of any endangered or threatened species. Savage, a noted dogfather of a poodle named “Teddy,” says the Trump administration should be protecting animals or risk turning off millions of educated suburban women across the country.

“It’s a very important issue. It’s not only important to me,” Savage says. “I believe this, and people may not know this, is they say President Trump’s support among educated suburbanite women has languished a bit. I’m telling you as I stand here, that’s because of environmental and animal policies that are contrary to educated people, whether they be women, suburbanites, or otherwise. I’ve tried to get this message across to both the president and to others in the administration. And guess what? In-person, they agree with me. But, apparently, the powers that be in the Department of Interior are so powerful that even they don’t have any control over it.”

“They know they’re vulnerable on these issues,” he adds. “Whoever is doing the internal polling is absolutely blind to environmental and animal welfare issues. They are living in the 1940s, a ‘go out and kill an elephant and put his head on a wall’ mentality. It’s 2019, we’re not living in 1918. Most educated people know you can’t slaughter everything on the planet and pave over all the wilderness and call it American greatness.”

The Importance of Art in a Savage Life

Andrew Breitbart’s main thesis was politics is downstream from culture. There is no better proof of his vindication than Barack Obama, the Democratic Party’s first “celebrity” president. Hollywood is unmatched in its ability to shape American life, and though Savage frequently rails against popular culture, he understands the power of art. In a world chalked of cold truths, he uses paintings and classical music to bring color to his life and work.

“Woah, nobody’s ever asked me that before,” Savage replies when asked about how art has shaped him. “I grew up as a little boy in my father’s little antique store in Manhattan. He used to sell bronze statues. He taught me at a very early age the difference between a fine sculpture and a bad one. He would say, ‘look at the toes and fingers. Many artists could sculpt a figure very well, but the real test is how to sculpt the toes and the fingers.’ You start with the little details and you work your way back from there.”

“Classic figures are what I like. I’m not a huge fan of modern art, but I understand it. I’ve looked at Picasso’s split images of women’s faces. However, I’m a classicist in terms of what I prefer in my own house.”

“I love jazz music, as you well know,” he continues, listing off a series of jazz legends such as Art Blakey, Charlie Parker, and Kenny Burrell. “I love classic rock and roll. I’m moved to tears when I listen to classic music. I lose the ability to speak. If I listen to Beethoven, I can’t speak because every few centuries someone comes along that’s so outside the human experience in the greatness that they overwhelm the senses in terms of their genius. The beauty of nature, the artistry of God’s hand in nature, is expressed in man’s attempt to create beauty in his paintings and sculptings.”

The purpose of art, Savage says, is “to create what God created on earth through man’s hands or with his voice.”

The Reinvention of Savage as a Radio Star

Change is hard no matter someone’s age. But that didn’t deter Savage from transforming himself from health supplement expert to a conservative talker at the age of 50. How did he rise to the top of conservative media, and what propelled him there?

“Because of affirmative action, which is aimed at white, heterosexual males, my birthright as an immigrant’s son was stolen from me,” Savage explains. “I’m one of the few people in the media whose father was an immigrant to America. I’m very proud of that fact. He came here from Russia at seven years old. I’ve been working since I was a young kid, and I don’t want to stop working now. If God wants me to stop, he’ll let me know pretty quickly.”

“I went into radio because I was so infuriated by what was done to me, how I had my birthright stolen right from me from the left-wing through affirmative action. They denied me what I was qualified for. All I wanted to be was a college professor. We’re in a war and we’re losing the culture war. The march to the institutions has been won a long time ago.”

“I took a chance. I cut a demo tape in Sausalito, California. I had my wife call in as a caller, I had two friends call in. It was a lot of fun. I had no idea what might happen. Four stations said, ‘you’re really good, we’d like to hire you.’ One was in Boston and another in San Francisco,” he reminisces. “It was KGO at the time, and they put me on at night. What was I getting at? I was getting even. I reached more people in a single show then I would have reached teaching for an entire year in a university. It’s my way of saying, ‘go to hell.’

“I’m as motivated today as the day I began. I have the same passion for the subjects that I have.”

Savage Reflects on Life as a Conservative in San Francisco Speech

On October 29th, Savage delivered a rare speech at the University Club of San Francisco, where he mused for roughly an hour about everything from politics to culture; fashion, jokes, and personal anecdotes about President Trump and were sprinkled through his remarks before an engaged and lively audience. There isn’t much Savage hasn’t accomplished in his career: top-rated show, loyal fanbase, best-selling author, and political influencer.

However, as he’s acknowledged to his listeners, radio lacks instant feedback from listeners. Sometimes everybody needs a human connection.

“Radio is an anonymous medium. I work alone out of my home. You begin to miss human contact,” Savage responds when asked why he wanted to hold the event. “I’m a member of this University Club and I rarely go there. I was approached by their president, who seems to be politically conservative. He’s an anomaly. He asked if I’d be willing to speak at the club, so we can get some like-minded people, and I said sure. It started out with 15-20 people, but of course, I don’t do many live performances, and it sold out rapidly,” he says. “I decided to put the video up of the event at SavageNationLive.com because there were thousands of people who would have liked to be there.

“It started as a desire to meet like-minded people in this club. I was told a lot of young people there are conservative, which is an interesting phenomenon going in San Franciso and around the country. You wouldn’t know it from the media, but that’s what’s going on. Would I do it again? I doubt it,” Savage says.

“I entitled the event as ‘Life as a Conservative in San Francisco.’ I gave the people one hour of entertainment. None of it was heavy politics. I thought, what would Mark Twain do if he were here? I tried to write the humor as if it were him. You can be politically conservative and also be very humorous. It seems that the left owns the entertainment business, but they really don’t. They just exclude people,” he adds.

The Savage Truth

Although Savage has spent the last 25 years fighting for America every day on the airwaves, the radio host has his doubts about whether the country can continue on the path it’s on.

“No, I’m pessimistic,” Savage says bluntly. “I think Donald Trump, even if he wins a second term, it is the last gasp of America as we know it. I think we’re going to enter years and years, if not decades of darkness.”

“I see the mass of illegal immigrants, who are illiterate even in their own language. They have none of our shared values. They will never be Americans and embrace the values that built this country. They’ve been steeped in hatred for this nation by the media and the universities. And they have a very dim view of our nation, even though they love the benefits that have accrued from far better people than them,” he concludes."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday, pointing to her advocacy for ""Medicare for All"" and saying it comes from an elitist belief that Americans shouldn't be allowed to make up their own minds on health care.

The former vice president's comments came at a CNN town hall in Iowa. During the town hall, Biden also discussed how he has connected with Americans on the campaign trail about grief. Additionally, he said he isn't worried about potential political blowback from House Democrats' impeachment proceedings.

He offered a contradictory view on Republicans, insisting they'll be more willing to work with Democrats after President Donald Trump leaves office -- while telling a story about them refusing to cooperate before Trump had even become the GOP presidential nominee.

Here are four takeaways from Biden's town hall:

Attacking Warren

Biden continued to characterize Warren as ""angry"" and ""elitist,"" saying her health care plan is driven by a belief that ""people can't make up their own mind.""

The former vice president also said he's merely been responding after ""she attacked me.""

He was referring to Warren jabbing at him for his opposition to Medicare for All, suggesting without naming the former vice president that he is running in the wrong party's presidential primary. Biden has escalated his criticism of Warren over that comment in recent days. In a Medium post published last week, he wrote that Warren, without naming her, was ""condescending"" and ""representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share.""

Biden said his criticism wasn't about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs.

This time mimicking Medicare for All proponents, Biden said Monday that what he's been calling elitist was ""the attitude that we know better than ordinary people what's in their interests. 'I know more than you, let me tell you what to do.'""

""The attitude is elitist that people can't make up their own mind,"" Biden said.

""You like your health insurance,"" he said, then dropped to a lower voice: ""'But you shouldn't like your health insurance, you should have to give that up. I'm going to demand you not have that. We're going to give you something better.'""

""It's not about her, it's about the attitude out there -- the attitude that we know best, you do it my way.""

He added: ""I resent that. And I wasn't talking about her, I was talking about the attitude that if you don't agree with me, get in the other party.""

Connecting through grief

The strongest connections Biden makes on the campaign trail often come when opening up about the tragedies he has faced -- and hearing about the deep losses of others.

Asked what it meant to have people take comfort in sharing some of their deep personal tragedies with him, Biden said, ""Well, you know, I have -- a lot of people have suffered more than I have as loss, and I have been really -- sounds bizarre to say -- lucky in the sense that I had an incredible family.""

Biden's wife and infant daughter died in a car crash in 1972 and his sons were injured. His son, Beau, died of brain cancer four years ago.

He went on to explain how his family stepped up to help him raise his children.

""When you're the recipient of someone's understanding and empathy, you understand how it can help and it's just impossible, although sometimes it's hard to not share it with others. When people come up to me often, as you've observed, is they come up and they'll walk up to me and all of a sudden a man or woman will just grab me and hug me and say, 'I just lost my son, lost my daughter, tell me, am I going to be OK, am I going to be OK?' ""

Biden said the best way to overcome tragedy is to find purpose in life.

""Purpose. And a purpose is best utilized if it relates to something that related to what the person you lost cared about,"" he said.

He continued: ""There will come a time if anybody of you are going through it where the thought of the person you lost will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to be able to make it. That's when you know. But it's hard. It's hard. It gives me some -- it gives me some sense of purpose when I'm able to be of some help.""

Contradictory takes on the GOP

Biden repeated a belief he often expresses on the campaign trail: that Republicans will be more willing to work with Democrats if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.

But he also offered a contradictory example -- one that showed, as Biden's Democratic rivals have frequently pointed out, that GOP lawmakers refused to cooperate with Democrats well before Trump became the party's standard-bearer.

Biden pointed to then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in March 2016. Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a hearing.

""I called 12 Republicans and said, 'What are you doing?' "" Biden said. ""I said, 'You realize what you're doing to the Constitution?' They said, 'We know, Joe, but here's the deal: Joe, I'm in a state where if in fact the Koch brothers drop in $10, $12 million, I will lose the primary.' ""

Garland was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Trump was elected later that year.

Still, Biden said, ""I honest to God believe, with Trump out of the way, you're going to find people screwing up a lot more courage than they had before to say, 'OK, OK, I can move now, I have more leeway.'""

Biden didn't explain why, if Republicans had been unbending before Trump due to concerns that they'd anger their conservative base, they'd be more willing to work with Democrats after his departure.

That missing link is part of what Biden's opponents have used against him: As he argues for a return to pre-Trump normalcy, his Democratic rivals -- including Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who bemoans the ""old normal"" -- say that era wasn't working for progressives, either.

Not sweating impeachment politics

Biden expressed no worries about potential electoral backlash on Monday, saying that impeachment proceedings against Trump could help convince independents and Republicans to oppose the President.

Asked whether impeachment proceedings would help or hurt Democrats in the 2020 election, Biden answered that -- no matter the political outcome -- Trump's actions have left the House of Representatives with no choice but to proceed.

""The House has no option. It has to enforce the Constitution, whether or not -- whether or not -- it turns out to work or not work, or whether or not it turns out that he should or shouldn't be kicked out of office,"" he said.

Biden added that if Democrats make a strong case that Trump violated his oath of office, ""you're going to find that those areas that are independent and Republican areas saying, whoa, whoa, we got to do something, we got to do something.""

""That's going to change their view. Let's see where the facts lead us,"" Biden said. He added: ""My job is just to go beat him."""

(CNN) It's become the political buzzword over the past few years, increasingly used to describe the root cause of our divisions and our resentments: tribalism.

The idea that Americans are more divided than ever, entrenched in ideological camps and unwilling to meet in the middle, is so pervasive that one hardly goes a single hour without hearing about it on a cable news show.

Since 2016, numerous books by very smart people, including Jonah Goldberg, Amy Chua, Steve Kornacki, Stevan E. Hobfoll, Sarah Rose Cavanagh and others have been devoted to tracing, explaining or solving America's tribalism.

But is tribalism really to blame? It's more complicated than that. Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it's what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom.

What isn't natural, however, is the oversized importance we're increasingly putting on politics.

A popular exercise

Tribalism, of course, is a compelling argument, considering that we've reduced our political beliefs to untenable absolutisms, have sacrificed compromise and comity for purity and are subjecting each other to increasingly unproductive tests of loyalty.

We are more and more defined not by our friends but our political enemies — collecting them like badges of honor. It was actually a question at a 2015 Democratic debate: ""Which enemy are you most proud of?"" None of the five candidates batted an eyelash, eagerly rattling off their political hit lists. Hillary Clinton was practically giddy : ""Well, in addition to the NRA,"" she said, ""the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. Probably the Republicans.""

This election feels somehow even worse. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden has been harassed by people in his own party for complimenting Republican lawmakers, for seeming to be congenial, for vowing to work across the aisle if elected. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders insist if you're not as far to the left as they are, you're lacking intestinal fortitude.

And on the right, we all know how that goes. President Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that anyone not fully behind them is an enemy, and maybe isn't even an American — the latter of which Trump alluded to in a series of racist tweets targeting four women lawmakers of color.

That is tribalism by definition. But we can't throw it completely under the bus or out with the bathwater. After all, we literally can't live without it.

Forming communities — even and especially ones based on strong loyalties and allegiances — is in our DNA. It's what's kept us alive for millions of years.

As UCLA professor Matthew Lieberman wrote in his 2013 book , ""Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect,"" ""Mammals are more socially connected than reptiles, primates more than other mammals, and humans more than other primates. What this suggests is that becoming more socially connected is essential to our survival. In a sense, evolution has made bets at each step that the best way to make us more successful is to make us more social.""

Tribalism isn't just political

The need for community, to belong to something, is one important reason two very powerful communities have thrived: organized religion and professional sports.

Both communities are organized around intense allegiances, often with the explicit requirement that adherents reject and disavow competing entities. Few worshipers believe equally in the major tenets of Christianity and Judaism — that Jesus is both the Messiah and that he's not. Almost no baseball fans root equally for the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. That would be, well, sacrilegious.

The ""us vs. them"" structure demanded of many religious and sports faithful is not only accepted within those contexts, but it's used to justify some patently bad behavior, from taunting rivals and hooliganism at sports events, to bigotry, hate crimes and even wars in the name of religion.

The tribalism in both, however, has inarguably helped their success in creating vast global communities across generations and geography; becoming important agents of change in breaking down civil rights, race and gender boundaries; and providing purpose and a sense of family for billions of people.

The tribalism in today's politics is similarly double-edged. On the plus side, one could argue political engagement has benefited from an intensified political environment. 2018 was the first year that more than 100 million Americans voted in a midterm election, for example.

On the minus, it feels impossible to civilly discuss politics — or avoid it altogether — when tensions are so high. It infects every aspect of our culture, from award shows to football games , our favorite coffee and fast food . Political ""teams"" may build enthusiasm and loyalty, but they inherently pit American against American, citizen against immigrant, young against old, and so on. That, as we've seen, can lead some to vengeance and violence in defense of their political tribe.

It seems like politics has surpassed sports and organized religion as the most defining part of our identity. Our politics has become synonymous with our values and our organizing life principle. Instead, politics really should merely be a mechanism to govern.

It's not just tribalism in politics that's the problem — it's our outsized belief in its significance in our lives. We're spending more on political campaigns, moving to places where our political views are popular and, according to a new study in the American Journal of Political Science, our politics may even be overriding our morals. As Peter Hatemi, one of the study's authors, explains: ""We will switch our moral compass depending on how it fits with what we believe politically.""

Our obsession with the presidency

Partly to blame is our increasing obsession with the American presidency as an embodiment of hope and change, to borrow a phrase.

Long before former President Barack Obama was supposed to save the country from its many suffering ills, so too were Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush. These were merely men — politicians, at that — but onto each of them was foisted a heavy mantle of expectation that was never going to be fully realized.

The paternalism of the presidency was baked in from the get-go. George Washington recoiled at the notion of being called ""the father of his country"" in newspapers, and, as Thomas Fleming writes in "" The Intimate Lives of the Founding Fathers ,"" Washington did ""his utmost to avoid acknowledging this tendency to view him as a demigod."" But our view of the chief executive as a fatherly figure who is there to guide us and care for us only grew.

In conservative columnist George Will's weighty new book, "" The Conservative Sensibility ,"" he describes this as the ""infantilization of the public.""

He recalls a 1992 town hall-style debate featuring Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot, where an audience member asked, ""How can we, as symbolically the children of the future president, expect ... you to meet our needs, the needs in housing and in crime and you name it?""

The American president, it is believed, must solve all our problems, both complex and mundane. He or she must reflect to us our idealized best selves and represent all we hope to become as a nation over the next four years. Whether we seek a Republican or a Democrat, a strong man or a caretaker, a traditionalist or a progressive, we truly believe we can find and deserve the Aaron Sorkin version of a president — a leader who is omnipresent in our lives and reflective of our values.

Demystifying the persona of the presidency

In reality, the president has very little to do with our day-to-day challenges. The most influential people in our daily lives likely run our schools, our municipalities, our health, safety and sanitation boards. Most of us couldn't name any one of those people.

The election of President Donald Trump amped up our presidential cult of personality to 11. With no political record and a campaign of personal attacks and fear-mongering, Trump wasn't elected to ""do politics"" or solve problems, but to mirror to his supporters the image of a forgotten man and all his grievances.

How we unwind our long obsession with the presidency is complicated, and in some ways, like putting toothpaste back in the tube. But an essential part of deemphasizing the role of politics in our private lives is demystifying the persona of the president.

A pretty good year to be alive

Now, I know it might feel like we're at a crisis point in America — we are, among other things, contemplating impeaching our president. But while you might not know it from watching the news or reading the headlines, 2019 is a pretty good time to be alive.

By nearly every metric of human well-being, the world around us is a much better place than it was a century or two ago. As Max Roser, an Oxford University economist, writes in ""The Short History of Global Living Conditions and Why It Matters That We Know It,"" we're freer, more democratic, healthier, richer, better educated and more literate than we ever have been.

And yet, especially in high-income Western countries like the United States, we've never been more stressed or felt more anxious.

According to a recent survey , a scant 6% of people in the United States said things were getting better when asked, ""All things considered, do you think the world is getting better or worse?"" It's no wonder, under those conditions, that we've become more divided, angry at our neighbors and resentful of others.

Investing in our communities

But there's reason to believe change is possible. And it's important that we start looking inward, to our own communities. Over the past half-century, we dreamed big, looking outward to the horizons to expand our global opportunities and connectivity. That was a good thing, but in doing so we often ignored our own backyards. Instead of marching on Washington, imagine marching on your town square for smaller class rooms, cleaner water, less crime. Instead of tweeting about Trump or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, what about doing some community service or volunteer work. Instead of teaching our kids to parrot our political views, let's teach them civic engagement and how to make small differences in their own communities.

If our political identities are how we build our own individual community, how we weed out friends from foes, how we judge each other above all other things, the logical conclusion is an America that sees politics as religion, that justifies intolerance and exclusion as virtue and righteousness, that rationalizes patently bad behavior in the name of a cause.

We can continue to blame tribalism for our anger and division, but it's an important part of our evolutionary makeup and a survival skill we're not likely to ditch any time soon. The problem isn't that we're too tribal — it's that we've let politics replace community."

On the eve of the first public impeachment hearings, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a run to Arkansas on Tuesday to secure his spot on that state's Democratic primary ballot, should he decide to run. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick weighed a late entry to the race while facing down Friday's filing deadline in the key state of New Hampshire. And Hillary Clinton coyly suggested, once again, that she could leap from the sidelines.

Clearly enjoying the opportunity to taunt Trump at this vulnerable moment in his presidency -- and undoubtedly unnerving some current 2020 Democrats -- Clinton told BBC Radio that she was not running for president in 2020, but she left the door ajar.

""Never say never, and I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,"" Clinton told BBC radio in the midst of a publicity tour for her new book with her daughter, Chelsea. ""But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.""

In Clinton's case, teasing another White House bid was most likely a lighthearted way of drawing publicity for her new book. Last month, when Trump tweeted that ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" should run again to ""steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,"" the 2016 Democratic nominee playfully tweeted back : ""Don't tempt me. Do your job."" ( CNN reported in October that Clinton's admirers have tried to coax her off the sidelines, but she has repeatedly ruled out a run).

Still, the fact that Patrick and Bloomberg could soon join the field underscores how fractured Democrats are three months before the opening contest in Iowa.

The party still has not settled its long-running debate about whether to swing hard to the left by nominating a candidate like Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- both of whom have excited a younger generation of activists -- or embrace a more moderate candidate who could theoretically appeal to Republicans and independents disenchanted by Trump, as well as blue-collar voters who the party lost to Trump in 2016.

The latest polls in early-primary states demonstrate that lack of consensus among Democrats about who would be strongest against Trump, which has prompted much of the hand-wringing in recent months.

A new Monmouth University poll of likely caucusgoers out Tuesday showed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging to the top of the field with 22%, followed by Biden with 19%, Warren with 18% and Sanders at 13%. All four were within the margin of error -- meaning that none of them could claim front-runner status in the Hawkeye State. (Bloomberg registered at 1%).

Biden held a slender lead in New Hampshire in a new Quinnipiac University poll t his week with the support of 20% of likely voters in the state. Warren followed at 16%, Buttigieg at 15% and Sanders at 14%.

The glimmer of hope for Patrick and Bloomberg at this late stage is rooted in Democrats' uncertainty about Biden, who was perceived as a far stronger front-runner before he entered the race earlier this year. But both men are untested among the broader electorate.

The filing deadlines to get on key state ballots this week appear to have forced the hand of Bloomberg and Patrick, who could face a major disadvantage if they miss the chance to compete in all 50 states, particularly if the race devolves into a prolonged delegate fight.

Last week Bloomberg's team filed the paperwork needed to get on the primary ballot in Alabama. (Patrick missed the deadlines in Alabama and appears to have missed Arkansas').

Bloomberg's adviser Howard Wolfson told CNN in a statement last week that Bloomberg plans to skip the first four primary contests. ""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,"" Wolfson said.

On Tuesday in Arkansas, Bloomberg told a gaggle of reporters he was ""still exploring what we're going to do"" and deflected questions about Biden's strength as a candidate, calling him ""a very nice guy.""

""I've known him for a long time, and if you want to know about Joe Biden, you've got to talk to Joe Biden. He's running his campaign, I'm running mine and one thing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with another,"" Bloomberg told reporters.

""All I've got to do is -- if I run -- explain to people what I think is wrong with this country, and how I would fix it. And then the public can make a decision,"" the former New York mayor said.

""I've been more and more upset with what's going on here,"" he said. ""We don't talk to each other. We don't work together. There's a lack of honesty and civility. That is not good for our country, and I've got two daughters and two grandkids that I care about. And I'd like to do something about it, whether it's running for president or something else."""

(CNN) While much of the 2019 election discussion focused on the Kentucky and Mississippi gubernatorial contests and the Virginia state legislative races, there were pivotal countywide races in Pennsylvania that provide a much clearer view of the political realignment we have been slowly witnessing for many years in my home state.

Charlie Dent

The lesson learned from Pennsylvania, which went for Donald Trump in 2016, is the same as for the rest of the country. As a result of his election and performance in office, the suburbs are nearly completely gone for the Republican Party.

When I was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1990 from an Allentown-based district, Republicans performed very well in the suburbs and dominated rural areas. There were even a few Republicans like me who were winning elections in urban areas and even more Democrats who were successful in rural communities throughout the state and well beyond the Philadelphia region.

But things were slowly changing. In 1990, while I and two other Republicans were defeating entrenched Democratic state House incumbents in the Lehigh Valley, a perennial bellwether and swing region of eastern Pennsylvania, an almost unheard of young man and young woman defeated an entrenched Democratic congressman and Democratic state senator, respectively, from the other side of the state, in the Pittsburgh area. Their names: Rick Santorum and Melissa Hart.

Four years later Rick Santorum became a US senator, and ten years later Melissa Hart gained a seat in the US House of Representatives. These 1990 election results were shocking to the political class at that time. How did five Republicans defy political gravity to win Democratic districts in the midterm election during the Presidency of George H.W. Bush? This should not have happened, but what we were witnessing was an emerging trend.

Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed.

The Monmouth University poll, taken November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren’s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth’s previous poll.

No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three — Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:

Bennet 0%

Bloomberg 0%

Delaney 0%

Williamson 0%

Sestak 0% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) November 12, 2019

According to Monmouth, Buttigieg “has gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.”

Per Monmouth:

His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren). Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden’s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders). Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren).

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said, noting that the presidential hopeful’s support cannot be attributed to any one group.

“While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,” he continued. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent."

“I think you should ask him. For me, this is really talking about … all the little girls who came up just now and who’ve done pinky promises. … We’re here, we’re strong, and we have strong views,” Warren stated.

The beef between the two escalated after Warren unveiled her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan — a plan which she claims will not require a middle class tax hike. Biden’s Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield remarked on the “mathematical gymnastics” used in Warren’s proposal, and the Massachusetts senator suggested that Biden was guilty of using “Republican talking points.”

“Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don’t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,” she said.

Biden defended his position in a Medium post last week, noting that Warren’s attack reflects “an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,” although he did not mention her by name.

“The other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,” he wrote.

He continued:

But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn’t agree with you — it’s not just that you disagree — that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.

Warren subtly attributed Biden’s description — describing her as “angry” — to sexism.

“I am angry and I own it,” a Friday fundraising email from Warren read.

“Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,” it continued.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), started the war of words that has escalated between the two camps over Medicare for All.

Biden, who is one of the only 2020 Democrats to come out in opposition to the universal health care proposal, was asked during a televised CNN town hall in Iowa about criticisms he made regarding Warren’s “elitist” brand of politics. The former vice president made the remarks last week in a self-published Medium piece after Warren suggested he was running in the wrong presidential primary because he was unwilling to support Medicare for All.

“Let’s get something straight, she attacked me,” Biden said when asked about the dust up. “She went out and said…Biden is a coward, Biden is…and she went down the list of saying I should be in a Republican primary. What do you call that?”

The former vice president defended his decision to write the Medium piece, saying there was an “attitude that exists” in the country right now that “if you disagree with me, you must be bad.” Despite the pleas for civility and understanding, Biden proceeded to lambast Warren’s views and attitude as “elitist” and condescending once more. Although the moderator, CNN’s Erin Burnett, attempted to push back against Biden’s comments, what ended up being lost in the mix was that the former vice president had started the altercation over Medicare for All.

Earlier this month, Biden accused Warren of lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she would pay for it during an interview with “PBS News Hour.”

“She’s making it up,” the former vice president said when asked about cost estimates Warren’s campaign had released on the proposal. “Look, nobody thinks it’s $20 trillion. It’s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that’s gone out there, that’s taken a look at this, there is no way — even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can’t even meet the cost of it.”

Even prior to the interview, Biden’s campaign had been pressuring Warren for months to explain how she would cover the costs associated from Medicare for All, which some estimate could run upwards of $32 trillion, without raising taxes on the middle class. When the Massachusetts Democrats did finally answer that question with a detailed proposal, Biden’s campaign jumped to claim she was promising to raise taxes on middle class families, even though Warren expressly pledged in her plan there would be “no middle class tax increases.”

“For months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does,” Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president’s deputy campaign manger, said at the time. “Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.”

Warren, herself, responded to the attack while campaigning in Iowa by accusing the former vice president of “repeating Republican talking points” on Medicare for All to the benefit of insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry.

“If anyone wants to defend keeping those high profits for insurance companies…drug companies…and not making corporations pay a fair share in taxes,” the senator said, “then I think they’re running in the wrong presidential primary.”

Warren, in part, was echoing her progressive rival from Vermont, Sanders, with the attack. In July, Sanders had publicly accused Biden of parroting GOP talking points in an effort to undermine the credibility of Medicare for All.

“Obviously what Biden was doing is what the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries, Republicans, do: ignoring the fact that people will save money on their health care because they will no longer have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket expenses,” Sanders, who authored the initial Medicare for Al bill in 2017, told The New York Times over the summer.

Regardless if the rebuke had partially been used before, Warren’s suggestion that Biden should be running as a Republican sent the former vice president’s team spinning. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, even claimed Warren has no right to question his Democrat credentials since she herself was a Republican until the age of 47-years-old.

You have to be kidding me. Warren was a Republican until she was 47 years old while Joe Biden has spent his life helping elect Democrats across the country and served with honor in the Senate and with Pres Obama. https://t.co/E9CESedasL — Greg Schultz (@schultzohio) November 1, 2019

When that attack failed to get traction, Biden penned his Medium piece, accusing Warren of brandishing an “elitist” and “condescending” brand of politics that was eroding the national discourse. Although the former vice president never once mentioned Warren in the piece, his rigorous defense of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option left little to the imagination.

The flare-up between the two camps underscores the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as 32 percentage points at one point, his campaign has steadily declined in recent months.

Biden’s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren’s have only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin.

As the candidates standing in the 2020 field has reversed, with Warren being described as the frontrunner by even some of Biden’s former Obama administration colleagues, the former vice president has only escalated his criticism, as exhibited at the CNN town hall on Monday.

“I’m more of a Democrat from my shoe sole to my ears than about anybody running in this party,” Biden claimed, before clarifying that also included Warren."

“I total disagree with that. It’s ridiculous,” she said. “I’m the sage age as Joe Biden. Do I look like I don’t know what I’m doing?”

She added: “I don’t see it as an issue. I really don’t.”

Apatow replied: “You’re like a genetic mutation.”

The 40-Year-Old Virgin director has been a vehement critic of President Donald Trump, calling him a “sniveling lunatic” and a “Nazi supported by the Russians.”

Behar recently came under fire after she lost her cool when Donald Trump, Jr. appeared on The View last week and noted that Behar once dressed in blackface.

The host denied on air that she has ever donned blackface, despite previously admitting that she once dressed as a “beautiful African woman” for Halloween.

While mainstream media are reporting some polls that suggest Trump is losing the support of women, the report by Open Secrets, part of the Center for Responsive Politics, shows the president has over 10,500 large-dollar contributions from women in suburbs, and has received $8,293,135 from them – the largest amount than any of the Democrat 2020 candidates.

“Suburban women, who power a significant electoral battleground, are a key demographic for 2020,” wrote Grace Haley at the research group that tracks money in U.S. politics. “Since Trump’s inauguration, more than 7,000 women in suburban districts have given large-dollar contributions to his campaign. That totals $8 million, the most of all candidates.”

Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner, drew attention to the Open Secrets report.

He noted that 28 percent of Trump’s “itemized contributions” were from women in 2016.

“For the 2020 election, they are 35 [percent],” Bedard reported.

On paper, Trump ranks fifth in donations from women at $15.1 million, with the leader in donations from women reported from Sen. Bernie Sanders at $17.1 million, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who have all raised $15 million or more from women, Open Secrets reported.

However, the research group also observed that “Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million” since the Trump campaign does not report demographic information about its small donors:

Campaigns are not required to itemize donations of $200 or less, so we do not have demographic information about Trump’s small donors giving to his joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee, Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. An estimated 59 percent of Trump’s donations are from small-donors, so Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million. Trump’s totals are underestimated more than the other candidates. Because Democrats are relying on ActBlue and the Republicans are not relying on the Republican equivalent WinRed as significantly, we only have most (not all) donor demographic data for Democratic small-dollar donors.

Amy Kremer, chairwoman of Women for America First and co-founder and chair of Women for Trump PAC, told Breitbart News it is “no surprise that women are contributing to the president’s campaign” since many women in suburbs have families and children.

“Women are focused on issues that impact our children and our families and President Trump is delivering results,” she said, adding that when women contribute to his campaign “it’s an easy donation when you know what you are going to get in return and this president has followed through on his promises, and his policies have been good for women and their families.”

Open Secrets noted the Trump campaign says there are often more suburban women supporting the president than reported because “the polling data does not account for suburban women who favor Trump but do not feel comfortable publicly saying so.”

Kremer agreed with this statement.

“Not all women who support the President may be vocal about their support, but they are quietly doing their share to ensure another four years of America First with President Trump,” she said."

The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) It's become the political buzzword over the past few years, increasingly used to describe the root cause of our divisions and our resentments: tribalism.

The idea that Americans are more divided than ever, entrenched in ideological camps and unwilling to meet in the middle, is so pervasive that one hardly goes a single hour without hearing about it on a cable news show.

Since 2016, numerous books by very smart people, including Jonah Goldberg, Amy Chua, Steve Kornacki, Stevan E. Hobfoll, Sarah Rose Cavanagh and others have been devoted to tracing, explaining or solving America's tribalism.

But is tribalism really to blame? It's more complicated than that. Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it's what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom.

What isn't natural, however, is the oversized importance we're increasingly putting on politics.

A popular exercise

Tribalism, of course, is a compelling argument, considering that we've reduced our political beliefs to untenable absolutisms, have sacrificed compromise and comity for purity and are subjecting each other to increasingly unproductive tests of loyalty.

We are more and more defined not by our friends but our political enemies — collecting them like badges of honor. It was actually a question at a 2015 Democratic debate: ""Which enemy are you most proud of?"" None of the five candidates batted an eyelash, eagerly rattling off their political hit lists. Hillary Clinton was practically giddy : ""Well, in addition to the NRA,"" she said, ""the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. Probably the Republicans.""

This election feels somehow even worse. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden has been harassed by people in his own party for complimenting Republican lawmakers, for seeming to be congenial, for vowing to work across the aisle if elected. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders insist if you're not as far to the left as they are, you're lacking intestinal fortitude.

And on the right, we all know how that goes. President Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that anyone not fully behind them is an enemy, and maybe isn't even an American — the latter of which Trump alluded to in a series of racist tweets targeting four women lawmakers of color.

That is tribalism by definition. But we can't throw it completely under the bus or out with the bathwater. After all, we literally can't live without it.

Forming communities — even and especially ones based on strong loyalties and allegiances — is in our DNA. It's what's kept us alive for millions of years.

As UCLA professor Matthew Lieberman wrote in his 2013 book , ""Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect,"" ""Mammals are more socially connected than reptiles, primates more than other mammals, and humans more than other primates. What this suggests is that becoming more socially connected is essential to our survival. In a sense, evolution has made bets at each step that the best way to make us more successful is to make us more social.""

Tribalism isn't just political

The need for community, to belong to something, is one important reason two very powerful communities have thrived: organized religion and professional sports.

Both communities are organized around intense allegiances, often with the explicit requirement that adherents reject and disavow competing entities. Few worshipers believe equally in the major tenets of Christianity and Judaism — that Jesus is both the Messiah and that he's not. Almost no baseball fans root equally for the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. That would be, well, sacrilegious.

The ""us vs. them"" structure demanded of many religious and sports faithful is not only accepted within those contexts, but it's used to justify some patently bad behavior, from taunting rivals and hooliganism at sports events, to bigotry, hate crimes and even wars in the name of religion.

The tribalism in both, however, has inarguably helped their success in creating vast global communities across generations and geography; becoming important agents of change in breaking down civil rights, race and gender boundaries; and providing purpose and a sense of family for billions of people.

The tribalism in today's politics is similarly double-edged. On the plus side, one could argue political engagement has benefited from an intensified political environment. 2018 was the first year that more than 100 million Americans voted in a midterm election, for example.

On the minus, it feels impossible to civilly discuss politics — or avoid it altogether — when tensions are so high. It infects every aspect of our culture, from award shows to football games , our favorite coffee and fast food . Political ""teams"" may build enthusiasm and loyalty, but they inherently pit American against American, citizen against immigrant, young against old, and so on. That, as we've seen, can lead some to vengeance and violence in defense of their political tribe.

It seems like politics has surpassed sports and organized religion as the most defining part of our identity. Our politics has become synonymous with our values and our organizing life principle. Instead, politics really should merely be a mechanism to govern.

It's not just tribalism in politics that's the problem — it's our outsized belief in its significance in our lives. We're spending more on political campaigns, moving to places where our political views are popular and, according to a new study in the American Journal of Political Science, our politics may even be overriding our morals. As Peter Hatemi, one of the study's authors, explains: ""We will switch our moral compass depending on how it fits with what we believe politically.""

Our obsession with the presidency

Partly to blame is our increasing obsession with the American presidency as an embodiment of hope and change, to borrow a phrase.

Long before former President Barack Obama was supposed to save the country from its many suffering ills, so too were Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush. These were merely men — politicians, at that — but onto each of them was foisted a heavy mantle of expectation that was never going to be fully realized.

The paternalism of the presidency was baked in from the get-go. George Washington recoiled at the notion of being called ""the father of his country"" in newspapers, and, as Thomas Fleming writes in "" The Intimate Lives of the Founding Fathers ,"" Washington did ""his utmost to avoid acknowledging this tendency to view him as a demigod."" But our view of the chief executive as a fatherly figure who is there to guide us and care for us only grew.

In conservative columnist George Will's weighty new book, "" The Conservative Sensibility ,"" he describes this as the ""infantilization of the public.""

He recalls a 1992 town hall-style debate featuring Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot, where an audience member asked, ""How can we, as symbolically the children of the future president, expect ... you to meet our needs, the needs in housing and in crime and you name it?""

The American president, it is believed, must solve all our problems, both complex and mundane. He or she must reflect to us our idealized best selves and represent all we hope to become as a nation over the next four years. Whether we seek a Republican or a Democrat, a strong man or a caretaker, a traditionalist or a progressive, we truly believe we can find and deserve the Aaron Sorkin version of a president — a leader who is omnipresent in our lives and reflective of our values.

Demystifying the persona of the presidency

In reality, the president has very little to do with our day-to-day challenges. The most influential people in our daily lives likely run our schools, our municipalities, our health, safety and sanitation boards. Most of us couldn't name any one of those people.

The election of President Donald Trump amped up our presidential cult of personality to 11. With no political record and a campaign of personal attacks and fear-mongering, Trump wasn't elected to ""do politics"" or solve problems, but to mirror to his supporters the image of a forgotten man and all his grievances.

How we unwind our long obsession with the presidency is complicated, and in some ways, like putting toothpaste back in the tube. But an essential part of deemphasizing the role of politics in our private lives is demystifying the persona of the president.

A pretty good year to be alive

Now, I know it might feel like we're at a crisis point in America — we are, among other things, contemplating impeaching our president. But while you might not know it from watching the news or reading the headlines, 2019 is a pretty good time to be alive.

By nearly every metric of human well-being, the world around us is a much better place than it was a century or two ago. As Max Roser, an Oxford University economist, writes in ""The Short History of Global Living Conditions and Why It Matters That We Know It,"" we're freer, more democratic, healthier, richer, better educated and more literate than we ever have been.

And yet, especially in high-income Western countries like the United States, we've never been more stressed or felt more anxious.

According to a recent survey , a scant 6% of people in the United States said things were getting better when asked, ""All things considered, do you think the world is getting better or worse?"" It's no wonder, under those conditions, that we've become more divided, angry at our neighbors and resentful of others.

Investing in our communities

But there's reason to believe change is possible. And it's important that we start looking inward, to our own communities. Over the past half-century, we dreamed big, looking outward to the horizons to expand our global opportunities and connectivity. That was a good thing, but in doing so we often ignored our own backyards. Instead of marching on Washington, imagine marching on your town square for smaller class rooms, cleaner water, less crime. Instead of tweeting about Trump or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, what about doing some community service or volunteer work. Instead of teaching our kids to parrot our political views, let's teach them civic engagement and how to make small differences in their own communities.

If our political identities are how we build our own individual community, how we weed out friends from foes, how we judge each other above all other things, the logical conclusion is an America that sees politics as religion, that justifies intolerance and exclusion as virtue and righteousness, that rationalizes patently bad behavior in the name of a cause.

We can continue to blame tribalism for our anger and division, but it's an important part of our evolutionary makeup and a survival skill we're not likely to ditch any time soon. The problem isn't that we're too tribal — it's that we've let politics replace community."

On the eve of the first public impeachment hearings, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a run to Arkansas on Tuesday to secure his spot on that state's Democratic primary ballot, should he decide to run. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick weighed a late entry to the race while facing down Friday's filing deadline in the key state of New Hampshire. And Hillary Clinton coyly suggested, once again, that she could leap from the sidelines.

Clearly enjoying the opportunity to taunt Trump at this vulnerable moment in his presidency -- and undoubtedly unnerving some current 2020 Democrats -- Clinton told BBC Radio that she was not running for president in 2020, but she left the door ajar.

""Never say never, and I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,"" Clinton told BBC radio in the midst of a publicity tour for her new book with her daughter, Chelsea. ""But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.""

In Clinton's case, teasing another White House bid was most likely a lighthearted way of drawing publicity for her new book. Last month, when Trump tweeted that ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" should run again to ""steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,"" the 2016 Democratic nominee playfully tweeted back : ""Don't tempt me. Do your job."" ( CNN reported in October that Clinton's admirers have tried to coax her off the sidelines, but she has repeatedly ruled out a run).

Still, the fact that Patrick and Bloomberg could soon join the field underscores how fractured Democrats are three months before the opening contest in Iowa.

The party still has not settled its long-running debate about whether to swing hard to the left by nominating a candidate like Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- both of whom have excited a younger generation of activists -- or embrace a more moderate candidate who could theoretically appeal to Republicans and independents disenchanted by Trump, as well as blue-collar voters who the party lost to Trump in 2016.

The latest polls in early-primary states demonstrate that lack of consensus among Democrats about who would be strongest against Trump, which has prompted much of the hand-wringing in recent months.

A new Monmouth University poll of likely caucusgoers out Tuesday showed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging to the top of the field with 22%, followed by Biden with 19%, Warren with 18% and Sanders at 13%. All four were within the margin of error -- meaning that none of them could claim front-runner status in the Hawkeye State. (Bloomberg registered at 1%).

Biden held a slender lead in New Hampshire in a new Quinnipiac University poll t his week with the support of 20% of likely voters in the state. Warren followed at 16%, Buttigieg at 15% and Sanders at 14%.

The glimmer of hope for Patrick and Bloomberg at this late stage is rooted in Democrats' uncertainty about Biden, who was perceived as a far stronger front-runner before he entered the race earlier this year. But both men are untested among the broader electorate.

The filing deadlines to get on key state ballots this week appear to have forced the hand of Bloomberg and Patrick, who could face a major disadvantage if they miss the chance to compete in all 50 states, particularly if the race devolves into a prolonged delegate fight.

Last week Bloomberg's team filed the paperwork needed to get on the primary ballot in Alabama. (Patrick missed the deadlines in Alabama and appears to have missed Arkansas').

Bloomberg's adviser Howard Wolfson told CNN in a statement last week that Bloomberg plans to skip the first four primary contests. ""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,"" Wolfson said.

On Tuesday in Arkansas, Bloomberg told a gaggle of reporters he was ""still exploring what we're going to do"" and deflected questions about Biden's strength as a candidate, calling him ""a very nice guy.""

""I've known him for a long time, and if you want to know about Joe Biden, you've got to talk to Joe Biden. He's running his campaign, I'm running mine and one thing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with another,"" Bloomberg told reporters.

""All I've got to do is -- if I run -- explain to people what I think is wrong with this country, and how I would fix it. And then the public can make a decision,"" the former New York mayor said.

""I've been more and more upset with what's going on here,"" he said. ""We don't talk to each other. We don't work together. There's a lack of honesty and civility. That is not good for our country, and I've got two daughters and two grandkids that I care about. And I'd like to do something about it, whether it's running for president or something else."""

Heading into proceedings that will span at least 10 days, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff did his best to make the ""giant show,"" as one Wisconsin voter called it, play out like a serious courtroom procedural with time equally split between the two parties. But the undertone of anger from GOP leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes underscored that Americans are living in a political universe where no one seems to share the same version of the truth.

Trump supporter Kent Jeffers from Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, who was keeping an eye on the hearing during a trip to Phoenix, highlighted the depth of the Democratic challenge by pointing to the numbness many Americans feel after three consecutive years of investigations into President Donald Trump

""Mueller didn't get him,"" Jeffers said, referring to the investigation into Trump's dealings with Russia by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. ""Other people didn't get him. Now we need to find another narrative. I think everyone's numb to it. I think they're just done with it. It's kind of a joke now -- same thing over and over again. You're not going to change my mind with coming up with a new narrative to get him out of office.""

Boyce O'Brien of Phoenix, who voted GOP every election until Trump, lamented what he views as the lack of a moral compass among elected officials within the President's party -- and the likelihood that impeachment could just become another partisan exercise.

""Where are those Christian Republicans when it comes to integrity? They've ignored what this president has done,"" O'Brien said. ""This is another example of it. I hope this (the hearing) will turn the tide and hold him accountable. These hearings are hopefully a turning point for the country. Let's hope it goes to integrity, accountability, to the rule of law.""

It remains an open question whether the disclosures of the next 10 days -- and the public retelling of the story of how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival -- will move the needle of public opinion, which has recently stagnated on impeachment.

Some independents like David Cronin from Arizona -- where the party registration is a third Democrat, a third Republican and a third independent -- said he hoped the hearings would lay out the facts unfiltered.

""You have people on both sides who are not budging. Then you have people in the middle, like myself,"" Cronin said. ""I think they're important for the American people to see. It doesn't pass the sniff test,"" he added of the President's conduct. ""I say that as an independent, middle of the road, who could vote Democrat or Republican.""

In the critical swing state of New Hampshire, where independents compromise a large part of the electorate, some voters wondered how closely the American people would pay attention to a recitation of complex diplomatic dealings involving military aid to a foreign power.

""It's dry. No matter what you do to it, it's dry,"" said Ralph Mecheau from Bow, New Hampshire, who also tuned in to the Watergate hearings decades ago. ""It's point, counterpoint, point, counterpoint. I don't think it's going to change anybody's minds.""

""I think the guy, quite frankly, is treasonous,"" Mecheau said, referring to Trump. ""So nothing the opposition is going to say is going to change my mind on that.""

But he said he believed there were enough people throughout America who feel buyer's remorse with Trump to turn him out of office in 2020.

""Right here we have a real reformer,"" said Mecheau, who works for the state's liquor commission and is a union member, after attending an Elizabeth Warren event Wednesday night, adding, ""we have another one in Bernie"" Sanders.

""They are true reformers. You can see who their enemies are; you can see who the money is,"" Mecheau said, referring to the money behind their candidacies. ""Every time the money says they are going to put somebody in like (former New York Mayor Michael) Bloomberg ... basically they're giving me a harder endorsement on her or Bernie. We need people that are true reformers. That is what started to happen -- and people wanted in 2016. They just chose the wrong reformer.""

In another critical swing state -- Wisconsin -- Trump voters Randy and Terri Burl tuned in to the hearings even though they don't expect to their opinions to change much, if at all.

""It's just like a person who watches a soap opera. It's bad acting and all that,"" said Randy Burl who watched the hearings with his wife, who is the chair of the Forest County Wisconsin Republican Party.

Terri Burl said she is convinced that the President did nothing wrong. ""I want Trump to be Trump. If he started acting presidential tomorrow, and he started sounding like George W. Bush, I'd be like 'What happened?' Because he's going to say things that are true even if it hurts people's feelings.""

After watching several hours of the proceedings, Randy Burl, who is a less enthusiastic supporter of the President, told his wife he wasn't as convinced of Trump's innocence, but he was skeptical that impeachment would change many minds about the commander in chief.

""If he is found guilty or not guilty, or he's impeached or not, I just don't see it having a dramatic effect,"" Burl said. ""Most working people are never going to see these hearings. They're going to turn on their new show that supports whatever party they like and read their spin on it."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have demanded that Goldman Sachs reveal how its new Apple Card credit algorithm works following allegations of gender discrimination against women.

Business Insider reports that following recent allegations of gender bias, lawmakers are calling on Goldman Sachs to reveal the algorithm it uses to determine credit limits for its new Apple Card. The issue started on Thursday after entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson claimed that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit his wife received. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has stated that his wife experienced similar results.

The Apple Card was launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs which has claimed that applicants were evaluated independently according to income and creditworthiness, with factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt taken into account. The bank stated that it was possible for two family members to receive very different credit decisions but added: “We have not, and will not, make decisions based on factors like gender.”

Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren criticized Goldman Sachs in an interview with Bloomberg recently, stating: “Yeah, great, so let’s just tell every woman in America, ‘You might have been discriminated against, on an unknown algorithm, it’s on you to telephone Goldman Sachs and tell them to straighten it out. Sorry, guys, that’s not how it works.”

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) also tweeted that he would be investigating the allegations surrounding the Apple card, stating: “I’m investigating whether these allegations are true. If they are, I expect Apple and Goldman Sachs to do everything in their power to put an end to discrimination.”

I’m investigating whether these allegations are true. If they are, I expect Apple and Goldman Sachs to do everything in their power to put an end to discrimination. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) November 13, 2019

Breitbart News financial editor John Carney wrote an article about this issue recently, stating that it was unlikely that Apple or Goldman Sachs were discriminating based on gender. Carney wrote:

I hate to be the one who tells you this but Apple and Goldman do not care about you. They do not care about your hopes, your dreams, your philosophy, your politics, or your gender. They’ll use whatever pronouns you ask them to. We are all just future income streams to them. That’s it. Dollars divided by time. A discount rate, a probability of default, and a regulatory capital charge. Neither company has a particular interest in rationing credit, apart from some attempt to estimate the maximum credit they can provide and still get paid back at an acceptable rate. They do not really care if you, as an individual, wind up paying them back. They just want to get paid back at a rate that means making short-term consumer loans is slightly profitable enough to cover their cost of capital. They are constrained by regulations that penalize them for supplying what the government sees as too much credit to people whose lives might be ruined by over-indulgence in borrowing. Those include a myriad of rules from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, capital regulation from the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and state laws on credit. Think about it this way. If there were a team at Goldman Sachs who developed a computer program that gave too little credit to women, what are the odds that another team at Goldman wouldn’t have figured out how to make more money by providing the appropriate level of credit? Is everyone there too sexist to want to make money by lending appropriately to women customers?

Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, who has been busy on the campaign trail, told reporters on Wednesday that she will be there for an impeachment trial in the Senate if it comes to that point.

“I have constitutional responsibilities. I took an oath of office as did everyone in Congress, and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law,” she said.

“That includes the President of the United States, and if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial,” she added:

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) signaled on Monday that a trial in the Senate could last six to eight weeks:

Impeachment scheduling alert: Senate Intel Chairman Richard Burr says trial will last for ""6 to 8 weeks."" It will run for 6 days a week, from 12:30 to 6:30 p.m., a big chunk of time for senators also running for president hoping to be in IA, NH or anywhere but DC in Dec/Jan/Feb. — Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) November 12, 2019

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters this month that a trial in the Senate, at the time of his remarks, would not lead to Trump’s removal and noted the impact the trial could have on Democrat presidential hopefuls.

“I will say I’m pretty sure how it’s likely to end,” McConnell told reporters. “If it were today, I don’t think there’s any question — it would not lead to a removal.”

“So the question is how long does the Senate want to take? How long do the presidential candidates want to be here on the floor of the Senate instead of in Iowa and New Hampshire?” he asked.

Warren also made a few remarks prior to Wednesday’s hearing, claiming that the Mueller report “made it clear that Donald Trump repeatedly obstructed justice,” despite the fact that Mueller arrived at no such conclusion.

“Many reports have shown he is abusing diplomatic relationships for his own political gain. Now, it’s time for the public to see the evidence the House has gathered in these public hearings,” Warren tweeted.

“The American people deserve to know the truth,” she continued. “And it’s time to show Trump that no one is above the law—not even the president of the United States”:"

“I think that the instinct that his campaign seems to have…to project in effect, if we just get rid of the incumbent, we can go back to doing what we used to do, misses the moment,” Patrick told reporters after filing paperwork for the New Hampshire primary contest.

Patrick added:

The one truth in my opinion that candidate Trump spoke in 2016 was when he said that conventional or establishment politics isn’t working well enough for most people. Tha’s the same thing Sen. Sanders was saying and it’s the same thing Barack Obama said a decade and a half ago.

Patrick, who served as Massachusetts’s first African-American governor between 2007 and 2015, also issued praise for Biden, saying he is a “big, big fan” of the former vice president.

“I’ve known him for many years,” he said. “I think he is extraordinary public servant, frankly, whose deep, deep personal empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

Earlier Thursday, Patrick announced his presidential candidacy in a video shared to Twitter. He states in the announcement clip:

This time is about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader, as important as that is, but about delivering instead for you. This won’t be easy and it shouldn’t be. But I’m placing my faith in the people who feel left out and left back who just want a fair shot at a better future.

Patrick, regarded as a longshot candidate, joins a crowded primary field that includes Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and others."

Never before in the history of the modern presidential campaign have we seen such a thing.

The news former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has decided to pull the trigger on a late presidential run is nowhere near as interesting or consequential as the why behind his decision.

At this point, there are really only two people who could scramble the board: Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama. Patrick is waaaay behind in the crucial areas of fundraising and field organization, and has no national name recognition.

Nevertheless, Patrick, a popular two-term governor, has some things going for him. At 63, he’s younger than 77-year-old Biden (But who isn’t? — oh, yeah, Bernie Sanders.), he’s not disintegrating mentally and physically like Biden, he’s not a demented socialist like Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, he’s older than 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, and as a black man he can win those votes in South Carolina.

In other words, had he launched his campaign months ago, he might very well be the frontrunner today.

Granted, there are also some benefits to jumping in late. He’s a clean slate without any gaffes, and he knows what the competition is up to.

The deficits, however, are huge. On top of money and organizational issues, after leaving the governor’s office in 2015, he went to work for *shuts off lights, places flashlight under chin* BBBBAAAAAIN CAAAAAAPITAL.

You remember Bain Capital, the organization evil corporate raider Mitt Romney worked for, the organization Obama used to beat Romney senseless with during their 2012 presidential match, the organization that gives women cancer?

Yep, same Bain.

In a party openly embracing socialism, a party that turned the words “Bain” and “Capital” into the Boogeyman… Well, let’s just say Warren and Sanders are going to have a field day. And if the unexpected happens and Patrick does win the nomination, Trump will have countless clips of Obama and other high profile Democrats (not to mention the media) declaring Bain a disqualifier for the presidency.

Patrick’s late entry is a Hail Mary, but a calculated one… The question is, why?

Well, Patrick and Obama are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer.

But Patrick is getting in now, isn’t he? And it is more than fair to assume he’s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious…

As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren’s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay… But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn’t have the stuff.

To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He’s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running.

And then there’s Joe and his son Hunter looting China and Ukraine, the two countries Obama put Biden in charge of. Although Democrats and the media are frantically trying to cover for Biden with this stupid impeachment crusade, Trump’s numbers haven’t moved, while Quid Pro Joe’s have sunk.

Don’t forget Joe’s looting reflects on Obama, on his legacy, and if impeachment hits the Senate for a trial, Republicans are in charge over there, which means any trial that takes place will be a referendum on Joe and Hunter Biden just as Iowa and New Hampshire get ready to vote.

Obama is looking at his legacy, he is looking at the quality of a hapless Democrat field, and he is so concerned he just stabbed Biden, his ever-loyal vice president, right in the back, and is doing so with the biggest vote of “no confidence” a frontrunner ever received in modern presidential politics.

Sure, Patrick may swipe some New Hampshire voters from Warren and Bernie, but that’s unlikely. The Democrats who back Bernie and Warren are in love. No, Patrick’s beliefs align more closely with Biden, and the threat he represents is aimed right at Biden’s Achilles heel: the black vote that is just barely keeping Biden above water.

Heading into proceedings that will span at least 10 days, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff did his best to make the ""giant show,"" as one Wisconsin voter called it, play out like a serious courtroom procedural with time equally split between the two parties. But the undertone of anger from GOP leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes underscored that Americans are living in a political universe where no one seems to share the same version of the truth.

Trump supporter Kent Jeffers from Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, who was keeping an eye on the hearing during a trip to Phoenix, highlighted the depth of the Democratic challenge by pointing to the numbness many Americans feel after three consecutive years of investigations into President Donald Trump

""Mueller didn't get him,"" Jeffers said, referring to the investigation into Trump's dealings with Russia by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. ""Other people didn't get him. Now we need to find another narrative. I think everyone's numb to it. I think they're just done with it. It's kind of a joke now -- same thing over and over again. You're not going to change my mind with coming up with a new narrative to get him out of office.""

We need people that are true reformers. That is what started to happen -- and people wanted in 2016. They just chose the wrong reformer.""

In another critical swing state -- Wisconsin -- Trump voters Randy and Terri Burl tuned in to the hearings even though they don't expect to their opinions to change much, if at all.

""It's just like a person who watches a soap opera. It's bad acting and all that,"" said Randy Burl who watched the hearings with his wife, who is the chair of the Forest County Wisconsin Republican Party.

Terri Burl said she is convinced that the President did nothing wrong. ""I want Trump to be Trump. If he started acting presidential tomorrow, and he started sounding like George W. Bush, I'd be like 'What happened?' Because he's going to say things that are true even if it hurts people's feelings.""

After watching several hours of the proceedings, Randy Burl, who is a less enthusiastic supporter of the President, told his wife he wasn't as convinced of Trump's innocence, but he was skeptical that impeachment would change many minds about the commander in chief.

""If he is found guilty or not guilty, or he's impeached or not, I just don't see it having a dramatic effect,"" Burl said. ""Most working people are never going to see these hearings. They're going to turn on their new show that supports whatever party they like and read their spin on it."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have demanded that Goldman Sachs reveal how its new Apple Card credit algorithm works following allegations of gender discrimination against women.

Business Insider reports that following recent allegations of gender bias, lawmakers are calling on Goldman Sachs to reveal the algorithm it uses to determine credit limits for its new Apple Card. The issue started on Thursday after entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson claimed that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit his wife received. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has stated that his wife experienced similar results.

The Apple Card was launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs which has claimed that applicants were evaluated independently according to income and creditworthiness, with factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt taken into account. The bank stated that it was possible for two family members to receive very different credit decisions but added: “We have not, and will not, make decisions based on factors like gender.”

Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren criticized Goldman Sachs in an interview with Bloomberg recently, stating: “Yeah, great, so let’s just tell every woman in America, ‘You might have been discriminated against, on an unknown algorithm, it’s on you to telephone Goldman Sachs and tell them to straighten it out. Sorry, guys, that’s not how it works.”

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) also tweeted that he would be investigating the allegations surrounding the Apple card, stating: “I’m investigating whether these allegations are true. If they are, I expect Apple and Goldman Sachs to do everything in their power to put an end to discrimination.”

I’m investigating whether these allegations are true. If they are, I expect Apple and Goldman Sachs to do everything in their power to put an end to discrimination. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) November 13, 2019

Breitbart News financial editor John Carney wrote an article about this issue recently, stating that it was unlikely that Apple or Goldman Sachs were discriminating based on gender. Carney wrote:

I hate to be the one who tells you this but Apple and Goldman do not care about you. They do not care about your hopes, your dreams, your philosophy, your politics, or your gender. They’ll use whatever pronouns you ask them to. We are all just future income streams to them. That’s it. Dollars divided by time. A discount rate, a probability of default, and a regulatory capital charge. Neither company has a particular interest in rationing credit, apart from some attempt to estimate the maximum credit they can provide and still get paid back at an acceptable rate. They do not really care if you, as an individual, wind up paying them back. They just want to get paid back at a rate that means making short-term consumer loans is slightly profitable enough to cover their cost of capital. They are constrained by regulations that penalize them for supplying what the government sees as too much credit to people whose lives might be ruined by over-indulgence in borrowing. Those include a myriad of rules from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, capital regulation from the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and state laws on credit. Think about it this way. If there were a team at Goldman Sachs who developed a computer program that gave too little credit to women, what are the odds that another team at Goldman wouldn’t have figured out how to make more money by providing the appropriate level of credit? Is everyone there too sexist to want to make money by lending appropriately to women customers?

Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, who has been busy on the campaign trail, told reporters on Wednesday that she will be there for an impeachment trial in the Senate if it comes to that point.

“I have constitutional responsibilities. I took an oath of office as did everyone in Congress, and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law,” she said.

“That includes the President of the United States, and if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial,” she added:

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) signaled on Monday that a trial in the Senate could last six to eight weeks:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters this month that a trial in the Senate, at the time of his remarks, would not lead to Trump’s removal and noted the impact the trial could have on Democrat presidential hopefuls.

“I will say I’m pretty sure how it’s likely to end,” McConnell told reporters. “If it were today, I don’t think there’s any question — it would not lead to a removal.”

“So the question is how long does the Senate want to take? How long do the presidential candidates want to be here on the floor of the Senate instead of in Iowa and New Hampshire?” he asked.

Warren also made a few remarks prior to Wednesday’s hearing, claiming that the Mueller report “made it clear that Donald Trump repeatedly obstructed justice,” despite the fact that Mueller arrived at no such conclusion.

“Many reports have shown he is abusing diplomatic relationships for his own political gain. Now, it’s time for the public to see the evidence the House has gathered in these public hearings,” Warren tweeted.

“The American people deserve to know the truth,” she continued. “And it’s time to show Trump that no one is above the law—not even the president of the United States”:"

“I think that the instinct that his campaign seems to have…to project in effect, if we just get rid of the incumbent, we can go back to doing what we used to do, misses the moment,” Patrick told reporters after filing paperwork for the New Hampshire primary contest.

Patrick added:

The one truth in my opinion that candidate Trump spoke in 2016 was when he said that conventional or establishment politics isn’t working well enough for most people. Tha’s the same thing Sen. Sanders was saying and it’s the same thing Barack Obama said a decade and a half ago.

Patrick, who served as Massachusetts’s first African-American governor between 2007 and 2015, also issued praise for Biden, saying he is a “big, big fan” of the former vice president.

“I’ve known him for many years,” he said. “I think he is extraordinary public servant, frankly, whose deep, deep personal empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

Earlier Thursday, Patrick announced his presidential candidacy in a video shared to Twitter. He states in the announcement clip:

This time is about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader, as important as that is, but about delivering instead for you. This won’t be easy and it shouldn’t be. But I’m placing my faith in the people who feel left out and left back who just want a fair shot at a better future.

Patrick, regarded as a longshot candidate, joins a crowded primary field that includes Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and others."

Never before in the history of the modern presidential campaign have we seen such a thing.

The news former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has decided to pull the trigger on a late presidential run is nowhere near as interesting or consequential as the why behind his decision.

At this point, there are really only two people who could scramble the board: Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama. Patrick is waaaay behind in the crucial areas of fundraising and field organization, and has no national name recognition.

Nevertheless, Patrick, a popular two-term governor, has some things going for him. At 63, he’s younger than 77-year-old Biden (But who isn’t? — oh, yeah, Bernie Sanders.), he’s not disintegrating mentally and physically like Biden, he’s not a demented socialist like Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, he’s older than 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, and as a black man he can win those votes in South Carolina.

In other words, had he launched his campaign months ago, he might very well be the frontrunner today.

Granted, there are also some benefits to jumping in late. He’s a clean slate without any gaffes, and he knows what the competition is up to.

The deficits, however, are huge. On top of money and organizational issues, after leaving the governor’s office in 2015, he went to work for *shuts off lights, places flashlight under chin* BBBBAAAAAIN CAAAAAAPITAL.

You remember Bain Capital, the organization evil corporate raider Mitt Romney worked for, the organization Obama used to beat Romney senseless with during their 2012 presidential match, the organization that gives women cancer?

Yep, same Bain.

In a party openly embracing socialism, a party that turned the words “Bain” and “Capital” into the Boogeyman… Well, let’s just say Warren and Sanders are going to have a field day. And if the unexpected happens and Patrick does win the nomination, Trump will have countless clips of Obama and other high profile Democrats (not to mention the media) declaring Bain a disqualifier for the presidency.

Patrick’s late entry is a Hail Mary, but a calculated one… The question is, why?

Well, Patrick and Obama are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer.

But Patrick is getting in now, isn’t he? And it is more than fair to assume he’s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious…

As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren’s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay… But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn’t have the stuff.

To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He’s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running.

And then there’s Joe and his son Hunter looting China and Ukraine, the two countries Obama put Biden in charge of. Although Democrats and the media are frantically trying to cover for Biden with this stupid impeachment crusade, Trump’s numbers haven’t moved, while Quid Pro Joe’s have sunk.

Don’t forget Joe’s looting reflects on Obama, on his legacy, and if impeachment hits the Senate for a trial, Republicans are in charge over there, which means any trial that takes place will be a referendum on Joe and Hunter Biden just as Iowa and New Hampshire get ready to vote.

Obama is looking at his legacy, he is looking at the quality of a hapless Democrat field, and he is so concerned he just stabbed Biden, his ever-loyal vice president, right in the back, and is doing so with the biggest vote of “no confidence” a frontrunner ever received in modern presidential politics.

Sure, Patrick may swipe some New Hampshire voters from Warren and Bernie, but that’s unlikely. The Democrats who back Bernie and Warren are in love. No, Patrick’s beliefs align more closely with Biden, and the threat he represents is aimed right at Biden’s Achilles heel: the black vote that is just barely keeping Biden above water.

Obama said that some Democrats are listening too closely to liberal Twitter and progressive activists, specifically singling out issues like health care and immigration and, in what amounted to a stern warning to the 2020 field, bluntly said that voters are ""less revolutionary than ... interested in improvement"" and warned about turning off certain segments of the electorate by not being ""rooted in reality.""

""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

The former president specifically noted health care and immigration, saying people are ""rightly ... cautious"" on health care because ""they don't have a lot of margin for error.""

Obama's comments are particularly noteworthy because he rarely comments on the Democratic field, aside from -- as he did on Friday -- promising to ""work my tail off to make sure"" whoever wins the nomination defeats President Donald Trump.

Obama said his comments were not meant to be a ""criticism to the activist wing"" because those people should be pushing the party, but added that the ""candidates' job, whoever that ends up being, is to get elected"" and warned them from thinking that ""if you get so far out and you think automatically people will follow"" because you are being ""bold and creative.""

The former president's comments come at the same time that the party -- led by the large field of presidential hopefuls -- debates a host of sweeping policy proposals. These include ""Medicare for All,"" a liberal proposal to remake the country's health care system, the Green New Deal, a sizable plan aimed at combating climate change, and policies like decriminalizing border crossings into the United States and remaking the Supreme Court.

""This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think you have to completely tear down the system and remake it,"" he said. ""I think it is important for us not to lose sight of that.""

Obama also used the appearance to urge members of the Democratic Party to stop worrying so much about the turmoil and tumult within the Democratic race for president.

""For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,"" Obama said, nodding to his 2008 race against then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, which dragged on for months.

He added: ""I am confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate who has been tested and will be able to proudly carry the Democratic banner, and we are going to have to unify around that.""

The forum for the comment was not lost on those in the room: Obama offered his advice during an onstage interview with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at an event hosted by Democracy Alliance, a club of the party's top donors, the same group of people whose private and public worrying about the 2020 race has led some Democrats who had ruled out bids to consider getting back in.

The field of Democrats vying to take on Trump has grown in recent weeks, not shrunk, with former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launching a late-entry presidential campaign on Thursday.

Patrick, who jumped into the race out of fear over the state of the current crop of Democrats, has since subtly knocked his Democratic opponents, casting the race as one between ""nostalgia"" -- a nod to former Vice President Biden -- and the idea that ""it is our way, our big idea, or no way"" -- a nod to Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Democratic donors, watching Biden struggle to break out in the crowded field and liberals like Warren and Sanders pick up momentum, have been whispering for weeks that other Democrats should consider shaking up the race. Their key concern: None of the current candidates could defeat Trump if the election were today, despite polls that show otherwise.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also publicly weighing a run , after ruling it out earlier this year, because of concerns about Biden's ability to win the primary and go on to beat Trump.

Obama said Friday that debates within the party are good for the eventual nominee, and that losing states in 2008 had made him a better president.

""If Iowa showed that I could win the presidency, New Hampshire showed I could handle the presidency,"" he said, ""because when you are president you also experience losses and setbacks and things don't break your way.""

Obama's most stinging indictment of the party came during his warnings to its field of 2020 presidential candidates.

He showed that he was closely watching the Democratic race, especially how the candidates were debating his legacy and policies he had enacted during his eight years in the White House.

""Let people hear directly from me on this: I think it is important for candidates to push past what I was able to achieve as president. I wouldn't run the same campaign today in this environment that I ran in 2008, in part because we made enough progress since 2008, of which I am very proud, that it moved what is possible,"" he said. ""So I don't want people to just revert to what is safe. I want them to push on and try more.""

He added: ""So I don't take it as a criticism when people say, 'That is great, Obama did what he did and now we want to do more.' I hope so. That is the whole point. I built off the progress other people made. And tried to take the baton and run the race a little further, and then I expect people to take the baton from me and then I want them to run it a little further from that."""

Warren unveiled her Medicare for All plan in a Medium post this month, proclaiming, proudly, that the multitrillion-dollar plan would not require a tax hike on middle class Americans, even though experts state that it would. Rather, Warren claims she will pay for the plan, in part, via an additional tax hike on the wealthy, cuts on defense spending, and amnesty.

The presidential hopeful added to her plan on Friday, explaining how she would transition the country to a Medicare for All system. While she claims the transition would occur entirely in her first term, its enactment would occur under two legislative pushes. She describes the first as a “fast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that’s free for tens of millions”:

Today, I'm sharing my plan to transition to #MedicareForAll. In my first term, we will reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower drug prices, lower the Medicare age to 50 and create a true Medicare for All option—and fully transition to #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/ZErB1evhnC — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

Her plan states:

Coverage under the new Medicare for All option will be immediately free for children under the age of 18 and for families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (about $51,000 for a family of four). For all others, the cost will be modest, and eventually, coverage under this plan will be free for everyone.

Then, “no later” than her third year in office, Warren would “fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All,” essentially eliminating the need for private insurance:

By this point, the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company. Per the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn’t duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs.

Warren believes that the methodical, step by step approach will result in “millions” of Americans paying less in health care and claims they will see the “quality of their current health coverage improve.”

“And millions more Americans will have the choice to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality public plan,” her plan states, reiterating that it will not result in an increased tax burden for middle class families.

“And, at each step, the changes in our health care system will be fully paid for without raising taxes one penny on middle class families,” her plan claims.

“Let’s not kid ourselves: every Democratic plan for expanding public health care coverage is a challenge to these industries’ bottom lines – and every one of these plans is already being drowned in money to make sure it never happens,” Warren wrote, adding in a jab to two of her fiercest Democrat critics, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D).

“Any candidate who believes more modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention,” she warned.

Warren confirmed at a town hall meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, this month that her Medicare for All plan will also cover illegal immigrants.

“Medicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that’s it,” Warren told the crowd:"

More on the methodology:

The sample includes 958 Democrats, 848 Republicans, and 249 independents. Weighting was then employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample’s composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The precision of Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within ± 2.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Americans been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error. The poll also has a credibility interval ± 3.6 percentage points for Democrats, ± 3.8 percentage points for Republicans ± 7.1 percentage points for independents.

Bloomberg has not received a warm welcome from Democrats, particularly from Warren or Sanders. Most recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) took a veiled swipe at Bloomberg as well as other Democrats, who appear to be joining the race at the last minute.

Although a higher percentage of caucusgoers say their mind is made up (30%) now than in September (20%), 69% say they either don't have a first choice or could be persuaded to vote a different way.

There are seven candidates with favorable ratings over 50%.

When you look to history, leaders in Buttigieg's position have lost many times. In caucuses without an incumbent running, the leader in the Iowa polls at this point have only gone on to win the caucuses three of the last nine times since 2000. That means they have lost more often than they have won.

This is especially the case when the leader was polling below 49% like Buttigieg is currently. In each of these six cases, the Iowa polling leader at this point since 2000 went on to lose the caucuses -- and they went on to lose the nomination as well.

Now, that doesn't mean Buttigieg is destined to lose or anything like that. Rather, it's an indication that a lead at this point doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot when there are a slew of well-liked candidates not too far behind."

5. Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment: The steady drumbeat of the 2020 campaign isn't coming from Iowa or New Hampshire. It's coming from Washington and, specifically, Capitol Hill, where the second week of public impeachment hearings is packed with potential problems for President Donald Trump.

There are five hearings featuring eight total witnesses scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- a massive increase from the three witnesses over two hearings last week.

The two big(gest) ones to watch:

*National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman, who was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and has testified behind closed doors that he believed the conversation was inappropriate and immediately alerted his superior to that fact. Vindman will testify publicly Tuesday morning.

*Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify Wednesday morning in what will be the most-watched (and potentially most consequential) of the week's testimony. Sondland has been identified as taking a call with Trump on July 26 to convey that the Ukrainians were ready to announce an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Sondland also revised his original closed-door testimony to note that he had, in early September, told a top Ukrainian official that the hold-up of nearly $400 million in US military aid was directly due to the lack of an announcement of a Biden investigation. (There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.)

If this week on the impeachment front is as bad as last week -- and there is every indication it will be -- Trump will be in a world of hurt.

4. Kamala's collapse continues: The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new CNN/Des Moines Register pol l, it isn't working; Harris is at 3% with a bunch of other longer-shot candidates.)

That external turmoil is reportedly mirrored by internal fighting, with fingers being pointed at Harris' campaign manager, according to terrific reporting by Politico's Christopher Cadelago . Cadelago writes in a devastating piece on Harris' campaign:

""As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez.""

Having seen a lot of presidential candidacies over my time covering this stuff (aka I am old), I can say unequivocally that this is how campaigns end. Money problems, poll problems and, finally, the blame game. Harris has already qualified for this week's debate (much more on that below) and the next debate in December, but I'm skeptical she can hold on for another week with this current trajectory.

3. Trump's health questions: On Saturday, President Trump made an On Saturday, President Trump made an unscheduled and unannounced visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to undergo a ""quick exam and labs"" that was, according to the White House, part of his annual physical. ""Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, DC, to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed,"" explained White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.

Trump echoed that sentiment in a tweet Sunday morning , casting the visit as ""phase one of my yearly physical"" and pronouncing that ""everything very good (great!).""

But given a) the unscheduled nature of the trip b) the fact that his two previous yearly physical exams were on his official calendar and announced to the media and c) the fact that Trump is 73, it seems as though more questions will (and should) be asked about what exactly happened on Saturday.

All of those questions -- why was it an unannounced visit, why did he start his physical less than a year after his last one, etc. -- may well be easily answered to everyone's satisfaction. But given the way Trump obfuscated about his health as a candidate -- Dr. Harold Bornstein, anyone? -- they are questions that should be answered by this White House.

And then there is the fact that Trump -- in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton and again in 2020 targeting potential rival Joe Biden -- has sought to raise questions about his opponents' mental and physical heath. To insufficiently answer questions about his own health would seem to be, in a word, hypocritical.

2. A new Iowa front-runner: It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll proves just how much momentum the man they call Mayor Pete has.

Buttigieg has a 9-point lead over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a 10-point edge over both Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Which is remarkable given that Buttigieg was entirely unknown in the state as recently as a year ago.

What's more remarkable -- and more worrisome for Buttigieg's rivals -- is the trend line in Iowa for the mayor. Buttigieg is up 16 percentage points since a September CNN/DMR poll while both Warren (down 6 points) and Biden (down 5 points) lost support over that time. (Sanders gained 4 points from September to today.)

And Buttigieg's approval numbers suggest he will be difficult to topple in the remaining months before the Iowa caucuses. Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) have a favorable view of Mayor Pete while just 16% have an unfavorable one. That's both the highest favorable number and the lowest unfavorable number in the field. Plus, the 42% who said they feel ""very"" favorably toward Buttigieg is rivaled only by the 36% who say the same of Warren.

1. It's starting to get late in the debates: On Wednesday in Atlanta, 10 Democratic candidates will take the stage at Tyler Perry Studios. For eight of them, it will be their fifth debate of the primary season. For one -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- it will be her fourth. (Gabbard did not qualify for the August debate.) And for billionaire Tom Steyer, it will be his second (straight) debate -- after a late entry in the field causes him to miss the first three set-to's.

While more debates remain before the first vote in Iowa, this week's debate feels like the last best chance for the second-tier (and below) candidates to begin building the momentum they need to seriously challenge for the nomination.

Case in point: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She is at 6% in the most recent CNN/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa -- behind the front-running four but above the low single-digit crowd. Klobuchar has been solid in the debates to date but has struggled to build momentum coming off of her above-average performances. She's running out of time -- and needs to find a way to distinguish herself (and turn that into votes) in this debate.

No matter what happens, Klobuchar will have another debate in December. (She is one of six candidates who have already qualified for the Los Angeles debate.) Which makes the stakes for her high but not as high as the four candidates on stage Wednesday who haven't qualified for next month's debate yet : New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and technologist Andrew Yang as well as Steyer and Gabbard.

Booker may be in the most tenuous place of those four, as the New Jersey Democrat entered the 2020 race with high expectations that he simply has not met. Unless Booker has a standout performance Wednesday, he may well miss the next debate. And if someone of his stature is missing a debate two months before thew actual vote, it's hard to justify staying in the race."

Obama said that some Democrats are listening too closely to liberal Twitter and progressive activists, specifically singling out issues like health care and immigration and, in what amounted to a stern warning to the 2020 field, bluntly said that voters are ""less revolutionary than ... interested in improvement"" and warned about turning off certain segments of the electorate by not being ""rooted in reality.""

""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

The former president specifically noted health care and immigration, saying people are ""rightly ... cautious"" on health care because ""they don't have a lot of margin for error.""

Obama's comments are particularly noteworthy because he rarely comments on the Democratic field, aside from -- as he did on Friday -- promising to ""work my tail off to make sure"" whoever wins the nomination defeats President Donald Trump.

Obama said his comments were not meant to be a ""criticism to the activist wing"" because those people should be pushing the party, but added that the ""candidates' job, whoever that ends up being, is to get elected"" and warned them from thinking that ""if you get so far out and you think automatically people will follow"" because you are being ""bold and creative.""

The former president's comments come at the same time that the party -- led by the large field of presidential hopefuls -- debates a host of sweeping policy proposals. These include ""Medicare for All,"" a liberal proposal to remake the country's health care system, the Green New Deal, a sizable plan aimed at combating climate change, and policies like decriminalizing border crossings into the United States and remaking the Supreme Court.

""This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think you have to completely tear down the system and remake it,"" he said. ""I think it is important for us not to lose sight of that.""

Obama also used the appearance to urge members of the Democratic Party to stop worrying so much about the turmoil and tumult within the Democratic race for president.

""For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,"" Obama said, nodding to his 2008 race against then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, which dragged on for months.

He added: ""I am confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate who has been tested and will be able to proudly carry the Democratic banner, and we are going to have to unify around that.""

The forum for the comment was not lost on those in the room: Obama offered his advice during an onstage interview with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at an event hosted by Democracy Alliance, a club of the party's top donors, the same group of people whose private and public worrying about the 2020 race has led some Democrats who had ruled out bids to consider getting back in.

The field of Democrats vying to take on Trump has grown in recent weeks, not shrunk, with former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launching a late-entry presidential campaign on Thursday.

Patrick, who jumped into the race out of fear over the state of the current crop of Democrats, has since subtly knocked his Democratic opponents, casting the race as one between ""nostalgia"" -- a nod to former Vice President Biden -- and the idea that ""it is our way, our big idea, or no way"" -- a nod to Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Democratic donors, watching Biden struggle to break out in the crowded field and liberals like Warren and Sanders pick up momentum, have been whispering for weeks that other Democrats should consider shaking up the race. Their key concern: None of the current candidates could defeat Trump if the election were today, despite polls that show otherwise.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also publicly weighing a run , after ruling it out earlier this year, because of concerns about Biden's ability to win the primary and go on to beat Trump.

Obama said Friday that debates within the party are good for the eventual nominee, and that losing states in 2008 had made him a better president.

""If Iowa showed that I could win the presidency, New Hampshire showed I could handle the presidency,"" he said, ""because when you are president you also experience losses and setbacks and things don't break your way.""

Obama's most stinging indictment of the party came during his warnings to its field of 2020 presidential candidates.

He showed that he was closely watching the Democratic race, especially how the candidates were debating his legacy and policies he had enacted during his eight years in the White House.

""Let people hear directly from me on this: I think it is important for candidates to push past what I was able to achieve as president. I wouldn't run the same campaign today in this environment that I ran in 2008, in part because we made enough progress since 2008, of which I am very proud, that it moved what is possible,"" he said. ""So I don't want people to just revert to what is safe. I want them to push on and try more.""

He added: ""So I don't take it as a criticism when people say, 'That is great, Obama did what he did and now we want to do more.' I hope so. That is the whole point. I built off the progress other people made. And tried to take the baton and run the race a little further, and then I expect people to take the baton from me and then I want them to run it a little further from that."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday released her plan to transition the United States to her $52 trillion Medicare for All program, notably holding off on ending private insurance right off the bat and making it part of her second legislative push, which she claims will occur before the end of her first term.

Warren unveiled her Medicare for All plan in a Medium post this month, proclaiming, proudly, that the multitrillion-dollar plan would not require a tax hike on middle class Americans, even though experts state that it would. Rather, Warren claims she will pay for the plan, in part, via an additional tax hike on the wealthy, cuts on defense spending, and amnesty.

The presidential hopeful added to her plan on Friday, explaining how she would transition the country to a Medicare for All system. While she claims the transition would occur entirely in her first term, its enactment would occur under two legislative pushes. She describes the first as a “fast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that’s free for tens of millions”:

Today, I'm sharing my plan to transition to #MedicareForAll. In my first term, we will reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower drug prices, lower the Medicare age to 50 and create a true Medicare for All option—and fully transition to #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/ZErB1evhnC — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

Her plan states:

Coverage under the new Medicare for All option will be immediately free for children under the age of 18 and for families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (about $51,000 for a family of four). For all others, the cost will be modest, and eventually, coverage under this plan will be free for everyone.

Then, “no later” than her third year in office, Warren would “fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All,” essentially eliminating the need for private insurance:

By this point, the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company. Per the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn’t duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs.

Warren believes that the methodical, step by step approach will result in “millions” of Americans paying less in health care and claims they will see the “quality of their current health coverage improve.”

“And millions more Americans will have the choice to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality public plan,” her plan states, reiterating that it will not result in an increased tax burden for middle class families.

“And, at each step, the changes in our health care system will be fully paid for without raising taxes one penny on middle class families,” her plan claims.

“Let’s not kid ourselves: every Democratic plan for expanding public health care coverage is a challenge to these industries’ bottom lines – and every one of these plans is already being drowned in money to make sure it never happens,” Warren wrote, adding in a jab to two of her fiercest Democrat critics, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D).

“Any candidate who believes more modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention,” she warned.

Warren confirmed at a town hall meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, this month that her Medicare for All plan will also cover illegal immigrants.

“Medicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that’s it,” Warren told the crowd:"

More on the methodology:

The sample includes 958 Democrats, 848 Republicans, and 249 independents. Weighting was then employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample’s composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The precision of Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within ± 2.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Americans been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error. The poll also has a credibility interval ± 3.6 percentage points for Democrats, ± 3.8 percentage points for Republicans ± 7.1 percentage points for independents.

Bloomberg has not received a warm welcome from Democrats, particularly from Warren or Sanders. Most recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) took a veiled swipe at Bloomberg as well as other Democrats, who appear to be joining the race at the last minute.

A partial transcript is as follows:

MICHAEL SMERCONISH: Governor, what do you think? Are we headed to a brokered convention?

BILL RICHARDSON: I believe we are headed toward a brokered convention for the following reason. There’s a total of 4,600 delegates that are out there, 3,800 are pledged. But these superdelegates, 785, could be the margin of victory. They can’t vote until after the second ballot. But If you look at the top tier, Mayor Pete, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and potentially two formidable candidates in Bloomberg and Patrick coming in, they’re all bunched up around 20 percent or a little lower. And you need 1,918 to get a first-ballot victory. I don’t see any way that’s going to happen, Michael. So I think we’re going into a brokered convention. The new rules from the Democratic National Committee point to a brokered convention in the second and third ballot, where everybody’s free after the second ballot, third ballot. Potentially, some new candidates might emerge that perhaps didn’t enter the primary like Michelle Obama.

SMERCONISH: Woah, you’re making news here. Do you really think that’s a possibility that she would get in?

RICHARDSON: I think the delegates would want somebody that can win. There’s desperation for victory. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Michelle Obama, somebody like that. Possibly Tom Hanks, the actor. I know that’s a little farfetched. But, Democrats right now, there could be a very divided brokered convention where everybody is mad at each other and then somebody new emerges. That’s a possibility."

The Douglass Plan, named for the (Republican) former slave and abolitionist, proposes a variety of policies aimed at helping black Americans, alongside a committee to study the issue of reparations, which Buttigieg also backs.

The plan is partly aimed at addressing Buttigieg’s persistent weakness among black voters, which is partly the result of difficulties in his relationship with the black community in South Bend. He fired the city’s first black police chief, then faced criticism from the black community after an officer-involved shooting earlier this year. When he tried to make amends by accusing the police department of racism, he faced criticism from law enforcement as well.

As The Intercept reported Friday (original links):

When pressed on the lack of black support, Buttigieg and his campaign have made repeated references to the Douglass Plan, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass. “Our response to those who ask what our agenda for black America is, is the Douglass Plan.” Buttigieg said recently on CNN. “It is the most comprehensive vision put forward by a 2020 candidate on the question of how we’re going to tackle systemic racism in this country.” … The campaign hasn’t publicly claimed that every supporter of the plan listed is African American, though it wouldn’t be hard to draw that implication: It was published in the HBCU Times, and the bylines and top-listed supporters are all black. To be sure, a multiracial coalition would be needed to push the Douglass Plan through Congress, but the campaign didn’t say that, either. After publication, the Buttigieg campaign said it had sent the plan to the list of supporters and asked them to opt out if they did not want their name included on the list. That email also specified that the list was meant to represent “over 400 Black South Carolinians.”

In an email sent by the campaign, Buttigieg touted support from 400 black South Carolinians, according to Slate.

But as The Intercept reported, not all of those who signed on were black — and not all who signed on were aware that they had. Three of the signatories, one of whom has already endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), were shocked to see that the Buttigieg campaign was touting their support when they had not, in fact, backed the plan.

Moreover:

Whatever the intent, a review of the 422 names on the list of supporters finds that at least 297 of them appear in the South Carolina voter file. … But for 184 of them, the voter file lists either one name, or lists multiple people, all of whom self-identify as white — so at least 42 percent of the entire list is white. And that means 62 percent of the 297 names that can be reliably checked are white.

Other names, the Intercept reported, are repeated, or are from outside the U.S.

Slate published the Buttigieg campaign’s response to the story, claiming it never meant to mislead anyone — but revealing that it had used an “opt-out” process, rather than specifically asking “supporters” to opt into the plan:

In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren’t comfortable being listed and we removed them.

Moreover, according to the Intercept’s Ryan Grim, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan:

The latest poll in South Carolina has Buttigieg in a distant fourth place, at 8%, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads the field with 45%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at 17% and Sanders at 15%.

(CNN) The American political debate over health care is absurd. Americans pay twice as much as any other nation for health care, and then are told daily that they ""can't afford"" to switch to a lower-cost system very similar to those of Canada and Europe. If President Donald Trump and the plutocratic Republican party were the only ones carrying this ridiculous message, it would be understandable. Yet this message is also coming from media pundits aligned with the Democratic Party and the most conservative wing of the party.

Let's be clear on the central point. Medicare for All, as first proposed by Bernie Sanders and endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, is affordable precisely because it is cheaper , much cheaper, than the current system.

America's health care system relies on local monopolies (such as a health care provider centered at the sole major hospital in a city) and national monopolies, notably pharmaceutical companies holding exclusive patents.

In other countries, the government sets delivery prices and typically pays the health bills through the budget. In the US, the monopolists set the prices.

The sky-high revenues end up as huge corporate profits, wasteful administrative costs, useless and even harmful advertising and lavish salaries. Health care CEOs are making gargantuan salaries , many exceeding $10 million per year.

Who loses? Almost all Americans, whose insurance costs and out-of-pocket outlays inevitably lead to lower income because of unaffordable health care costs, untreated chronic illnesses, premature mortality and personal bankruptcies. Single-payer systems such as in Canada and Europe are cheaper, fairer and have better outcomes.

A recent international comparison of the performance of 11 national health systems on five main dimensions (care process, access, efficiency, equity and health care outcomes) ranked the US health system dead last.

Despite all of this, the US pundits profess to be alarmed about the prospect of Medicare for All. There has been a wave of op-eds and columns published (for example, here and here and here ) declaring that Medicare for All would lead to massive tax increases, and that Sanders' and Warren's support for Medicare for All threatens to reelect Trump. It's ridiculous.

Both Sanders and Warren poll well against Trump, ahead in the overall popular vote (though like all Democrats, facing headwinds of the Electoral College).

And at this stage of a national campaign, the goal should be to explain to voters the vast benefits of a single-payer system rather than to prejudge the politics based on self-fulfilling fearmongering.

Yes, one way or another, taxes would rise with Medicare for All, but private health outlays would go down by much more. Total health costs would fall.

That idea is not so hard to understand.

One influential pundit, economist Paul Krugman, has come around . In the 2016 election cycle, Krugman railed against Medicare for All. Yet after Warren laid out her proposal, Krugman supported Medicare for All. In truth, he was simply returning to the economically sound observations that he had long made before 2016.

The pundits seem to believe that Americans will rebel at ""higher taxes."" Actually, Americans are much smarter than that. They know that their current private health care payments, whether insurance premiums or out-of-pocket, are nothing other than ""taxes"" they pay to stay alive. They'll agree to pay higher taxes to the government if those new taxes eliminate larger private health care bills -- again, there are ""taxes"" by any other name -- that they now pay.

Some mainstream pundits are simply repeating what they hear from Democratic Party conservatives and centrists, the wing that has been dominant since Clinton's election in 1992. They are following the lead of Nancy Pelosi, Pete Buttigieg and others who are trashing Medicare for All.

What in the world are these leading Democratic Party politicians doing in opposing the transition to a fairer, more efficient and lower cost health care system? I would suggest it's not a lack of understanding. It's the power of campaign financing. These Democrats are funded by the status quo. The health sector contributed $265 million to federal campaigns in 2018, of which 56% went to Democrats. The sector spends nearly $500 million per year on lobbying. Money talks. Meanwhile, Americans go bankrupt or die early.

There remains the issue of the best way to raise budget revenues for Medicare for All. The basic answer is to use progressive taxation to fund the program. In this way, the nation as a whole will pay much less for health care and the vast majority of households will as well. The highest income households will end up paying a bit more because their funds will not only finance their own health care but will help to pay the health care costs of the poorest households as well.

Sanders rightly proposed a menu of options to pay for Medicare for All, including payroll and income taxation. Warren has proposed one specific approach: progressive taxes on the super-rich and the corporate sector but also a surprisingly regressive ""head tax"" on companies. She took great pride in not charging a penny of new income or payroll taxes on middle class households. But the proposed head tax on companies would hit wages indirectly and regressively.

Still, both Sanders' and Warrens' approaches would result in a more equitable and less expensive system. For most households, overall health care costs will decline.

The most worrisome thing about Warren's statement as she introduced her Medicare for All plan, is her emphasis on ""not one penny"" of new middle-class taxes. Here we go again. The Democrats have, for far too long, copied the Republican mantra about ""no new taxes,"" even as our public debt soars, our infrastructure and public services collapse and inequality reaches stratospheric dimensions.

To honor the silly stricture of ""no new taxes"" directly paid by middle-class households, Warren ended up endorsing a regressive head tax paid by the employer, which would end up hitting lower-wage workers even though its paid by their employers.

Let's hope this blunder is a one-time stumble for Warren. Most importantly, both Sanders and Warren are pointing the correct way to reform America's costly, unfair and inefficient health care system. And this is a goal that most Americans support."

And given his poor fundraising through the end of September and his, uh, middling debate performances, there are some real facts behind that perception.

But one of the under-told storylines of the 2020 campaign to date is that despite the defeatist conventional wisdom, the support for the former vice president has -- and continues -- to show surprising resilience. That's especially true of Biden's support among African Americans, a critical voting bloc in a Democratic presidential primary.

Two polls released Monday out of South Carolina tell that story. In a Quinnipiac University poll , Biden is at 33% with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a distant second at 13%. A University of North Florida poll showed much the same -- Biden at 36% with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lagging well behind at 10% each.

Among black voters in the Quinnipiac poll, Biden took 44% to 10% for Sanders and just 8% for Warren. (South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg received less than 1% of the black vote in South Carolina in the new Q poll. Ouch.)

Of the UNF poll, Dr. Michael Binder, faculty director of the Public Opinion Research Lab, said : ""Buoyed by his support among African American voters, Biden has an established lead far above the other contenders in South Carolina.""

There are seven candidates with favorable ratings over 50%.

When you look to history, leaders in Buttigieg's position have lost many times. In caucuses without an incumbent running, the leader in the Iowa polls at this point have only gone on to win the caucuses three of the last nine times since 2000. That means they have lost more often than they have won.

This is especially the case when the leader was polling below 49% like Buttigieg is currently. In each of these six cases, the Iowa polling leader at this point since 2000 went on to lose the caucuses -- and they went on to lose the nomination as well.

Now, that doesn't mean Buttigieg is destined to lose or anything like that. Rather, it's an indication that a lead at this point doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot when there are a slew of well-liked candidates not too far behind."

(CNN) Less than 10 days after six children and three women of a US family of were killed in Mexico, drawing national and international alarm, the Trump administration indicated it would move forward with a dangerous policy change that would make the types of weapons most likely used in that tragedy easier to export. The move seemingly skirts Congress and is counter to the apparent will of the American public. The change is tone deaf to today's needs and must be stopped.

Jeff Abramson

Found at the site of the brutal killings of members of the LeBaron family November 4 were more than 200 shell casings , according to Mexican officials, used primarily in AR-15-type assault rifles, weapons of choice of Mexican cartels. Recognizing the dangers these weapons can pose in fueling and extending conflicts around the globe, their export has for decades been regulated under a list of US military goods maintained by the State Department.

In 2002, Congress, understanding that it also needed to better oversee the export of these weapons, lowered the threshold of when it must be notified of potential sales to just $1 million, as opposed to $14 million for other major weapons. And, after decades of mass shootings here in the United States, a majority of the US public now simply favors banning them domestically.

Yet, just days after the massacre, the Trump administration quietly let Congress know that it would move ahead with controversial revisions that it proposed to US export laws by transferring oversight of semi-automatic firearms and their ammunition to a Commerce-controlled list. There, business concerns are more highly valued and Congress would no longer be informed of pending sales.

The change in export oversight has been in the works for years, but as I testified in March at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing, it is misguided and dangerous, based on the false assessment that because these weapons are less sophisticated they no longer deserve our highest attention.

5. Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment: The steady drumbeat of the 2020 campaign isn't coming from Iowa or New Hampshire. It's coming from Washington and, specifically, Capitol Hill, where the second week of public impeachment hearings is packed with potential problems for President Donald Trump.

There are five hearings featuring eight total witnesses scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- a massive increase from the three witnesses over two hearings last week.

The two big(gest) ones to watch:

*National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman, who was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and has testified behind closed doors that he believed the conversation was inappropriate and immediately alerted his superior to that fact. Vindman will testify publicly Tuesday morning.

*Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify Wednesday morning in what will be the most-watched (and potentially most consequential) of the week's testimony. Sondland has been identified as taking a call with Trump on July 26 to convey that the Ukrainians were ready to announce an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Sondland also revised his original closed-door testimony to note that he had, in early September, told a top Ukrainian official that the hold-up of nearly $400 million in US military aid was directly due to the lack of an announcement of a Biden investigation. (There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.)

If this week on the impeachment front is as bad as last week -- and there is every indication it will be -- Trump will be in a world of hurt.

4. Kamala's collapse continues: The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new CNN/Des Moines Register pol l, it isn't working; Harris is at 3% with a bunch of other longer-shot candidates.)

That external turmoil is reportedly mirrored by internal fighting, with fingers being pointed at Harris' campaign manager, according to terrific reporting by Politico's Christopher Cadelago . Cadelago writes in a devastating piece on Harris' campaign:

""As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez.""

Having seen a lot of presidential candidacies over my time covering this stuff (aka I am old), I can say unequivocally that this is how campaigns end. Money problems, poll problems and, finally, the blame game. Harris has already qualified for this week's debate (much more on that below) and the next debate in December, but I'm skeptical she can hold on for another week with this current trajectory.

3. Trump's health questions: On Saturday, President Trump made an On Saturday, President Trump made an unscheduled and unannounced visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to undergo a ""quick exam and labs"" that was, according to the White House, part of his annual physical. ""Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, DC, to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed,"" explained White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.

Trump echoed that sentiment in a tweet Sunday morning , casting the visit as ""phase one of my yearly physical"" and pronouncing that ""everything very good (great!).""

But given a) the unscheduled nature of the trip b) the fact that his two previous yearly physical exams were on his official calendar and announced to the media and c) the fact that Trump is 73, it seems as though more questions will (and should) be asked about what exactly happened on Saturday.

All of those questions -- why was it an unannounced visit, why did he start his physical less than a year after his last one, etc. -- may well be easily answered to everyone's satisfaction. But given the way Trump obfuscated about his health as a candidate -- Dr. Harold Bornstein, anyone? -- they are questions that should be answered by this White House.

And then there is the fact that Trump -- in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton and again in 2020 targeting potential rival Joe Biden -- has sought to raise questions about his opponents' mental and physical heath. To insufficiently answer questions about his own health would seem to be, in a word, hypocritical.

2. A new Iowa front-runner: It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll proves just how much momentum the man they call Mayor Pete has.

Buttigieg has a 9-point lead over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a 10-point edge over both Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Which is remarkable given that Buttigieg was entirely unknown in the state as recently as a year ago.

What's more remarkable -- and more worrisome for Buttigieg's rivals -- is the trend line in Iowa for the mayor. Buttigieg is up 16 percentage points since a September CNN/DMR poll while both Warren (down 6 points) and Biden (down 5 points) lost support over that time. (Sanders gained 4 points from September to today.)

And Buttigieg's approval numbers suggest he will be difficult to topple in the remaining months before the Iowa caucuses. Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) have a favorable view of Mayor Pete while just 16% have an unfavorable one. That's both the highest favorable number and the lowest unfavorable number in the field. Plus, the 42% who said they feel ""very"" favorably toward Buttigieg is rivaled only by the 36% who say the same of Warren.

1. It's starting to get late in the debates: On Wednesday in Atlanta, 10 Democratic candidates will take the stage at Tyler Perry Studios. For eight of them, it will be their fifth debate of the primary season. For one -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- it will be her fourth. (Gabbard did not qualify for the August debate.) And for billionaire Tom Steyer, it will be his second (straight) debate -- after a late entry in the field causes him to miss the first three set-to's.

While more debates remain before the first vote in Iowa, this week's debate feels like the last best chance for the second-tier (and below) candidates to begin building the momentum they need to seriously challenge for the nomination.

Case in point: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She is at 6% in the most recent CNN/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa -- behind the front-running four but above the low single-digit crowd. Klobuchar has been solid in the debates to date but has struggled to build momentum coming off of her above-average performances. She's running out of time -- and needs to find a way to distinguish herself (and turn that into votes) in this debate.

No matter what happens, Klobuchar will have another debate in December. (She is one of six candidates who have already qualified for the Los Angeles debate.) Which makes the stakes for her high but not as high as the four candidates on stage Wednesday who haven't qualified for next month's debate yet : New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and technologist Andrew Yang as well as Steyer and Gabbard.

Booker may be in the most tenuous place of those four, as the New Jersey Democrat entered the 2020 race with high expectations that he simply has not met. Unless Booker has a standout performance Wednesday, he may well miss the next debate. And if someone of his stature is missing a debate two months before thew actual vote, it's hard to justify staying in the race."

Among likely Democratic caucusgoers, 45% say the inquiry would make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win in 2020 compared to 24% who believe it will make it harder. The share of those who say they are not sure what impact the inquiry will have is roughly the same across both voter groups.

The findings come on the heels of the first week of public testimony in the inquiry with another eight witnesses slated to testify in open hearings this week. The poll was largely conducted before public hearings began.

When it comes to registered Republicans, 30% say they're following the inquiry very closely, with another 25% saying they're following them fairly closely. Among those Republicans following the proceedings very or fairly closely, 72% say they'll make it easier for Trump to win re-election, while just 46% of those who are tracking it somewhat closely or not at all say that's the case.

The Hill-HarrisX poll, taken among 449 registered voters November 16 – 17, 2019, showed Joe Biden (D) – who has been in a back and forth with both Warren and Sanders, as recent polls indicate – leading the pack with 30 percent of the vote. Sanders overtook Warren for second place, with 18 percent to the Massachusetts senator’s 15 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in Iowa, came in fourth place with seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who garnered just four percent support. Notably, billionaire Michael Bloomberg came in right behind the California lawmaker with three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less.

The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percentage points:

The latest Pew Research Center survey finds that about six-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they believe increased security along the United States-Mexico border is very or somewhat important — a policy that is opposed by leading 2020 Democrat presidential candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

Among all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters, nearly half said they believe increased border and immigration controls are very or somewhat important — including nearly 40 percent of self-identified liberals.

When it comes to deportations of illegal aliens, more than four-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they support increasing the number of illegal aliens who are deported from the U.S. About 31 percent of all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters support increasing deportations.

The findings are the latest instance where moderate and conservative Democrat voters have broken with 2020 Democrats’ plans for opening the nation’s borders to more illegal and legal immigration beyond the already historically high levels at which about 1.5 million foreign-born residents come to the U.S. every year.

A New York Times/Siena College poll this month found that a majority of Biden’s most conservative supporters want less immigration overall to the U.S. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of 54 percent of Biden voters who oppose Warren said they want legal immigration levels reduced.

The Democrat Party’s decades-long shift to support endless levels of immigration to the U.S. is primarily driven by white liberals who are plagued with “white guilt” and “privilege awareness,” recent research has found.

A July poll by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist showed that a plurality of moderate Democrats — 47 percent — called providing free healthcare to all illegal aliens a “bad idea.” A majority of 56 percent of moderate voters said the same of the plan which has been endorsed by nearly all 2020 Democrat presidential candidates.

Biden made waves over the weekend after expressing skepticism of legalizing marijuana at the federal level, contending that there is “not nearly” enough evidence to definitively determine if it acts as a “gateway drug.”

“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden told an audience in Las Vegas, Nevada, over the weekend. “It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

“It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally,” he continued. “I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

The presidential hopeful’s remark sparked responses from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — who has vowed to legalize marijuana within the first 100 days in the office via executive order and create federal programs designed to help former convicts secure jobs in the marijuana industry — and his supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 18, 2019

Modine’s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats — Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion.

A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks.

The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren’s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.

The Biden campaign’s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful’s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter — a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren — and reported just $9 million cash on hand.

“His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,” as Breitbart News noted."

Bill Richardson (D) predicted the 2020 Democrat presidential primary is heading toward a brokered convention and suggested delegates could nominate former first lady Michelle Obama to face off against President Donald Trump in 2020.

A partial transcript is as follows:

MICHAEL SMERCONISH: Governor, what do you think? Are we headed to a brokered convention?

BILL RICHARDSON: I believe we are headed toward a brokered convention for the following reason. There’s a total of 4,600 delegates that are out there, 3,800 are pledged. But these superdelegates, 785, could be the margin of victory. They can’t vote until after the second ballot. But If you look at the top tier, Mayor Pete, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and potentially two formidable candidates in Bloomberg and Patrick coming in, they’re all bunched up around 20 percent or a little lower. And you need 1,918 to get a first-ballot victory. I don’t see any way that’s going to happen, Michael. So I think we’re going into a brokered convention. The new rules from the Democratic National Committee point to a brokered convention in the second and third ballot, where everybody’s free after the second ballot, third ballot. Potentially, some new candidates might emerge that perhaps didn’t enter the primary like Michelle Obama.

SMERCONISH: Woah, you’re making news here. Do you really think that’s a possibility that she would get in?

RICHARDSON: I think the delegates would want somebody that can win. There’s desperation for victory. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Michelle Obama, somebody like that. Possibly Tom Hanks, the actor. I know that’s a little farfetched. But, Democrats right now, there could be a very divided brokered convention where everybody is mad at each other and then somebody new emerges. That’s a possibility."

The Douglass Plan, named for the (Republican) former slave and abolitionist, proposes a variety of policies aimed at helping black Americans, alongside a committee to study the issue of reparations, which Buttigieg also backs.

The plan is partly aimed at addressing Buttigieg’s persistent weakness among black voters, which is partly the result of difficulties in his relationship with the black community in South Bend. He fired the city’s first black police chief, then faced criticism from the black community after an officer-involved shooting earlier this year. When he tried to make amends by accusing the police department of racism, he faced criticism from law enforcement as well.

As The Intercept reported Friday (original links):

When pressed on the lack of black support, Buttigieg and his campaign have made repeated references to the Douglass Plan, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass. “Our response to those who ask what our agenda for black America is, is the Douglass Plan.” Buttigieg said recently on CNN. “It is the most comprehensive vision put forward by a 2020 candidate on the question of how we’re going to tackle systemic racism in this country.” … The campaign hasn’t publicly claimed that every supporter of the plan listed is African American, though it wouldn’t be hard to draw that implication: It was published in the HBCU Times, and the bylines and top-listed supporters are all black. To be sure, a multiracial coalition would be needed to push the Douglass Plan through Congress, but the campaign didn’t say that, either. After publication, the Buttigieg campaign said it had sent the plan to the list of supporters and asked them to opt out if they did not want their name included on the list. That email also specified that the list was meant to represent “over 400 Black South Carolinians.”

In an email sent by the campaign, Buttigieg touted support from 400 black South Carolinians, according to Slate.

But as The Intercept reported, not all of those who signed on were black — and not all who signed on were aware that they had. Three of the signatories, one of whom has already endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), were shocked to see that the Buttigieg campaign was touting their support when they had not, in fact, backed the plan.

Moreover:

Whatever the intent, a review of the 422 names on the list of supporters finds that at least 297 of them appear in the South Carolina voter file. … But for 184 of them, the voter file lists either one name, or lists multiple people, all of whom self-identify as white — so at least 42 percent of the entire list is white. And that means 62 percent of the 297 names that can be reliably checked are white.

Other names, the Intercept reported, are repeated, or are from outside the U.S.

Slate published the Buttigieg campaign’s response to the story, claiming it never meant to mislead anyone — but revealing that it had used an “opt-out” process, rather than specifically asking “supporters” to opt into the plan:

In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren’t comfortable being listed and we removed them.

Moreover, according to the Intercept’s Ryan Grim, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan:

The latest poll in South Carolina has Buttigieg in a distant fourth place, at 8%, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads the field with 45%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at 17% and Sanders at 15%.

America First Policies, the president’s official Super PAC, gave Breitbart News on Monday an exclusive sneak peek at findings from its focus group work nationwide in the last month. The organization has now conducted 18 separate focus groups in nine different American cities since late October.

Those cities include Des Moines, Iowa, Orlando, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona, Miami, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. America First Policies has gathered 36 total hours of focus group data from the participants, all of whom are independents or swing voters in their respective cities.

The biggest takeaway from all the groups, including one in Pittsburgh thatwas conducted after the first House Intelligence Committee public impeachment hearing last Wednesday that featured State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent, is that swing voters are not being moved in the slightest against Trump by the impeachment narrative Democrats are offering.

America First Policies screened footage from these focus groups for Breitbart News at their headquarters just outside the nation’s capital on Monday afternoon, including the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, group that was filmed after that first Democrat impeachment hearing. When the moderator asked the room if anyone thinks Donald Trump should be impeached, not a single person in the room—all independents, most of whom do not like Trump’s personality—said they did.

After a moment of silence when the focus group conductor asked the room of independents if Trump should be impeached, a man finally said: “Not even close.”

The man continued when asked why the Democrats are pushing for impeachment:

This is their platform. This is all they got—and what they got is nothing. They want to keep to politics and Trump is not a politician. They are going to do everything they can because he bucked the system. He exposed what the draining the swamp and everything means. That’s the thing—they don’t even have anything close to valid. It’s just nothing. Instead of focusing on policies, they’re trying to do this to win the election.

When the moderator asks another man how House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has done handling the impeachment inquiry so far, he replies: “I don’t know because I can’t believe half of what the media puts out because they’re biased—and there’s been no proof on the table.”

“I’m not all Trump… I’m not a party voter,” that man continues. “But he calls it like it is. He’s a renegade… Do I respect the man? I don’t. But I respect the office. But I don’t see where they have enough to say he knew about it so…”

Up next was a woman, who said she is not a Trump supporter but thinks the president is getting railroaded:

I’m not a Trump supporter by any means, but I totally disagree with what they’re doing. I know he’s not perfect, but by the same coin he’s right there and he tells you how it is. I don’t agree with all of the things. But at least he’s trying to do things.

After that another woman and another man—both of whom are not Trump supporters—made the case that Democrats’ impeachment goals are meaningless because the Senate will clear Trump even if the House impeaches him.

“Sadly, I don’t feel—just because they’ll stick to party lines—that this will go anywhere,” the woman said.

“And they have to know that, so then you have to ask why they’re doing this,” the man added.

“Correct,” the woman concurred. “It’s just a waste of the taxpayers’ money.”

Another man said he thinks the Democrats are doing it so Trump “has an asterisk next to his name going into the next election.” He went on:

But another thing is I think it shows a weakness, or a lack of confidence, in the Democrat field and concern that their eventual candidate can’t beat Donald Trump. Otherwise, why would you be doing this a year out from the election?

This dismissal of impeachment was a consistent theme throughout the focus groups that America First Policies conducted throughout the country. Generally speaking, most of the focus groups—video from all of which Breitbart News reviewed in America First’s northern Virginia offices—had no supporters of even the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. The handful of those that did support an actual inquiry—because they want elected leaders like Trump to face scrutiny and they support investigations, not because they think he actually did anything wrong—certainly do not think there is enough evidence to impeach, never mind convict Trump and remove him from office.

A woman in the North Carolina focus group, for instance, said Democrats are “wasting a lot of time and money” pursuing Trump’s impeachment and should instead “get back to doing what they’re supposed to be doing, passing laws.”

A man in that group also summed up what independents are thinking, dismissing the Democrats’ impeachment agenda:

When the news of this first broke, I was sitting there thinking okay these are conversations that mostly went on and then you step back and look what they are—from what media outlet—and you go, okay, his personality is arrogant. We’ve all seen him say something stupid. However, on the flip side of that, all this secrecy—the smoke and mirrors—the unwillingness to unmask the whistleblower out of fears of safety. Come on. What are you hiding?

These sentiments on impeachment were not the only thing that America First’s focus groups uncovered. Another consistent theme is that while these independent swing voters like President Trump’s policies and what he’s accomplished for the country, they do not like his personality or his tweets.

Generally speaking, the swing voters wish Trump would tweet less attacks on opponents—and not say certain things sometimes. But they did also reveal that while the voters find Trump’s abrasive personality off-putting at times, they do like that he is a “street fighter” in the words of one and that he has exposed corruption in the federal government.

Perhaps most importantly for Trump, the voters do not see him as part of the political system—they do not consider Trump a “politician,” despite the fact he’s been in office for nearly three years now—and they still consider him an outsider or “renegade,” in the words of one Pittsburgh-area independent.

What’s more, America First’s focus groups also uncovered a lot of sentiment among independents about several of the top Democrat presidential candidates. Regarding former Vice President Joe Biden, top terms focus group participants used were “too old,” “forgetful,” and “Obama’s second hand.” They also described Biden as a “creep” who makes unwanted advances against young women and as “the swamp,” a sign that America First Policies officials believe demonstrates that attacks on Biden’s son Hunter Biden are breaking through to voters nationwide.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is described as a “socialist,” “outspoken,” a “liar,” and “academic.” Warren’s history of falsely claiming to be a Native American has broken through, as several of the independent voters in the focus groups across the country called Warren “Pocahontas.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, was described as “too old,” “angry,” “crazy,” and “socialist.”

Another interesting finding from these focus groups is that these independent voters do not see much of a difference between any of the Democrats, even when there are actual policy-specific nuances separating them. For instance, when former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke (D-TX) called for door-to-door gun confiscation and mandatory government-controlled buybacks of Americans’ firearms before he later dropped out of the presidential race, one woman in a North Carolina focus group expressed outrage at the whole Democrat field over it. She said:

“I watched ten minutes of the Democratic debate and when I heard somebody talking about taking your guns I thought ‘you just fucking killed yourself.’ What was he talking about when he was saying he was going to take our guns?”

“No way in hell are they getting our guns,” another woman said.

The woman did not use the name “Beto O’Rourke” when expressing her frustrations with Democrats on gun confiscation, but just broadly spoke of all the Democrats like this. America First Policies officials told Breitbart News that generally speaking on issues like gun confiscation, illegal immigration, and healthcare—particularly the backing of the government takeover of healthcare through “Medicare For All”—these focus group voters do not see much nuance between the different Democrats’ plans and policy visions, a problem for Democrats as swing voters are painting them all with a broad brush into radically leftist socialist positions.

What’s more, the only two Democrat candidates for president these focus group independent swing voters spoke highly of were Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and businessman Andrew Yang. The swing voters, the America First Policies officials told Breitbart News, like Gabbard’s military service and the fight she just got in with 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. As for Yang, they said, the voters are intrigued by his different kinds of ideas like the universal basic income idea."

Buttigieg was speaking at a Latino candidate forum after attending a convention of the state’s Democrats, whom he has been courting aggressively ahead of California’s March 3 primary, in Long Beach.

The Golden State, which has the largest delegate haul, has traditionally voted in June, but state leaders chose to shift it earlier to give voters a bigger role in determining the winner of presidential primaries.

Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn’t violate Mexico’s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn’t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically — do you see a time when troops can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation — as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partner south of the border.

Buttigieg seems to have missed the point of the question: that American lives are, in fact, on the line.

The Sacramento Bee reports that Buttigieg was the only candidate who faced a direct question about sending troops to Mexico.

Other candidates were sharply critical of Buttigieg’s remarks. Aggressive rhetoric about Mexico is taboo in the Democratic Party, ever since President Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on building a wall along the border — and making Mexico pay for it.

(Since then, Trump has ordered the military to build new portions of “wall” — heavy bollard fencing — along the border, over congressional objections, and secured an agreement with Mexico to place thousands of troops at its southern border, at its expense.)

Buttigieg remains in single digits in most nationwide polls, occupying fourth place, the first of the second-tier candidates, well behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the front of the pack. He is leading in recent polls in Iowa, however, and is focusing his resources in early primary states.

Meanwhile, delegates to the convention were reportedly suggesting that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) drop out, given that she is polling poorly in her own home state.

Harris has focused her campaign’s dwindling resources on Iowa, rather than on nearby Nevada, the third primary state, where she has a geographical advantage.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) signaled that she is open to a universal basic income – an idea that has been championed by fellow presidential contender Andrew Yang (D).

Warren expressed her willingness to consider a UBI, which quite literally amounts to the government handing individuals and families a “basic” income per month regardless of employment or income status, in a Washington Post survey that asked, “Should the federal government pay a universal basic income to every American adult?”

Three candidates were listed as supporting the measure – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Marianne Williamson (D), and Yang. Notably, two candidates were listed as “open to it” – Julián Castro (D) and Warren.

“We absolutely must raise wages and strengthen the social safety net so that every American has basic financial security. Universal basic income and universal living wages are options to consider,” Warren told the Post, noting her push for a $15 minimum wage.

She continued:

To raise wages, I have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, and empowering American workers at big American corporations to elect no less than 40 percent of the company board members — giving workers a powerful voice in corporate decisions about wages and benefits.

Her position is drastically different than Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT), who typically holds similar views to Warren. He has openly expressed skepticism of a universal basic income, contending that his federal jobs guarantee is better because “people want to work.”

“We take a very different approach from Mr. Yang and that is I believe in a jobs guarantee,” Sanders told Hill.TV in August.

He continued:

The challenge that we face is how do we use technology to improve the lives of working people. So if you have a really terrible job, a boring job and we make your job better and we enable you to work 20 hours a week rather than 40 hours a week, it’s not a bad thing…but it means to say you still need an income to live by, we can’t cut your salaries in half.

I asked @BernieSanders how he would deal with automation and why he believes a federal jobs guarantee is superior to UBI.

He repeated that sentiment to the Post:

Sanders believes that all Americans are entitled to economic rights. These include the right to a decent job with good pay, affordable housing, quality health care, a clean environment, and a secure retirement. We will guarantee a good-paying job to all Americans through a federal job guarantee program to ensure everyone has a decent quality of life. Furthermore, [Sanders] strongly supports the BOOST Act, introduced by Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib to guarantee all Americans an income.

Yang, a strong proponent of the measure, addressed Sanders’ critique.

“Bernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day,” he said.

“He also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government, which isn’t true,” Yang continued.

“It’s very strange – he seemed open and warm to the idea of a Universal Basic Income not too long ago,” he added. “Now he seems irritated every time it comes up”:

Yang has argued that a guaranteed income will “Americans will work even harder”:

However, numerous studies and experiments have idicated that a UBI does not necessarily leave recipients better off. The Washington Post analyzed the experiment on the small scale, in which a non-profit gave “20 African American single mothers living in public housing $1,000 each month for a year” with no strings attached. While the women were able to buy necessities, they also spent money on nonessentials, with one woman noting that she “blew all of it.”

Despite that, the Post did not necessarily deem the experiment a failure, blaming the lack of fruitful results on the participants’ “lack of ‘experience’ in handling discretionary income,” as Breitbart News reported."

Elizabeth Warren has promised that ""Medicare for All"" will not cost the middle class one penny more in taxes.

That vow, however, is possible largely because the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate asserts that creating a single-payer health insurance system will cost a whole lot less than many others think it will. That includes her fellow 2020 contender Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the bill.

Warren's financing estimate relies on being able to greatly curb health care spending -- more than is reasonably possible, some experts say.

Warren's campaign unveiled a financing plan earlier this month that pegged the cost of Medicare for All at $20.5 trillion over a decade, significantly lower than the $30-plus trillion estimates calculated by several think tanks and academics. While Sanders has not released a detailed financing plan or price tag, he has acknowledged it will likely cost north of $30 trillion.

Warren gets to the lower figure in two ways: She requires states and local governments to redirect the $6 trillion they now spend on health care to the federal government to help foot the bill. But her plan also depends heavily on cutting administrative expenses, prescription drug prices and reimbursements to hospitals and doctors, as well as slowing the overall growth rate of health care spending.

Some policy experts question whether all those costs could actually be wrung out of the nation's health care system. It matters because if it doesn't happen, then Warren would need to raise even more money in taxes -- possibly having to turn to the middle class.

""The shortfall would be in the trillions of dollars if those assumptions perform the way most people think they'll perform,"" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank.

To finance Medicare for All, Warren calls for increasing taxes on the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations, as well as requiring employers to contribute. Some experts also doubt whether these levies would raise the amounts she projects.

Warren worked with two prominent experts to develop the $20.5 trillion cost estimate. They reviewed seven previous single-payer cost analyses, but also incorporated other studies and the experiences in other developed countries.

""I stand by the estimates that we came up with. They were in no cases extreme,"" said Don Berwick, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration. ""They were estimates based on the evidence we had.""

The Warren campaign pointed to the 24-page analysis by ""leading experts"" such as Berwick that backs up the policy choices the senator made beyond the Medicare for All Act.

""Every policy choice is validated by robust empirical research, supported by experts, and grounded in real data,"" said spokeswoman Saloni Sharma. She pointed to two other academic studies that had lower cost estimates than Warren's. ""People who disagree with the numbers should show us theirs.""

Here are four big spending assumptions contained in Warren's plan:

Slashing administrative costs: The US shells out far more than other countries in this area, in part because it has multiple payers, including private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid. Private insurers spend 12.2% of premiums collected on administrative costs, while Medicare spends 2.3%, according to federal data.

Warren would set Medicare for All administrative spending at 2.3%, which would save $1.8 trillion over a decade, according to the analysis by Berwick and Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.

That spending rate is too low for experts at the Urban Institute, who recently published an analysis of a Medicare for All-type plan that pegged the cost at $34 trillion over a decade. They consider 6% to be more reasonable because, as the sole payer, the federal government will have to invest in managing care, monitoring quality and access and preventing fraud and abuse.

""Medicare doesn't do a lot to monitor utilization and to try to control spending,"" said John Holahan, an institute fellow at Urban Institute and one of the analysis' authors. ""In a system like [Medicare for All], where everything is free, I think you are going to have to do a lot more of that.""

Reforming prescription drug pricing: Warren has outlined some aggressive cost reduction targets -- seeking to bring down Medicare prices for brand-name drugs by 70% and for generic medications by 30% from current levels. She would do this mainly by allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices and by overriding patents or providing public support to manufacture the drugs if bargaining fails.

The senator's plan bears some similarities to the prescription drug price bill making its way through the House and backed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But it would set a lower price than the House bill and eliminate the limit on the number of drugs subject to negotiation every year, among other changes.

The Urban analysis had estimated a roughly 30% reduction in prescription drug prices, which it thought had a better shot of getting through Congress and the influential pharmaceutical lobbyists. As it is, the House bill has divided progressive and moderate Democrats, which has delayed bringing it to the floor for a vote. It's considered dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Overall, Warren's prescription drug reform plan would save $1.7 trillion over a decade, according to the analysis done for her campaign.

Reducing payments to hospitals and doctors: Warren proposes drastically Warren proposes drastically cutting reimbursement rates for many providers.

She would pay hospitals an average of 110% of Medicare rates, which she said would cover their current cost of caring for patients. She argues that hospitals will still come out ahead because their administrative and drug expenses would be lower and because everyone would have insurance -- meaning fewer non-paying consumers.

Doctors, meanwhile, would be paid at current Medicare rates, though Warren would increase reimbursements for primary care doctors and lower them for certain specialists, whom she called ""overpaid."" Physicians would also benefit since they would spend less time on billing and dealing with insurance companies, she said.

These rates would be a big haircut from those paid by private insurers, though it would be a bump up from Medicaid reimbursement. So just how it affects providers would depend on their mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients. This, along with other payment reforms, would save $2.9 trillion over a decade.

Still, the powerful hospital and physician groups would fight such a change in reimbursements. For instance, when devising a state-run public insurance option earlier this year, Washington lawmakers wound up capping payments at an average of 160% of Medicare rates, instead of just Medicare rates, after an outcry from the industry. That reduced projected premium savings to only 5% to 10%, instead of 40%.

""These [Medicare] rates are simply so punishing to doctors, nurses and hospital employees compared to private insurance that there will be revolt among the medical profession,"" Kessler said. ""So there will either be an expensive rollback or demonstrations in the street.""

Slowing health care spending growth: Overall, Warren's proposal would lower the rate of health care spending growth in the US so that it falls in line with overall economic growth, according to the analysis done for the campaign. This would save $1.1 trillion over a decade.

That will be possible in part because currently about one-third of the spending -- roughly $1 trillion -- is low value, Berwick said. That gives the US a lot of opportunity to eliminate these wasteful expenditures under Medicare for All.

But other experts doubt that will be possible.

""To get down to GDP growth is not something we've ever done in this country,"" Holahan said."

(CNN) The American political debate over health care is absurd. Americans pay twice as much as any other nation for health care, and then are told daily that they ""can't afford"" to switch to a lower-cost system very similar to those of Canada and Europe. If President Donald Trump and the plutocratic Republican party were the only ones carrying this ridiculous message, it would be understandable. Yet this message is also coming from media pundits aligned with the Democratic Party and the most conservative wing of the party.

Let's be clear on the central point. Medicare for All, as first proposed by Bernie Sanders and endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, is affordable precisely because it is cheaper , much cheaper, than the current system.

America's health care system relies on local monopolies (such as a health care provider centered at the sole major hospital in a city) and national monopolies, notably pharmaceutical companies holding exclusive patents.

In other countries, the government sets delivery prices and typically pays the health bills through the budget. In the US, the monopolists set the prices.

The sky-high revenues end up as huge corporate profits, wasteful administrative costs, useless and even harmful advertising and lavish salaries. Health care CEOs are making gargantuan salaries , many exceeding $10 million per year.

Who loses? Almost all Americans, whose insurance costs and out-of-pocket outlays inevitably lead to lower income because of unaffordable health care costs, untreated chronic illnesses, premature mortality and personal bankruptcies. Single-payer systems such as in Canada and Europe are cheaper, fairer and have better outcomes.

A recent international comparison of the performance of 11 national health systems on five main dimensions (care process, access, efficiency, equity and health care outcomes) ranked the US health system dead last.

Despite all of this, the US pundits profess to be alarmed about the prospect of Medicare for All. There has been a wave of op-eds and columns published (for example, here and here and here ) declaring that Medicare for All would lead to massive tax increases, and that Sanders' and Warren's support for Medicare for All threatens to reelect Trump. It's ridiculous.

Both Sanders and Warren poll well against Trump, ahead in the overall popular vote (though like all Democrats, facing headwinds of the Electoral College).

And at this stage of a national campaign, the goal should be to explain to voters the vast benefits of a single-payer system rather than to prejudge the politics based on self-fulfilling fearmongering.

Yes, one way or another, taxes would rise with Medicare for All, but private health outlays would go down by much more. Total health costs would fall.

That idea is not so hard to understand.

One influential pundit, economist Paul Krugman, has come around . In the 2016 election cycle, Krugman railed against Medicare for All. Yet after Warren laid out her proposal, Krugman supported Medicare for All. In truth, he was simply returning to the economically sound observations that he had long made before 2016.

The pundits seem to believe that Americans will rebel at ""higher taxes."" Actually, Americans are much smarter than that. They know that their current private health care payments, whether insurance premiums or out-of-pocket, are nothing other than ""taxes"" they pay to stay alive. They'll agree to pay higher taxes to the government if those new taxes eliminate larger private health care bills -- again, there are ""taxes"" by any other name -- that they now pay.

Some mainstream pundits are simply repeating what they hear from Democratic Party conservatives and centrists, the wing that has been dominant since Clinton's election in 1992. They are following the lead of Nancy Pelosi, Pete Buttigieg and others who are trashing Medicare for All.

What in the world are these leading Democratic Party politicians doing in opposing the transition to a fairer, more efficient and lower cost health care system? I would suggest it's not a lack of understanding. It's the power of campaign financing. These Democrats are funded by the status quo. The health sector contributed $265 million to federal campaigns in 2018, of which 56% went to Democrats. The sector spends nearly $500 million per year on lobbying. Money talks. Meanwhile, Americans go bankrupt or die early.

There remains the issue of the best way to raise budget revenues for Medicare for All. The basic answer is to use progressive taxation to fund the program. In this way, the nation as a whole will pay much less for health care and the vast majority of households will as well. The highest income households will end up paying a bit more because their funds will not only finance their own health care but will help to pay the health care costs of the poorest households as well.

Sanders rightly proposed a menu of options to pay for Medicare for All, including payroll and income taxation. Warren has proposed one specific approach: progressive taxes on the super-rich and the corporate sector but also a surprisingly regressive ""head tax"" on companies. She took great pride in not charging a penny of new income or payroll taxes on middle class households. But the proposed head tax on companies would hit wages indirectly and regressively.

Still, both Sanders' and Warrens' approaches would result in a more equitable and less expensive system. For most households, overall health care costs will decline.

The most worrisome thing about Warren's statement as she introduced her Medicare for All plan, is her emphasis on ""not one penny"" of new middle-class taxes. Here we go again. The Democrats have, for far too long, copied the Republican mantra about ""no new taxes,"" even as our public debt soars, our infrastructure and public services collapse and inequality reaches stratospheric dimensions.

To honor the silly stricture of ""no new taxes"" directly paid by middle-class households, Warren ended up endorsing a regressive head tax paid by the employer, which would end up hitting lower-wage workers even though its paid by their employers.

Let's hope this blunder is a one-time stumble for Warren. Most importantly, both Sanders and Warren are pointing the correct way to reform America's costly, unfair and inefficient health care system. And this is a goal that most Americans support."

That's especially true of Biden's support among African Americans, a critical voting bloc in a Democratic presidential primary.

Two polls released Monday out of South Carolina tell that story. In a Quinnipiac University poll , Biden is at 33% with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a distant second at 13%. A University of North Florida poll showed much the same -- Biden at 36% with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lagging well behind at 10% each.

Among black voters in the Quinnipiac poll, Biden took 44% to 10% for Sanders and just 8% for Warren. (South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg received less than 1% of the black vote in South Carolina in the new Q poll. Ouch.)

Of the UNF poll, Dr. Michael Binder, faculty director of the Public Opinion Research Lab, said : ""Buoyed by his support among African American voters, Biden has an established lead far above the other contenders in South Carolina.""

Hilary Gowins is vice president of communications at the Illinois Policy Institute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants a wealth tax. She says she needs it to fund massive new government spending ventures that include clean energy, affordable housing, Social Security benefits, universal childcare, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation, free college and Medicare for All. She also believes a wealth tax is needed because rising income inequality generally has a negative effect on the economy.

She's half right.

Rising income inequality is indeed a problem for economic growth. But taxing wealth could exacerbate the problem, not fix it. That's because the bulk of the wealth Warren is counting on to pay the bills is not sitting under a mattress. Instead, America's wealthiest men and women often invest in new business capital, resulting in innovation and jobs that American consumers and workers largely benefit from.

Warren wants to enact a tax of 2% per year on household wealth above $50 million, with an additional 1% levy on wealth above $1 billion. Since most of the estimated wealth of billionaires is invested in companies that innovate and create jobs, Warren's wealth tax could — if it successfully seizes a large amount of assets from the world's best allocators of capital — lead to less investment, ultimately harming workers and consumers.

Economist Larry Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary who advised presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, has stated publicly — and repeatedly — that one of the many reasons wealth taxes fail is due to much higher tax avoidance and tax evasion than the 15% estimated by Warren's economic advisers. They had estimated that the super-wealthy already tend to understate their wealth to avoid taxes by roughly 15%, but as numerous economists, including Summers, pointed out, the rate of tax avoidance would be much higher since tax avoidance is an increasing function of the tax rate. That means that at higher tax rates, tax avoidance would also increase.

But more importantly, there's also a question of how a wealth tax would affect economic growth.

The economy grows when people put money back into it. It grows even faster when capital flows freely into great ideas and new projects. America continues to lead the world in patent filings because of the investments of wealthy American investors.

Has a wealth tax ever been an effective means of promoting economic growth? France — a country that had a wealth tax until 2017 — proves that the tax is a massive risk.

Eric Pichet, a professor of economics, estimated the costs of the wealth tax in France: Capital flight amounted to over $200 billion, an annual fiscal shortfall of almost $7 billion — or about twice the revenue it generated — as well as a reduction in GDP growth of $3.5 billion per year. It's estimated that France's wealth tax led to the exodus of 10,000 millionaires in 2015 alone . President Emmanuel Macron ended the country's wealth tax in 2017 because of the havoc it wreaked on the French economy.

Sure, some ultra-rich Americans made their money by inheriting it. But most billionaires are self-made . They worked hard and invested. They're not hoarders — they're actually infusing massive amounts of money into the American economy and creating jobs. A wealth tax could drastically reduce those investments.

We have to consider what we, as a country, want our public policy to encourage. We shouldn't be taxing ownership, industriousness and hard work. As a country, we should shift away from taxing income and we should never discourage investment and ownership. There is no surer way out of poverty and up the economic ladder than via the accumulation of human and physical capital.

There is a better model — taxing consumption, not income or wealth. Laurence Kotlikoff, a leading economist at Boston University, suggests taxes should not penalize investments that make good-paying jobs a reality. Instead of taxing wealth, Kotlikoff wants to tax how much the rich consume; income-in minus investment-out equals consumption. Under this plan, billionaire investors would pay lower taxes than billionaires who spend lavishly on private jets and mega yachts. Under Kotlikoff's plan , only consumption in excess of $100,000 would be taxed at rates that rise from 0% to 30%.

Taxing consumption makes sense for many reasons. For one thing, it encourages new investments. These new investments would make workers more productive, improve living standards and grow the economy.

A consumption tax is easier to enforce, too. A wealth tax includes everything you own, such as money in the bank, along with property and everything in it, such as expensive paintings for example, making the tax base difficult to estimate.

Currently, the US tax code favors different types of income over others, creating loopholes that have exacerbated the gap between the rich and the poor. Shifting away from an income tax toward a consumption tax would simplify our federal tax code while making sure it doesn't contribute to rising income inequality. Eliminating progressive income taxes in favor of taxing consumption on a cash-flow basis, is fair, easy to enforce and would help sustain higher rates of economic growth and it would be less costly to enforce and nearly impossible for the rich to evade, as the IRS already tracks income and investments. Consumption is whatever is left over, so it can easily be taxed.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a lawyer and entrepreneur from upstate New York, has pointed out that other countries such as France, Sweden, Germany and Denmark have all adopted a wealth tax, only to repeal the policy shortly afterward.

""If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?"" Yang asked on stage at the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate.

Yang's right. We don't have to repeat public policy failures. We can learn from others' mistakes and simplify the federal tax code to slow the growth in income inequality and continue to improve the nation's economy, attracting more workers to good paying jobs."

(CNN) Less than 10 days after six children and three women of a US family of were killed in Mexico, drawing national and international alarm, the Trump administration indicated it would move forward with a dangerous policy change that would make the types of weapons most likely used in that tragedy easier to export. The move seemingly skirts Congress and is counter to the apparent will of the American public. The change is tone deaf to today's needs and must be stopped.

Jeff Abramson

Found at the site of the brutal killings of members of the LeBaron family November 4 were more than 200 shell casings , according to Mexican officials, used primarily in AR-15-type assault rifles, weapons of choice of Mexican cartels. Recognizing the dangers these weapons can pose in fueling and extending conflicts around the globe, their export has for decades been regulated under a list of US military goods maintained by the State Department.

In 2002, Congress, understanding that it also needed to better oversee the export of these weapons, lowered the threshold of when it must be notified of potential sales to just $1 million, as opposed to $14 million for other major weapons. And, after decades of mass shootings here in the United States, a majority of the US public now simply favors banning them domestically.

Yet, just days after the massacre, the Trump administration quietly let Congress know that it would move ahead with controversial revisions that it proposed to US export laws by transferring oversight of semi-automatic firearms and their ammunition to a Commerce-controlled list. There, business concerns are more highly valued and Congress would no longer be informed of pending sales.

The change in export oversight has been in the works for years, but as I testified in March at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing, it is misguided and dangerous, based on the false assessment that because these weapons are less sophisticated they no longer deserve our highest attention.

That sentiment is stronger among registered Republicans who do not plan to attend the Democratic caucuses, with 60% saying the impeachment inquiry is more likely to make it easier than harder (26%) for President Donald Trump to win re-election. Among likely Democratic caucusgoers, 45% say the inquiry would make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win in 2020 compared to 24% who believe it will make it harder. The share of those who say they are not sure what impact the inquiry will have is roughly the same across both voter groups.

For their part, likely Democratic caucusgoers are more likely to report following the impeachment proceedings than are registered Republicans. Nearly seven-in-10 likely Democratic caucusgoers say they are following the proceedings, including 46% indicating they were following them very closely. Of those following very or fairly closely, 52% say the proceedings will make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win the general election. That compares to just 36% of those who are following the inquiry somewhat closely or not at all who feel it will make it easier.

The findings come on the heels of the first week of public testimony in the inquiry with another eight witnesses slated to testify in open hearings this week. The poll was largely conducted before public hearings began.

When it comes to registered Republicans, 30% say they're following the inquiry very closely, with another 25% saying they're following them fairly closely. Among those Republicans following the proceedings very or fairly closely, 72% say they'll make it easier for Trump to win re-election, while just 46% of those who are tracking it somewhat closely or not at all say that's the case.

Warren and Sanders have been battling it out in recent national and early voting state polls. The Hill-HarrisX poll, taken among 449 registered voters November 16 – 17, 2019, showed Joe Biden (D) – who has been in a back and forth with both Warren and Sanders, as recent polls indicate – leading the pack with 30 percent of the vote.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in Iowa, came in fourth place with seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who garnered just four percent support. Notably, billionaire Michael Bloomberg came in right behind the California lawmaker with three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less.

The latest Pew Research Center survey finds that about six-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they believe increased security along the United States-Mexico border is very or somewhat important — a policy that is opposed by leading 2020 Democrat presidential candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

Among all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters, nearly half said they believe increased border and immigration controls are very or somewhat important — including nearly 40 percent of self-identified liberals.

When it comes to deportations of illegal aliens, more than four-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they support increasing the number of illegal aliens who are deported from the U.S. About 31 percent of all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters support increasing deportations.

The findings are the latest instance where moderate and conservative Democrat voters have broken with 2020 Democrats’ plans for opening the nation’s borders to more illegal and legal immigration beyond the already historically high levels at which about 1.5 million foreign-born residents come to the U.S. every year.

A New York Times/Siena College poll this month found that a majority of Biden’s most conservative supporters want less immigration overall to the U.S. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of 54 percent of Biden voters who oppose Warren said they want legal immigration levels reduced.

The Democrat Party’s decades-long shift to support endless levels of immigration to the U.S. is primarily driven by white liberals who are plagued with “white guilt” and “privilege awareness,” recent research has found.

A July poll by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist showed that a plurality of moderate Democrats — 47 percent — called providing free healthcare to all illegal aliens a “bad idea.” A majority of 56 percent of moderate voters said the same of the plan which has been endorsed by nearly all 2020 Democrat presidential candidates.

A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina. Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent.

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively.

Biden’s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was “safe,” while 55 percent said the former vice president was “down to earth.” A further 71 percent believed Biden’s policy stances were “about right for defeating [President] Donald Trump” in 2020.

Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as “risky” by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist.

The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points.

Biden’s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent survey from Monmouth Poll estimated that more than six-in-ten of South Carolina’s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020.

Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates’ level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president’s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux.

In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter’s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president’s political position. Biden’s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs.

As Biden’s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg’s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor’s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina.

Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor’s speeches.

Another likely late entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend “whatever it takes” to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor’s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he’s already running.

As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president’s position in South Carolina.

When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg’s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn’t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey."

Biden made waves over the weekend after expressing skepticism of legalizing marijuana at the federal level, contending that there is “not nearly” enough evidence to definitively determine if it acts as a “gateway drug.”

“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden told an audience in Las Vegas, Nevada, over the weekend. “It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

“It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally,” he continued. “I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

The presidential hopeful’s remark sparked responses from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — who has vowed to legalize marijuana within the first 100 days in the office via executive order and create federal programs designed to help former convicts secure jobs in the marijuana industry — and his supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 18, 2019

Modine’s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats — Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion.

A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks.

The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren’s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.

The Biden campaign’s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful’s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter — a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren — and reported just $9 million cash on hand.

“His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,” as Breitbart News noted."

For president?

Because what people are looking for today as an alternative to the current occupant of the White House is a massively wealthy, arrogant New York City billionaire with his own fleet of private jets.

The only intelligent thing about Mr. Bloomberg running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency is what it says about the present crop of Democrats running for the nomination. They’re a hopeless bunch of losers who would rather destroy America than lose another election to President Trump.

Mr. Bloomberg isn’t really even a Democrat. He is whatever he needs to be at any given moment.

He was a Democrat. Then a Republican. Then an independent. Now he is a Democrat again.

And the only reason his candidacy is being pushed at the moment is that supposed Democrat “front-runner” Joseph R. Biden has defecated in his own bed and his son has wound up being perhaps the only criminal actor in the Democrats’ whole Ukraine impeachment crusade.

That, and the fact that Mr. Biden has been running for president for about 45 years and — STILL — nobody wants him. The former vice president’s sputtering campaign has opened the door to candidates with truly crazy socialist agendas, such as Elizabeth Warren.

Everybody knows Ms. Warren will be bad news for billionaires, perhaps the only slightly appealing thing about her. So the Forbes 500 list got together and came up with the perfect candidate to thwart the Warren campaign and take on Donald Trump.

Please, can you imagine Little Michael Bloomberg filling an arena in Milwaukee with thousands and thousands of screaming fans?

But this is the funniest thing about a Bloomberg campaign.

One of the oldest and biggest complaints about President Trump is his supposed arrogance. I would argue that Mr. Trump is actually a marvelously self-deprecating — yet thoroughly confident — politician. So much so that he revels in people’s fear that he is some kind of unstoppable dictator. He will NEVER relinquish the White House peacefully. He will run in 2020. And then in 2024. And 2028.

He openly jokes about this partly to remind voters of his fairly incredible stamina — as if Mr. Trump really might run for president at the age of 112.

But the joke is also meant to torment those stupid enough to take it seriously.

Which brings us back to Mr. Bloomberg. Who served THREE terms as mayor of a city that had a strict TWO-term limit on mayors.

But not for Little Mike. He had the law changed for himself so that he really could blow the term limit meant for politicians.

Good luck. You don’t stand a chance.

America First Policies, the president’s official Super PAC, gave Breitbart News on Monday an exclusive sneak peek at findings from its focus group work nationwide in the last month. The organization has now conducted 18 separate focus groups in nine different American cities since late October.

Those cities include Des Moines, Iowa, Orlando, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona, Miami, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. America First Policies has gathered 36 total hours of focus group data from the participants, all of whom are independents or swing voters in their respective cities.

The biggest takeaway from all the groups, including one in Pittsburgh thatwas conducted after the first House Intelligence Committee public impeachment hearing last Wednesday that featured State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent, is that swing voters are not being moved in the slightest against Trump by the impeachment narrative Democrats are offering.

America First Policies screened footage from these focus groups for Breitbart News at their headquarters just outside the nation’s capital on Monday afternoon, including the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, group that was filmed after that first Democrat impeachment hearing. When the moderator asked the room if anyone thinks Donald Trump should be impeached, not a single person in the room—all independents, most of whom do not like Trump’s personality—said they did.

After a moment of silence when the focus group conductor asked the room of independents if Trump should be impeached, a man finally said: “Not even close.”

The man continued when asked why the Democrats are pushing for impeachment:

This is their platform. This is all they got—and what they got is nothing. They want to keep to politics and Trump is not a politician. They are going to do everything they can because he bucked the system. He exposed what the draining the swamp and everything means. That’s the thing—they don’t even have anything close to valid. It’s just nothing. Instead of focusing on policies, they’re trying to do this to win the election.

When the moderator asks another man how House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has done handling the impeachment inquiry so far, he replies: “I don’t know because I can’t believe half of what the media puts out because they’re biased—and there’s been no proof on the table.”

“I’m not all Trump… I’m not a party voter,” that man continues. “But he calls it like it is. He’s a renegade… Do I respect the man? I don’t. But I respect the office. But I don’t see where they have enough to say he knew about it so…”

Up next was a woman, who said she is not a Trump supporter but thinks the president is getting railroaded:

I’m not a Trump supporter by any means, but I totally disagree with what they’re doing. I know he’s not perfect, but by the same coin he’s right there and he tells you how it is. I don’t agree with all of the things. But at least he’s trying to do things.

After that another woman and another man—both of whom are not Trump supporters—made the case that Democrats’ impeachment goals are meaningless because the Senate will clear Trump even if the House impeaches him.

“Sadly, I don’t feel—just because they’ll stick to party lines—that this will go anywhere,” the woman said.

“And they have to know that, so then you have to ask why they’re doing this,” the man added.

“Correct,” the woman concurred. “It’s just a waste of the taxpayers’ money.”

Another man said he thinks the Democrats are doing it so Trump “has an asterisk next to his name going into the next election.” He went on:

But another thing is I think it shows a weakness, or a lack of confidence, in the Democrat field and concern that their eventual candidate can’t beat Donald Trump. Otherwise, why would you be doing this a year out from the election?

This dismissal of impeachment was a consistent theme throughout the focus groups that America First Policies conducted throughout the country. Generally speaking, most of the focus groups—video from all of which Breitbart News reviewed in America First’s northern Virginia offices—had no supporters of even the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. The handful of those that did support an actual inquiry—because they want elected leaders like Trump to face scrutiny and they support investigations, not because they think he actually did anything wrong—certainly do not think there is enough evidence to impeach, never mind convict Trump and remove him from office.

A woman in the North Carolina focus group, for instance, said Democrats are “wasting a lot of time and money” pursuing Trump’s impeachment and should instead “get back to doing what they’re supposed to be doing, passing laws.”

A man in that group also summed up what independents are thinking, dismissing the Democrats’ impeachment agenda:

When the news of this first broke, I was sitting there thinking okay these are conversations that mostly went on and then you step back and look what they are—from what media outlet—and you go, okay, his personality is arrogant. We’ve all seen him say something stupid. However, on the flip side of that, all this secrecy—the smoke and mirrors—the unwillingness to unmask the whistleblower out of fears of safety. Come on. What are you hiding?

These sentiments on impeachment were not the only thing that America First’s focus groups uncovered. Another consistent theme is that while these independent swing voters like President Trump’s policies and what he’s accomplished for the country, they do not like his personality or his tweets.

Generally speaking, the swing voters wish Trump would tweet less attacks on opponents—and not say certain things sometimes. But they did also reveal that while the voters find Trump’s abrasive personality off-putting at times, they do like that he is a “street fighter” in the words of one and that he has exposed corruption in the federal government.

Perhaps most importantly for Trump, the voters do not see him as part of the political system—they do not consider Trump a “politician,” despite the fact he’s been in office for nearly three years now—and they still consider him an outsider or “renegade,” in the words of one Pittsburgh-area independent.

What’s more, America First’s focus groups also uncovered a lot of sentiment among independents about several of the top Democrat presidential candidates. Regarding former Vice President Joe Biden, top terms focus group participants used were “too old,” “forgetful,” and “Obama’s second hand.” They also described Biden as a “creep” who makes unwanted advances against young women and as “the swamp,” a sign that America First Policies officials believe demonstrates that attacks on Biden’s son Hunter Biden are breaking through to voters nationwide.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is described as a “socialist,” “outspoken,” a “liar,” and “academic.” Warren’s history of falsely claiming to be a Native American has broken through, as several of the independent voters in the focus groups across the country called Warren “Pocahontas.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, was described as “too old,” “angry,” “crazy,” and “socialist.”

Another interesting finding from these focus groups is that these independent voters do not see much of a difference between any of the Democrats, even when there are actual policy-specific nuances separating them. For instance, when former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke (D-TX) called for door-to-door gun confiscation and mandatory government-controlled buybacks of Americans’ firearms before he later dropped out of the presidential race, one woman in a North Carolina focus group expressed outrage at the whole Democrat field over it. She said:

“I watched ten minutes of the Democratic debate and when I heard somebody talking about taking your guns I thought ‘you just fucking killed yourself.’ What was he talking about when he was saying he was going to take our guns?”

“No way in hell are they getting our guns,” another woman said.

The woman did not use the name “Beto O’Rourke” when expressing her frustrations with Democrats on gun confiscation, but just broadly spoke of all the Democrats like this. America First Policies officials told Breitbart News that generally speaking on issues like gun confiscation, illegal immigration, and healthcare—particularly the backing of the government takeover of healthcare through “Medicare For All”—these focus group voters do not see much nuance between the different Democrats’ plans and policy visions, a problem for Democrats as swing voters are painting them all with a broad brush into radically leftist socialist positions.

What’s more, the only two Democrat candidates for president these focus group independent swing voters spoke highly of were Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and businessman Andrew Yang. The swing voters, the America First Policies officials told Breitbart News, like Gabbard’s military service and the fight she just got in with 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. As for Yang, they said, the voters are intrigued by his different kinds of ideas like the universal basic income idea."

Buttigieg was speaking at a Latino candidate forum after attending a convention of the state’s Democrats, whom he has been courting aggressively ahead of California’s March 3 primary, in Long Beach.

The Golden State, which has the largest delegate haul, has traditionally voted in June, but state leaders chose to shift it earlier to give voters a bigger role in determining the winner of presidential primaries.

Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn’t violate Mexico’s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn’t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically — do you see a time when troops can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation — as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partner south of the border.

Buttigieg seems to have missed the point of the question: that American lives are, in fact, on the line.

The Sacramento Bee reports that Buttigieg was the only candidate who faced a direct question about sending troops to Mexico.

Other candidates were sharply critical of Buttigieg’s remarks. Aggressive rhetoric about Mexico is taboo in the Democratic Party, ever since President Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on building a wall along the border — and making Mexico pay for it.

(Since then, Trump has ordered the military to build new portions of “wall” — heavy bollard fencing — along the border, over congressional objections, and secured an agreement with Mexico to place thousands of troops at its southern border, at its expense.)

Buttigieg remains in single digits in most nationwide polls, occupying fourth place, the first of the second-tier candidates, well behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the front of the pack. He is leading in recent polls in Iowa, however, and is focusing his resources in early primary states.

Meanwhile, delegates to the convention were reportedly suggesting that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) drop out, given that she is polling poorly in her own home state.

Harris has focused her campaign’s dwindling resources on Iowa, rather than on nearby Nevada, the third primary state, where she has a geographical advantage.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) signaled that she is open to a universal basic income – an idea that has been championed by fellow presidential contender Andrew Yang (D).

Warren expressed her willingness to consider a UBI, which quite literally amounts to the government handing individuals and families a “basic” income per month regardless of employment or income status, in a Washington Post survey that asked, “Should the federal government pay a universal basic income to every American adult?”

Three candidates were listed as supporting the measure – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Marianne Williamson (D), and Yang. Notably, two candidates were listed as “open to it” – Julián Castro (D) and Warren.

“We absolutely must raise wages and strengthen the social safety net so that every American has basic financial security. Universal basic income and universal living wages are options to consider,” Warren told the Post, noting her push for a $15 minimum wage.

She continued:

To raise wages, I have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, and empowering American workers at big American corporations to elect no less than 40 percent of the company board members — giving workers a powerful voice in corporate decisions about wages and benefits.

Her position is drastically different than Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT), who typically holds similar views to Warren. He has openly expressed skepticism of a universal basic income, contending that his federal jobs guarantee is better because “people want to work.”

“We take a very different approach from Mr. Yang and that is I believe in a jobs guarantee,” Sanders told Hill.TV in August.

He continued:

The challenge that we face is how do we use technology to improve the lives of working people. So if you have a really terrible job, a boring job and we make your job better and we enable you to work 20 hours a week rather than 40 hours a week, it’s not a bad thing…but it means to say you still need an income to live by, we can’t cut your salaries in half.

I asked @BernieSanders how he would deal with automation and why he believes a federal jobs guarantee is superior to UBI.

He repeated that sentiment to the Post:

Sanders believes that all Americans are entitled to economic rights. These include the right to a decent job with good pay, affordable housing, quality health care, a clean environment, and a secure retirement. We will guarantee a good-paying job to all Americans through a federal job guarantee program to ensure everyone has a decent quality of life. Furthermore, [Sanders] strongly supports the BOOST Act, introduced by Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib to guarantee all Americans an income.

Yang, a strong proponent of the measure, addressed Sanders’ critique.

“Bernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day,” he said.

“He also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government, which isn’t true,” Yang continued.

“It’s very strange – he seemed open and warm to the idea of a Universal Basic Income not too long ago,” he added. “Now he seems irritated every time it comes up”:

Yang has argued that a guaranteed income will “Americans will work even harder”:

However, numerous studies and experiments have idicated that a UBI does not necessarily leave recipients better off. The Washington Post analyzed the experiment on the small scale, in which a non-profit gave “20 African American single mothers living in public housing $1,000 each month for a year” with no strings attached. While the women were able to buy necessities, they also spent money on nonessentials, with one woman noting that she “blew all of it.”

Despite that, the Post did not necessarily deem the experiment a failure, blaming the lack of fruitful results on the participants’ “lack of ‘experience’ in handling discretionary income,” as Breitbart News reported."

Elizabeth Warren has promised that ""Medicare for All"" will not cost the middle class one penny more in taxes.

That vow, however, is possible largely because the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate asserts that creating a single-payer health insurance system will cost a whole lot less than many others think it will. That includes her fellow 2020 contender Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the bill.

Warren's financing estimate relies on being able to greatly curb health care spending -- more than is reasonably possible, some experts say.

Warren's campaign unveiled a financing plan earlier this month that pegged the cost of Medicare for All at $20.5 trillion over a decade, significantly lower than the $30-plus trillion estimates calculated by several think tanks and academics. While Sanders has not released a detailed financing plan or price tag, he has acknowledged it will likely cost north of $30 trillion.

Warren gets to the lower figure in two ways: She requires states and local governments to redirect the $6 trillion they now spend on health care to the federal government to help foot the bill. But her plan also depends heavily on cutting administrative expenses, prescription drug prices and reimbursements to hospitals and doctors, as well as slowing the overall growth rate of health care spending.

Some policy experts question whether all those costs could actually be wrung out of the nation's health care system. It matters because if it doesn't happen, then Warren would need to raise even more money in taxes -- possibly having to turn to the middle class.

""The shortfall would be in the trillions of dollars if those assumptions perform the way most people think they'll perform,"" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank.

To finance Medicare for All, Warren calls for increasing taxes on the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations, as well as requiring employers to contribute. Some experts also doubt whether these levies would raise the amounts she projects.

Warren worked with two prominent experts to develop the $20.5 trillion cost estimate. They reviewed seven previous single-payer cost analyses, but also incorporated other studies and the experiences in other developed countries.

""I stand by the estimates that we came up with. They were in no cases extreme,"" said Don Berwick, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration. ""They were estimates based on the evidence we had.""

The Warren campaign pointed to the 24-page analysis by ""leading experts"" such as Berwick that backs up the policy choices the senator made beyond the Medicare for All Act.

""Every policy choice is validated by robust empirical research, supported by experts, and grounded in real data,"" said spokeswoman Saloni Sharma. She pointed to two other academic studies that had lower cost estimates than Warren's. ""People who disagree with the numbers should show us theirs.""

Here are four big spending assumptions contained in Warren's plan:

Slashing administrative costs: The US shells out far more than other countries in this area, in part because it has multiple payers, including private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid. Private insurers spend 12.2% of premiums collected on administrative costs, while Medicare spends 2.3%, according to federal data.

Warren would set Medicare for All administrative spending at 2.3%, which would save $1.8 trillion over a decade, according to the analysis by Berwick and Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.

That spending rate is too low for experts at the Urban Institute, who recently published an analysis of a Medicare for All-type plan that pegged the cost at $34 trillion over a decade. They consider 6% to be more reasonable because, as the sole payer, the federal government will have to invest in managing care, monitoring quality and access and preventing fraud and abuse.

""Medicare doesn't do a lot to monitor utilization and to try to control spending,"" said John Holahan, an institute fellow at Urban Institute and one of the analysis' authors. ""In a system like [Medicare for All], where everything is free, I think you are going to have to do a lot more of that.""

Reforming prescription drug pricing: Warren has outlined some aggressive cost reduction targets -- seeking to bring down Medicare prices for brand-name drugs by 70% and for generic medications by 30% from current levels. She would do this mainly by allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices and by overriding patents or providing public support to manufacture the drugs if bargaining fails.

The senator's plan bears some similarities to the prescription drug price bill making its way through the House and backed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But it would set a lower price than the House bill and eliminate the limit on the number of drugs subject to negotiation every year, among other changes.

The Urban analysis had estimated a roughly 30% reduction in prescription drug prices, which it thought had a better shot of getting through Congress and the influential pharmaceutical lobbyists. As it is, the House bill has divided progressive and moderate Democrats, which has delayed bringing it to the floor for a vote. It's considered dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Overall, Warren's prescription drug reform plan would save $1.7 trillion over a decade, according to the analysis done for her campaign.

Reducing payments to hospitals and doctors: Warren proposes drastically Warren proposes drastically cutting reimbursement rates for many providers.

She would pay hospitals an average of 110% of Medicare rates, which she said would cover their current cost of caring for patients. She argues that hospitals will still come out ahead because their administrative and drug expenses would be lower and because everyone would have insurance -- meaning fewer non-paying consumers.

Doctors, meanwhile, would be paid at current Medicare rates, though Warren would increase reimbursements for primary care doctors and lower them for certain specialists, whom she called ""overpaid."" Physicians would also benefit since they would spend less time on billing and dealing with insurance companies, she said.

These rates would be a big haircut from those paid by private insurers, though it would be a bump up from Medicaid reimbursement. So just how it affects providers would depend on their mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients. This, along with other payment reforms, would save $2.9 trillion over a decade.

Still, the powerful hospital and physician groups would fight such a change in reimbursements. For instance, when devising a state-run public insurance option earlier this year, Washington lawmakers wound up capping payments at an average of 160% of Medicare rates, instead of just Medicare rates, after an outcry from the industry. That reduced projected premium savings to only 5% to 10%, instead of 40%.

""These [Medicare] rates are simply so punishing to doctors, nurses and hospital employees compared to private insurance that there will be revolt among the medical profession,"" Kessler said. ""So there will either be an expensive rollback or demonstrations in the street.""

Slowing health care spending growth: Overall, Warren's proposal would lower the rate of health care spending growth in the US so that it falls in line with overall economic growth, according to the analysis done for the campaign. This would save $1.1 trillion over a decade.

That will be possible in part because currently about one-third of the spending -- roughly $1 trillion -- is low value, Berwick said. That gives the US a lot of opportunity to eliminate these wasteful expenditures under Medicare for All.

But other experts doubt that will be possible.

""To get down to GDP growth is not something we've ever done in this country,"" Holahan said."

Barkan, who is dying of ALS after being diagnosed in 2016, has emerged over the last few years as one of the leading health care activists in the country, incorporating his own story into a broader appeal for a massive overhaul of the American health care system.

During this Democratic primary campaign, nearly all of the party's leading candidates have made the journey to California, where Barkan lives with his wife and two children, to discuss the issue in a series of taped interviews.

In the past month, as Warren first unveiled her proposal to finance Medicare for All and, more recently, with the release of her transition plan, Barkan has backed her over the concerns of some fellow activists.

""We can and should talk about our strategy and our tactics,"" he wrote in an op-ed published early Wednesday by The Nation . ""But what matters most to me is that Elizabeth Warren is all in for Medicare for All . Her plan says clearly that by the end of her first term everyone will have comprehensive guaranteed Medicare -- whether you are rich or poor, young or old; that there will be no co-pays, premiums or deductibles; and that we will bring down the costs of healthcare because private insurance companies will no longer be able to put profit over patients.""

Warren in a statement thanked Barkan for his endorsement.

""I'm deeply grateful to have Ady Barkan's support in this fight,"" she said. ""I'm making a promise to Ady, his family, and every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. We're going to do this together.""

This past spring, Barkan testified at the first congressional hearings on Medicare for All.

""Some people argue that although Medicare for All is a great idea, we need to move slowly to get there,"" he said during a now-rare trip to Washington. ""But I needed Medicare for All yesterday. Millions of people need it today. The time to pass this law is now.""

But Barkan's relationship with Warren traces back further than the current election cycle. In 2012, he launched a pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, calling for it to prioritize employment and wage growth over concerns about inflation.

""I've worked with Elizabeth since before I was sick,"" Barkan recalled. ""She was a key partner for the Fed Up campaign, an effort I led to demand that the Federal Reserve use monetary policy as a vehicle for good, instead of as a handout to Goldman Sachs.""

Warren sat with Barkan earlier this year to discuss the issue, a conversation that pushed Warren deeper into the ideological weeds of the debate than she had previously gone. Asked by Barkan how she ultimately squared her support for Medicare for All -- which would effectively ban private health insurance -- with her defense of well-regulated private markets, Warren offered what progressives considered a notable concession.

""There are areas where markets just don't work and a big part of health care is one of those. So the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will all sort itself out is just not true with health care,"" Warren said. ""I get financial decisions over whether you're gonna to be able to get a new car or what it looks like, but not financial decisions at the heart of basic health care. Medicare for All, it's about a relationship that all of us as Americans have to each other.""

Last week, Warren put out her new plan to transition the country to Medicare for All, first by using the Senate budget reconciliation process to pass legislation that would immediately offer Medicare for All's full suite of benefits -- at no cost -- to children under 18 and people at up to 200% of the poverty level, around $51,000 in income for a family of four. The option would be open to any American who wants to use it, but they would have to pay for it, though costs would decline over time. Additionally, the legislation would lower the current Medicare eligibility age to 50 from 65, while also expanding the program's benefits and lowering prices for enrollees.

But a full push to move to Medicare for All, she said, would only come after the first piece was implemented and had a chance to take hold. Warren has pledged to finish the transition before the end of her first term in office. Amid some criticism suggesting Warren was checking her support for the policy, Barkan defended her.

""Today, @ewarren laid out a plan to get 100 million ppl onto Medicare in first 100 days, via exec action & 51-vote reconciliation,"" he tweeted last week. ""And to use that victory to win midterms & show America that M4A is a great+workable. It's a damn smart plan. And by now, that should surprise no one.""

In his piece in The Nation explaining why he would vote for Warren in the California primary, Barkan also makes clear his fond feelings and support for Bernie Sanders , the Vermont independent senator who wrote and popularized the Medicare for All legislation.

""For progressives like me -- and maybe you -- the choice in this primary is between Elizabeth and Bernie. It is a difficult and wonderful choice to have,"" Barkan wrote. ""I believe that either one of them would be the best, most progressive president in modern US history."""

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants a wealth tax. She says she needs it to fund massive new government spending ventures that include clean energy, affordable housing, Social Security benefits, universal childcare, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation, free college and Medicare for All. She also believes a wealth tax is needed because rising income inequality generally has a negative effect on the economy.

She's half right.

Rising income inequality is indeed a problem for economic growth. But taxing wealth could exacerbate the problem, not fix it. That's because the bulk of the wealth Warren is counting on to pay the bills is not sitting under a mattress. Instead, America's wealthiest men and women often invest in new business capital, resulting in innovation and jobs that American consumers and workers largely benefit from.

Warren wants to enact a tax of 2% per year on household wealth above $50 million, with an additional 1% levy on wealth above $1 billion. Since most of the estimated wealth of billionaires is invested in companies that innovate and create jobs, Warren's wealth tax could — if it successfully seizes a large amount of assets from the world's best allocators of capital — lead to less investment, ultimately harming workers and consumers.

Economist Larry Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary who advised presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, has stated publicly — and repeatedly — that one of the many reasons wealth taxes fail is due to much higher tax avoidance and tax evasion than the 15% estimated by Warren's economic advisers. They had estimated that the super-wealthy already tend to understate their wealth to avoid taxes by roughly 15%, but as numerous economists, including Summers, pointed out, the rate of tax avoidance would be much higher since tax avoidance is an increasing function of the tax rate. That means that at higher tax rates, tax avoidance would also increase.

But more importantly, there's also a question of how a wealth tax would affect economic growth.

The economy grows when people put money back into it. It grows even faster when capital flows freely into great ideas and new projects. America continues to lead the world in patent filings because of the investments of wealthy American investors.

Has a wealth tax ever been an effective means of promoting economic growth? France — a country that had a wealth tax until 2017 — proves that the tax is a massive risk.

Eric Pichet, a professor of economics, estimated the costs of the wealth tax in France: Capital flight amounted to over $200 billion, an annual fiscal shortfall of almost $7 billion — or about twice the revenue it generated — as well as a reduction in GDP growth of $3.5 billion per year. It's estimated that France's wealth tax led to the exodus of 10,000 millionaires in 2015 alone . President Emmanuel Macron ended the country's wealth tax in 2017 because of the havoc it wreaked on the French economy.

Sure, some ultra-rich Americans made their money by inheriting it. But most billionaires are self-made . They worked hard and invested. They're not hoarders — they're actually infusing massive amounts of money into the American economy and creating jobs. A wealth tax could drastically reduce those investments.

We have to consider what we, as a country, want our public policy to encourage. We shouldn't be taxing ownership, industriousness and hard work. As a country, we should shift away from taxing income and we should never discourage investment and ownership. There is no surer way out of poverty and up the economic ladder than via the accumulation of human and physical capital.

There is a better model — taxing consumption, not income or wealth. Laurence Kotlikoff, a leading economist at Boston University, suggests taxes should not penalize investments that make good-paying jobs a reality. Instead of taxing wealth, Kotlikoff wants to tax how much the rich consume; income-in minus investment-out equals consumption. Under this plan, billionaire investors would pay lower taxes than billionaires who spend lavishly on private jets and mega yachts. Under Kotlikoff's plan , only consumption in excess of $100,000 would be taxed at rates that rise from 0% to 30%.

Taxing consumption makes sense for many reasons. For one thing, it encourages new investments. These new investments would make workers more productive, improve living standards and grow the economy.

A consumption tax is easier to enforce, too. A wealth tax includes everything you own, such as money in the bank, along with property and everything in it, such as expensive paintings for example, making the tax base difficult to estimate.

Currently, the US tax code favors different types of income over others, creating loopholes that have exacerbated the gap between the rich and the poor. Shifting away from an income tax toward a consumption tax would simplify our federal tax code while making sure it doesn't contribute to rising income inequality. Eliminating progressive income taxes in favor of taxing consumption on a cash-flow basis, is fair, easy to enforce and would help sustain higher rates of economic growth and it would be less costly to enforce and nearly impossible for the rich to evade, as the IRS already tracks income and investments. Consumption is whatever is left over, so it can easily be taxed.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a lawyer and entrepreneur from upstate New York, has pointed out that other countries such as France, Sweden, Germany and Denmark have all adopted a wealth tax, only to repeal the policy shortly afterward.

""If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?"" Yang asked on stage at the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate.

Yang's right. We don't have to repeat public policy failures. We can learn from others' mistakes and simplify the federal tax code to slow the growth in income inequality and continue to improve the nation's economy, attracting more workers to good paying jobs."

Wilson Professor of Enterprise and Leadership and Professor of Economics at Grinnell College. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

I'm a registered Democrat in Iowa, where I have taught economics for more than 40 years. About once a week, some Democratic candidate campaigning for the fast-approaching caucuses shows up at a coffee shop or restaurant in my little prairie town seeking the support of me and my neighbors. Every couple of days, I get a text or a phone call from the local staff of Bernie, Cory or Mayor Pete, asking who I will caucus for in February.

For me, all this attention from the Democrats conjures up some uncomfortable questions: Am I really a Democrat, or just pretending to be one? Can I, as an economist, focus on the things that I like about the Democratic hopefuls, and ignore the things that bother me?

Take Trump's tariffs, for example. Why don't the candidates all propose to scupper the tariffs? Trump's trade war makes investors reluctant to invest because they create an uncertain business climate. As an economist, I know that shrinking investment is a recipe for recession. The new president could eliminate the tariffs on the first day on the job. Yet no one standing on the debate stage seemed eager to suggest this.

Why not? One reason is that labor unions traditionally favor protective tariffs since they want to boost American manufacturing, and Democrats traditionally avoid irritating labor unions. Unionized workers have tended to support the Democratic party.

The actual impact of tariffs is widely misunderstood by the general population. Trump calls the trade deficit with China a form of theft, and many Americans agree that China has been engaging in unfair trade practices. Economists, on the other hand, see it more like a gift — if China sends us shirts, shoes and semiconductors in exchange for money, which they then loan back to us by buying Treasury bills, why don't we consider that a good deal? If the Chinese government were to stop buying up the dollars and loaning them to us, that would indeed help American producers, but it would impose higher prices of imports on American consumers.

But it is their plans to hike payroll taxes that would have the biggest impact on voters.

Elizabeth Warren and other leading Democrats have said that they would impose a stiff payroll tax hike on higher-income families. In Warren’s proposal, she would impose a 14.8 percent payroll tax on workers with incomes above $250,000.

Currently, Social Security payroll taxes amount to 12.4 percent for incomes up to $132,900. Incomes above that level are not taxed and do not contribute to a worker’s future Social Security benefits.

Warren’s plan would have the tax kick back in on incomes above $250,000. And the rate would rise to 14.8 percent. Like the current tax, this would be split between the employee and the employer.

If the wealth tax is a “billionaires tax,” this would be a “hundred-thousandaires tax.” It would hit the pocketbooks of around 5 million households.

The tax on higher incomes would not result in higher benefits. Breaking with its roots as an earned entitlement, Social Security would become a wealth transfer system.

“The result would be a large tax increase on high earners, even before other changes a Democratic administration might contemplate, such as increasing income tax rates or taxes on investment income,” New York Times writer Neil Irwin explains. “The top earners facing new Social Security taxes would not see their future benefits rise commensurately; rather it would amount to a transfer from high earners to low- and middle-income Social Security recipients.”

This could cause some political trouble for Warren and other advocates of payroll tax hikes because the higher taxes would be paid disproportionately in Democratic-leaning states, according to data from Moody’s. Irwin describes the tax proposals as “a test of what affluent liberals are willing to sacrifice to accomplish progressive goals.”

According to Warren’s tax plans, high-income households would also be hit by a 14.8 percent tax on investment incomes. This tax would apply to individuals with incomes above $250,000 or households with incomes above $400,000."

A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina. Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent.

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively.

Biden’s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was “safe,” while 55 percent said the former vice president was “down to earth.” A further 71 percent believed Biden’s policy stances were “about right for defeating [President] Donald Trump” in 2020.

Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as “risky” by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist.

The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points.

Biden’s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent survey from Monmouth Poll estimated that more than six-in-ten of South Carolina’s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020.

Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates’ level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president’s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux.

In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter’s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president’s political position. Biden’s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs.

As Biden’s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg’s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor’s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina.

Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor’s speeches.

Another likely late entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend “whatever it takes” to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor’s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he’s already running.

As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president’s position in South Carolina.

When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg’s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn’t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey."

For president?

Because what people are looking for today as an alternative to the current occupant of the White House is a massively wealthy, arrogant New York City billionaire with his own fleet of private jets.

The only intelligent thing about Mr. Bloomberg running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency is what it says about the present crop of Democrats running for the nomination. They’re a hopeless bunch of losers who would rather destroy America than lose another election to President Trump.

Mr. Bloomberg isn’t really even a Democrat. He is whatever he needs to be at any given moment.

He was a Democrat. Then a Republican. Then an independent. Now he is a Democrat again.

And the only reason his candidacy is being pushed at the moment is that supposed Democrat “front-runner” Joseph R. Biden has defecated in his own bed and his son has wound up being perhaps the only criminal actor in the Democrats’ whole Ukraine impeachment crusade.

That, and the fact that Mr. Biden has been running for president for about 45 years and — STILL — nobody wants him. The former vice president’s sputtering campaign has opened the door to candidates with truly crazy socialist agendas, such as Elizabeth Warren.

Everybody knows Ms. Warren will be bad news for billionaires, perhaps the only slightly appealing thing about her. So the Forbes 500 list got together and came up with the perfect candidate to thwart the Warren campaign and take on Donald Trump.

Please, can you imagine Little Michael Bloomberg filling an arena in Milwaukee with thousands and thousands of screaming fans?

But this is the funniest thing about a Bloomberg campaign.

One of the oldest and biggest complaints about President Trump is his supposed arrogance. I would argue that Mr. Trump is actually a marvelously self-deprecating — yet thoroughly confident — politician. So much so that he revels in people’s fear that he is some kind of unstoppable dictator. He will NEVER relinquish the White House peacefully. He will run in 2020. And then in 2024. And 2028.

He openly jokes about this partly to remind voters of his fairly incredible stamina — as if Mr. Trump really might run for president at the age of 112.

But the joke is also meant to torment those stupid enough to take it seriously.

Which brings us back to Mr. Bloomberg. Who served THREE terms as mayor of a city that had a strict TWO-term limit on mayors.

But not for Little Mike. He had the law changed for himself so that he really could blow the term limit meant for politicians.

Good luck. You don’t stand a chance.

For the first time, President Trump is taking the lead ahead of four top Democrat candidates in potential head to head match-ups, according to a Wednesday poll conducted by Marquette University Law School.

According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed.

“We don’t know how this story is going to end,” said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. “At the moment just over half think there was an ask.”

It was also noted that in October — before the public testimony began — the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed.

When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the margin of error), which turns the tables from August’s survey results that showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent.

As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by 48 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent.

“Call it a small advantage to Trump,” said Franklin.

The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not.

With regards to whether or not the president’s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong.

The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

Elizabeth Warren's introductory ""Medicare for All"" option looks similar to the proposals championed by former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

All three would offer government-run health insurance options on the Affordable Care Act exchanges that would compete with private insurance plans. All would allow those with employer-sponsored policies to sign up for the public plan. All promise to make the coverage more affordable. And all would automatically enroll low-income Americans in coverage.

But Warren's proposal , and what it would offer Americans, is significantly different from those of her more moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

To start, it would be the first step toward adopting a government-run Medicare for All system in the US, which is Sen. Bernie Sanders' brainchild. Also, her option is far more generous and is aimed at building support for full universal coverage by quickly immersing tens of millions of Americans in Medicare for All.

""It looks like a very substantial down payment on Medicare for All,"" said Chris Jennings, a health policy expert and former official in the Clinton and Obama administrations. ""It may be more than halfway there.""

The risk for Warren is that her new plan is unlikely to blunt attacks from either Biden or Buttigieg , while inviting new skepticism from some on the left, who had previously questioned her commitment to Sanders' Medicare for All bill. Hours after the release of Warren's proposed ""transition"" this month, Sanders announced that, if elected, he would bring up the full legislation during his ""first week in office"" -- striking an indirect but unmistakable contrast with his longtime progressive ally.

Sanders' transition plan, which he first introduced in 2017, would, in its first year, place every American 55 or older, along with people up to age 18, into his version of the Medicare for All program. People would also have the option to buy in immediately. Over the next two years, according to the current bill's language, the Medicare for All enrollment age would drop to 45, then 35. By the fourth year, everyone would be covered.

Buttigieg's emergence as the front-runner in Iowa means his own proposal is about to come under increased scrutiny. Buttigieg's plan, which he describes as ""Medicare for all who want it,"" is a thinner version of what Warren is planning to do off the bat, and neither the South Bend mayor nor Biden has drawn up a clear path to universal coverage -- a priority for almost every Democrat running in the primary.

Here are some notable ways the leading primary contenders' plans differ:

How much people have to pay

Biden and Buttigieg aim to expand coverage in part by enhancing federal premium subsidies -- both for those currently eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those who now earn too much for assistance.

They would provide access to premium subsidies to everyone buying insurance on the exchanges. Under Obamacare, only those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $50,000 for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four, qualify for federal help.

Those subsidies would be used to cap premiums at a maximum of 8.5% of income, rather than roughly 10% under Obamacare. And Biden and Buttigieg would tie the premium subsidies to more generous gold plans -- which have lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs -- rather than silver policies so enrollees would spend less when they visit the doctor or a hospital.

And Buttigieg would allow those with access to employer coverage to buy policies on the Obamacare exchange and receive federal subsidies, while Biden would open up the subsidies to workers who select the public option. Currently, those with affordable policies at their jobs don't qualify for Obamacare subsides.

Also, Biden and Buttigieg would automatically enroll uninsured, low-income Americans either in the public option or in Medicaid, depending on whether their state expanded Medicaid to those making less than 138% of the poverty level, or roughly $17,250 for an individual or $35,550 for a family of four.

Buttigieg also wants to create a fund that would reimburse health care providers for caring for the uninsured. Those lacking coverage would be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Warren's option, which she is proposing to pass in the first 100 days of her administration, would have no monthly premium for children under 18 and people below 200% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $25,000 for an individual and $51,500 for a family of four.

For everyone else, premiums would be capped at 5% of income -- making her option cheaper and, in theory, more attractive as she seeks to build public support for a full transition to Medicare for All.

Plus, deductibles wouldn't exist in Warren's plan. Children and those earning less than twice the poverty level would have no out-of-pocket costs for care. Others would have to pay something, though it would be capped.

Over time, premiums and cost-sharing would gradually decrease to zero.

What benefits enrollees would receive

The public option plans envisioned by Biden and Buttigieg would provide the same broad coverage as the policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges today. Obamacare requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, including mental health, prescription drugs and maternity, at a minimum.

Warren's option would be even more comprehensive, providing the same benefits as the Medicare for All bill introduced by Sanders, who is committed to passing his legislation in one shot. It would cover vision, dental, hearing aids and some long-term care.

How much it will cost

Biden says his plan would cost roughly $750 billion over 10 years, which he would pay for by raising the top marginal tax rate and the rate on capital gains for the wealthy. Buttigieg's proposal would come in at $1.5 trillion over a decade, which he would cover by rolling back President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and through cost savings from allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

Warren hasn't specified the cost of the first step of her plan. However, her campaign said it would be ""significantly higher"" than her rivals' proposals but less than the $11 trillion Americans are expected to shell out for health care over the next decade."

Pete Buttigieg defend his level of experience on Wednesday in contentious exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, using the debate to argue “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.”

The most contentious point of Buttigieg’s defense came when the mayor said, “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country.”

Buttigieg’s experience – he leads a city of just over 100,000 people, has only ever been elected by a few voters thousand and lost his only statewide election – has been a central question about his candidacy. And it was clear on Wednesday that his competitors came into the debate looking to questions his qualifications.

When Buttigieg mentioned voting rights, Klobuchar jumped in and said the issue is a “good example of where (Buttigieg) has said the right words” but not followed it up with action and called the mayor a “local official.”

“I have actually done this work,” Klobuchar said.

Buttigieg fired back.

“Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said, nodding not only his time as mayor, but his experience as a war veteran.

“I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late,” Buttigieg said.

Then Gabbard jumped and said Buttigieg showed a lack of judgment when he suggested using the U.S. military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.

“That is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics, Buttigieg responded. “Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? … I’m talking about building alliances.”

The mayor then hit Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“Let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad,” Buttigieg said.

Gabbard responded by noting how past leaders met with opposing leaders, citing when President John F. Kennedy met with Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev and former President Franklin Roosevelt met with Russian leader Joseph Stalin.

Buttigieg interrupted, “Like Donald Trump who met with Kim,” a nod to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un."

Barkan, who is dying of ALS after being diagnosed in 2016, has emerged over the last few years as one of the leading health care activists in the country, incorporating his own story into a broader appeal for a massive overhaul of the American health care system.

During this Democratic primary campaign, nearly all of the party's leading candidates have made the journey to California, where Barkan lives with his wife and two children, to discuss the issue in a series of taped interviews.

In the past month, as Warren first unveiled her proposal to finance Medicare for All and, more recently, with the release of her transition plan, Barkan has backed her over the concerns of some fellow activists.

""We can and should talk about our strategy and our tactics,"" he wrote in an op-ed published early Wednesday by The Nation . ""But what matters most to me is that Elizabeth Warren is all in for Medicare for All . Her plan says clearly that by the end of her first term everyone will have comprehensive guaranteed Medicare -- whether you are rich or poor, young or old; that there will be no co-pays, premiums or deductibles; and that we will bring down the costs of healthcare because private insurance companies will no longer be able to put profit over patients.""

Warren in a statement thanked Barkan for his endorsement.

""I'm deeply grateful to have Ady Barkan's support in this fight,"" she said. ""I'm making a promise to Ady, his family, and every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. We're going to do this together.""

This past spring, Barkan testified at the first congressional hearings on Medicare for All.

""Some people argue that although Medicare for All is a great idea, we need to move slowly to get there,"" he said during a now-rare trip to Washington. ""But I needed Medicare for All yesterday. Millions of people need it today. The time to pass this law is now.""

But Barkan's relationship with Warren traces back further than the current election cycle. In 2012, he launched a pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, calling for it to prioritize employment and wage growth over concerns about inflation.

""I've worked with Elizabeth since before I was sick,"" Barkan recalled. ""She was a key partner for the Fed Up campaign, an effort I led to demand that the Federal Reserve use monetary policy as a vehicle for good, instead of as a handout to Goldman Sachs.""

Warren sat with Barkan earlier this year to discuss the issue, a conversation that pushed Warren deeper into the ideological weeds of the debate than she had previously gone. Asked by Barkan how she ultimately squared her support for Medicare for All -- which would effectively ban private health insurance -- with her defense of well-regulated private markets, Warren offered what progressives considered a notable concession.

""There are areas where markets just don't work and a big part of health care is one of those. So the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will all sort itself out is just not true with health care,"" Warren said. ""I get financial decisions over whether you're gonna to be able to get a new car or what it looks like, but not financial decisions at the heart of basic health care. Medicare for All, it's about a relationship that all of us as Americans have to each other.""

Last week, Warren put out her new plan to transition the country to Medicare for All, first by using the Senate budget reconciliation process to pass legislation that would immediately offer Medicare for All's full suite of benefits -- at no cost -- to children under 18 and people at up to 200% of the poverty level, around $51,000 in income for a family of four. The option would be open to any American who wants to use it, but they would have to pay for it, though costs would decline over time. Additionally, the legislation would lower the current Medicare eligibility age to 50 from 65, while also expanding the program's benefits and lowering prices for enrollees.

But a full push to move to Medicare for All, she said, would only come after the first piece was implemented and had a chance to take hold. Warren has pledged to finish the transition before the end of her first term in office. Amid some criticism suggesting Warren was checking her support for the policy, Barkan defended her.

""Today, @ewarren laid out a plan to get 100 million ppl onto Medicare in first 100 days, via exec action & 51-vote reconciliation,"" he tweeted last week. ""And to use that victory to win midterms & show America that M4A is a great+workable. It's a damn smart plan. And by now, that should surprise no one.""

In his piece in The Nation explaining why he would vote for Warren in the California primary, Barkan also makes clear his fond feelings and support for Bernie Sanders , the Vermont independent senator who wrote and popularized the Medicare for All legislation.

""For progressives like me -- and maybe you -- the choice in this primary is between Elizabeth and Bernie. It is a difficult and wonderful choice to have,"" Barkan wrote. ""I believe that either one of them would be the best, most progressive president in modern US history."""

Since the last debate, three candidates have suspended their campaigns: former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also launched a late-entry presidential bid, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is now considering getting into the race. These moves signal the Democratic primary race continues to be unsettled 75 days out from Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.

How was the stage decided?

The DNC has progressively raised the qualifying thresholds for the primary Democratic debates that began in June. In order to make the November stage, candidates had to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved national or early state polls or at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Candidates also had to raise money from 165,000 separate donors, including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

The most significant change is that it will restrict how political ads can be targeted on its platforms.

As the 2020 US presidential election approaches, how online platforms will deal with misinformation and outright false claims by politicians has become a hot-button issue. Google — which has taken in tens of millions of dollars in political advertising in the United States since last year — has been until now notably quiet in the debate surrounding how online platforms handle political ads.

President Donald Trump's reelection campaign ran an ad in October on Google-owned platform YouTube that falsely accused former Vice President Joe Biden of corruption for his role in Ukraine policy during the Obama administration.

A Google spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business on Wednesday that the ad would still be allowed to run on Google's platforms.

This stance comes even as Scott Spencer, a Google vice president, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday, ""It's against our policies for any advertiser to make a false claim — whether it's a claim about the price of a chair or a claim that you can vote by text message, that election day is postponed, or that a candidate has died.""

PBS NewsHour is partnering with Politico to produce the debate on December 19 from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. At least six Democrats have qualified to participate: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Candidates have until December 12 to meet the qualifying criteria established by the Democratic National Committee and its partners to receive an invitation to the debate.

The debate comes during tumultuous times in US history, shaped by ongoing presidential impeachment proceedings in Washington, and a country deeply divided along ideological lines.

The House impeachment proceedings are expected to continue through December, and if the House impeaches President Donald Trump, the Senate will likely take it up in January. Six of the Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination currently serve as US senators and will need to be in Washington if the Senate convenes a trial. This will make the December debate even more critical as it could be the last time these candidates will have a national stage until the next debate in January.

Wilson Professor of Enterprise and Leadership and Professor of Economics at Grinnell College. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

I'm a registered Democrat in Iowa, where I have taught economics for more than 40 years. About once a week, some Democratic candidate campaigning for the fast-approaching caucuses shows up at a coffee shop or restaurant in my little prairie town seeking the support of me and my neighbors. Every couple of days, I get a text or a phone call from the local staff of Bernie, Cory or Mayor Pete, asking who I will caucus for in February.

For me, all this attention from the Democrats conjures up some uncomfortable questions: Am I really a Democrat, or just pretending to be one? Can I, as an economist, focus on the things that I like about the Democratic hopefuls, and ignore the things that bother me?

Take Trump's tariffs, for example. Why don't the candidates all propose to scupper the tariffs? Trump's trade war makes investors reluctant to invest because they create an uncertain business climate. As an economist, I know that shrinking investment is a recipe for recession. The new president could eliminate the tariffs on the first day on the job. Yet no one standing on the debate stage seemed eager to suggest this.

Why not? One reason is that labor unions traditionally favor protective tariffs since they want to boost American manufacturing, and Democrats traditionally avoid irritating labor unions. Unionized workers have tended to support the Democratic party.

The actual impact of tariffs is widely misunderstood by the general population. Trump calls the trade deficit with China a form of theft, and many Americans agree that China has been engaging in unfair trade practices. Economists, on the other hand, see it more like a gift — if China sends us shirts, shoes and semiconductors in exchange for money, which they then loan back to us by buying Treasury bills, why don't we consider that a good deal? If the Chinese government were to stop buying up the dollars and loaning them to us, that would indeed help American producers, but it would impose higher prices of imports on American consumers.

But it is their plans to hike payroll taxes that would have the biggest impact on voters.

Elizabeth Warren and other leading Democrats have said that they would impose a stiff payroll tax hike on higher-income families. In Warren’s proposal, she would impose a 14.8 percent payroll tax on workers with incomes above $250,000.

Currently, Social Security payroll taxes amount to 12.4 percent for incomes up to $132,900. Incomes above that level are not taxed and do not contribute to a worker’s future Social Security benefits.

Warren’s plan would have the tax kick back in on incomes above $250,000. And the rate would rise to 14.8 percent. Like the current tax, this would be split between the employee and the employer.

If the wealth tax is a “billionaires tax,” this would be a “hundred-thousandaires tax.” It would hit the pocketbooks of around 5 million households.

The tax on higher incomes would not result in higher benefits. Breaking with its roots as an earned entitlement, Social Security would become a wealth transfer system.

“The result would be a large tax increase on high earners, even before other changes a Democratic administration might contemplate, such as increasing income tax rates or taxes on investment income,” New York Times writer Neil Irwin explains. “The top earners facing new Social Security taxes would not see their future benefits rise commensurately; rather it would amount to a transfer from high earners to low- and middle-income Social Security recipients.”

This could cause some political trouble for Warren and other advocates of payroll tax hikes because the higher taxes would be paid disproportionately in Democratic-leaning states, according to data from Moody’s. Irwin describes the tax proposals as “a test of what affluent liberals are willing to sacrifice to accomplish progressive goals.”

According to Warren’s tax plans, high-income households would also be hit by a 14.8 percent tax on investment incomes. This tax would apply to individuals with incomes above $250,000 or households with incomes above $400,000."

“The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border,” Warren said. “Trump is the one who has created this crisis. … When I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border.”

“There’s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys,” Warren said. “A great nation does not separate children from their families.”

As Breitbart News has chronicled, migrants are more often than not brutalized while making their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. In a recent case, a federal immigration official said a pregnant migrant — saved by Border Patrol agents — was beaten by cartel smugglers because she did not pay her debt.

After Border Patrol agents took her to a nearby hospital, the woman was treated for her injuries, while her child died as a result of the beating.

Mexican drug cartels have profited billions from America’s open border through the drug trade and human trafficking, increasing their power in Mexico.

Since 2009, there have been more than 250,000 homicides in Mexico and at least 30,000 disappearances. In 2017, there were 26,573 murders, 1,275 kidnappings, and 5,357 extortion cases in Mexico, marking the bloodiest year in the country in 20 years, despite these figures not capturing the scope of the cartel violence occurring in Mexico.

For Americans, the illegal immigration crisis is very real. In the last year alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested more than 6,600 convicted murderers and convicted sex offenders who were in the United States illegally. Of that total, 4,975 of the illegal aliens arrested were convicted sex offenders. The other 1,641 illegal aliens had been convicted of homicide.

Another 1,913 illegal aliens that were arrested by ICE had pending sex offense charges against them, while 387 illegal aliens had pending murder charges against them. For each one of these crimes, there are at least one or more American and legal immigrant victims.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday evening said she will try to persuade Republicans in the Senate to convict President Trump if the impeachment inquiry moves to a trial in the Senate.

Warren falsely claimed the president broke the law “again and again and again,” citing the Mueller report that found no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, a moderator of Wednesday’s Democrat debate, kicked off the evening by asking Warren if she will attempt to convince her Republican colleagues in the Senate to convict Trump.

“Of course I will,” Warren stated. “The obvious answer is to say first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it. That shows you how the president tried to obstruct justice,” she said, contending that Trump felt free to break the law “again and again and again, and that’s what’s happened with Ukraine.”

“We have to have to establish the principle no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it,” she said.

However, Warren’s claim that the Mueller report showed clear obstruction of justice is false, as former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not make a determination. Attorney General William Barr ultimately concluded that “the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”

Mueller told lawmakers over the summer:

I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. [Ted Lieu (D-CA] — who said, and I quote, ‘You didn’t charge the president because of the [Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)] opinion.’ That is not the correct way to say it.

“As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,” he added.

Additionally, Warren’s claim that the president broke the law “again and again and again” – particularly in regard to Ukraine – is false. On Wednesday, Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified before the House Intelligence Committee and stated that Trump told him, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

Sondland said:

I finally called the president… I believe I just asked him an open-ended question, Mr. Chairman. What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want? It was a very short abrupt conversation, he was not in a good mood, and he just said, ‘I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,’ something to that effect.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) essentially dismantled the basis for the Democrats’ entire impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, demonstrating that, despite Sondland’s presumptions that a phone call, meeting, and aid were contingent on an announcement of an investigation into the 2016 elections and Burisma, the country received all three without any such pledge.

“I mean, you got all three of them wrong. They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It’s not 2+2. It’s 0-3. I mean I’ve never seen anything like this,” Jordan said.

Buttigieg, who has experienced a significant boost in Iowa in recent weeks, is also soaring in New Hampshire, a poll released Tuesday indicated.

The survey, taken November 13-18, 2019, among 255 likely Democratic primary voters, showed Buttigieg leading the pack with 25 percent support – a full ten points ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom garnered 15 percent support.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in fourth place with nine percent support. Due to the relatively small sampling, the margin of error is +/- 6.1 percent, although Buttigieg’s lead is outside of statistical uncertainty.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) came in behind Sanders with six percent support, followed by billionaire Tom Steyer (D) with five percent support, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who recently closed three offices in New Hampshire, is polling at just one percent in the Granite State:

New Hampshire @SaintAnselmPoll (11/13-18):

Buttigieg 25%

Biden 15%

Warren 15%

Steyer 5%

Gabbard 3%

Booker 3%

Yang 2%

Harris 1% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) November 19, 2019

The poll also showed that over three-fourths of Democrat voters, 77 percent, do not believe former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg should jump into the Democrat primary race.

According to WMUR, “62 percent would discourage former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick from running and 91 percent would discourage 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton from running again.”

The poll comes on the eve of the fifth Democrat primary debate in Atlanta, which will bring the top four contenders – Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg – on the same stage once again."

11:50 PM: Warren just not appealing to people like Peter Gammons…. and David Gergen:

David Gergen on Elizabeth Warren: ""There's a hectoring quality there"" pic.twitter.com/4j1dBUXgvk — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) November 21, 2019

11:39 PM: MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell says Biden’s screw up re: Harris/Moseley Braun was unlike anything he has ever seen in a debate because he forgot that Harris existed. He said Biden had a great debate up until that point and said that gaffe was as bad as it could have gotten for the former vice president.

11:30 PM:

The fifth Democratic debate has wrapped up! Warren spoke the most, followed by Buttigieg. Yang got the least speaking time. https://t.co/hThjmRLpvy pic.twitter.com/fbld4slcjZ — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a “moral moment” right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, “good trouble.” He asks Americans to keep him on the stage.

Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the “criminal in the White House.” He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that “Mr. Trump” is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument.

Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect– “Aloha” values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the “Aloha spirit” when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says “let’s make Dr. King’s dream a reality.”

Yang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for.

He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now.

Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can’t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery.

Harris says we’re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests… she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America’s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices.

Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class.

He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building.

Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history.

Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan.

Biden says he hopes Warren wasn’t talking about the “spotless” Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the “woe is me” attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: “Get up and take it back.”

11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization’s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a “sweeping victory.”

10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg’s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his “inexperience” and cites his recent “careless statement” about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a “murderous dictator like that” (Assad).

Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes.

Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev.

10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over “Washington experience” after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us.

10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a “human right” and an “economic right” when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party.

Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don’t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies.

10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should “codify Roe v. Wade into law.” She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election.

10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if “he was high” when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850.

Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren’t those candidates.

Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. “Everyone gets out, records expunged,” Biden says. Biden says he “comes out of the black community” in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials.

Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: “Nope… The other one’s here.”

Biden misspeaks and says he had support from ""the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate,"" before correcting that he meant ""first."" Harris's reaction:pic.twitter.com/oIL1hcMfWS — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses.

10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an “economic justice” issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will “close the black-white” income gap.

10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country.

10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts.

Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them.

10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says “we have to fundamentally change the culture” re: how women are treated. He talks about the “it’s on us” movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women’s issues by keep “punching at it.”

10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way.

10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we “set the record straight” and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system.

10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks.

10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems.

He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians.

He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but “it is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.” He says America must treat Palestinians with “respect.”

10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah.

Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China.

10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump’s “transactional” foreign policy. He says Trump’s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy.

10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House.

Yang says he will say he is sorry that “I beat your guy.” He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America’s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO.

He says he will propose a new world data organization–like the WTO for data.

Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses.

10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban.

Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the “terrible war in Iraq” while he voted against it.

Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so.

10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years.

Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they “view that as a threat, it’s an easy thing to respond to” by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he’s re: Korea.

10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions.

Harris uses the question to say: “Donald Trump got punked.”

She says Trump “has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego.”

She says Trump is the greatest threat to national security and says she won’t make concessions because there are none to make right now.

10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC’s playbook, says we don’t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says “climate refugees” will cause national security problems all over the world.

He says the fossil fuel industry is “criminally liable” for lying about climate change and “maybe we should prosecute them as well.”

10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won’t say it. Warren won’t say it. He says he will declare a “state of emergency” and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy.

Biden says climate change is “the existential threat to humanity.” He says he doesn’t need a “lecture from my friend” on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than “all of Great Britain produces” while he was passing climate legislation.

Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate.

10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats.

10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump’s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump’s “trade war” that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans.

9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction).

9:53 PM: Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed.

9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight.

Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C’mon.

Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate.

9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like “poker chips” in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible.

Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today.

Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris’s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates.

9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids.

9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say “lock him up” because “it’s about civility” and we need to restore the soul of the country.

Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings.

Biden says Trump has “indicted himself.” Biden says there are two questions–whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general.

9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting “lock him up” at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders’ rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that.

Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted.

9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed.

9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world’s leaders. Sounds very establishment.

9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president.

Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It’s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don’t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with?

9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he “comes from the kind of communities” that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses.

9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: “Thank you, Andrew.”

Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang’s whole campaign theme is that today’s politician don’t understand threat of the future like AI, etc.

9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says

9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network:

Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)? This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip up. Unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/2vJrYx5DKQ — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) November 17, 2019

9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals?

9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the “rot” she she’s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the “foreign policy establishment” in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war.

Harris is asked to respond and she says “it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage” who wants to be the party’s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and “buddying up to Steve Bannon.” Harris is months late on this comeback–and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short.

9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don’t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn’t and then talks about a health care system that is “cruel and dysfunctional.” He says “some of the people up here” think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He’s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn’t mention them by name.

Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch.

9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to “feel it” and “taste it” after the third year, people are going to want it.

Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: “Thank you, I wrote the damn bill.”

9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can “galvanize” and not “polarize.” He pitches his “Medicare for all who want it” plan and says Democrats should not be “commanding” people to get Medicare.

9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her “two cents” wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren’s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth.

Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard.

It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the “moderate” candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage.

Warren says she is “tired of freeloading billionaires” and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish.

9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says “we have a criminal in the White House.” Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail.

9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated.

“Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee,” Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn’t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell’s question. Mitchell doesn’t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity.

9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump’s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a “tender” moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed.

9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a “pathological liar” who is the “most corrupt president” in modern history when asked how central Trump’s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can “walk and chew bubble gum at the same time” by dealing with Trump’s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the “rigged economy.”

9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won’t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery.

9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course.

Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale.

9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including “national security, race, and climate.”

8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an “anti-Trump” party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms.

8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate:

Governor @DevalPatrick was supposed to have an event at Morehouse College tonight. An organizer with the college who planned the event told CNN that Patrick cancelled the event when he arrived and learned that he would not have an audience. (Note, two people came, not pictured) pic.twitter.com/CzNjWYcWKJ — Annie Grayer (@AnnieGrayerCNN) November 21, 2019

8:39 PM: Can Mayor Pete take the heat tonight? Will his poll numbers hold after tonight’s debate?

Nina Turner of the Sander campaign, speaking for herself, ripped Buttigieg last night. And he’s going to face a lot more of that as Iowa gets nearer. Candidates like Harris and Warren who had polling surges going into the debates lost their momentum after the debates.

Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, went off on Pete Buttigieg at a fundraiser in Atlanta last night. “I don’t think you are in any position to be president,” she said, shredding the South Bend mayor’s response to a police shooting of a Black man in his city. pic.twitter.com/pwSSiXRvMl — Hayley Miller (@hayleymiller01) November 20, 2019

A message from Stacey Abrams, who is on stage firing up the crowd before the debate begins. She may fit today’s “woke” Democrats who want to leave no identity group behind as well as Ed Orgeron just fits LSU. She may regret years down the line that she didn’t get into a race that was hers for the taking. Opportunities like this do not present themselves often. Obama seized his chance.

For the first time, President Trump is taking the lead ahead of four top Democrat candidates in potential head to head match-ups, according to a Wednesday poll conducted by Marquette University Law School.

According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed.

“We don’t know how this story is going to end,” said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. “At the moment just over half think there was an ask.”

It was also noted that in October — before the public testimony began — the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed.

When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the margin of error), which turns the tables from August’s survey results that showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent.

As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by 48 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent.

“Call it a small advantage to Trump,” said Franklin.

The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not.

With regards to whether or not the president’s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong.

The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

Elizabeth Warren's introductory ""Medicare for All"" option looks similar to the proposals championed by former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.",2019-11-21,CNN,"Health care: How plans from Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren stack up",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/democrats-health-care-plans-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-bernie-sanders/index.html,"(CNN) At first glance, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's introductory ""Medicare for All"" option looks similar to the proposals championed by former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

All three would offer government-run health insurance options on the Affordable Care Act exchanges that would compete with private insurance plans. All would allow those with employer-sponsored policies to sign up for the public plan. All promise to make the coverage more affordable. And all would automatically enroll low-income Americans in coverage.

But Warren's proposal , and what it would offer Americans, is significantly different from those of her more moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

To start, it would be the first step toward adopting a government-run Medicare for All system in the US, which is Sen. Bernie Sanders' brainchild. Also, her option is far more generous and is aimed at building support for full universal coverage by quickly immersing tens of millions of Americans in Medicare for All.

""It looks like a very substantial down payment on Medicare for All,"" said Chris Jennings, a health policy expert and former official in the Clinton and Obama administrations. ""It may be more than halfway there.""

The risk for Warren is that her new plan is unlikely to blunt attacks from either Biden or Buttigieg , while inviting new skepticism from some on the left, who had previously questioned her commitment to Sanders' Medicare for All bill. Hours after the release of Warren's proposed ""transition"" this month, Sanders announced that, if elected, he would bring up the full legislation during his ""first week in office"" -- striking an indirect but unmistakable contrast with his longtime progressive ally.

Sanders' transition plan, which he first introduced in 2017, would, in its first year, place every American 55 or older, along with people up to age 18, into his version of the Medicare for All program. People would also have the option to buy in immediately. Over the next two years, according to the current bill's language, the Medicare for All enrollment age would drop to 45, then 35. By the fourth year, everyone would be covered.

Buttigieg's emergence as the front-runner in Iowa means his own proposal is about to come under increased scrutiny. Buttigieg's plan, which he describes as ""Medicare for all who want it,"" is a thinner version of what Warren is planning to do off the bat, and neither the South Bend mayor nor Biden has drawn up a clear path to universal coverage -- a priority for almost every Democrat running in the primary.

Here are some notable ways the leading primary contenders' plans differ:

How much people have to pay

Biden and Buttigieg aim to expand coverage in part by enhancing federal premium subsidies -- both for those currently eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those who now earn too much for assistance.

They would provide access to premium subsidies to everyone buying insurance on the exchanges. Under Obamacare, only those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $50,000 for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four, qualify for federal help.

Those subsidies would be used to cap premiums at a maximum of 8.5% of income, rather than roughly 10% under Obamacare. And Biden and Buttigieg would tie the premium subsidies to more generous gold plans -- which have lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs -- rather than silver policies so enrollees would spend less when they visit the doctor or a hospital.

And Buttigieg would allow those with access to employer coverage to buy policies on the Obamacare exchange and receive federal subsidies, while Biden would open up the subsidies to workers who select the public option. Currently, those with affordable policies at their jobs don't qualify for Obamacare subsides.

Also, Biden and Buttigieg would automatically enroll uninsured, low-income Americans either in the public option or in Medicaid, depending on whether their state expanded Medicaid to those making less than 138% of the poverty level, or roughly $17,250 for an individual or $35,550 for a family of four.

Buttigieg also wants to create a fund that would reimburse health care providers for caring for the uninsured. Those lacking coverage would be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Warren's option, which she is proposing to pass in the first 100 days of her administration, would have no monthly premium for children under 18 and people below 200% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $25,000 for an individual and $51,500 for a family of four.

For everyone else, premiums would be capped at 5% of income -- making her option cheaper and, in theory, more attractive as she seeks to build public support for a full transition to Medicare for All.

Plus, deductibles wouldn't exist in Warren's plan. Children and those earning less than twice the poverty level would have no out-of-pocket costs for care. Others would have to pay something, though it would be capped.

Over time, premiums and cost-sharing would gradually decrease to zero.

What benefits enrollees would receive

The public option plans envisioned by Biden and Buttigieg would provide the same broad coverage as the policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges today. Obamacare requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, including mental health, prescription drugs and maternity, at a minimum.

Warren's option would be even more comprehensive, providing the same benefits as the Medicare for All bill introduced by Sanders, who is committed to passing his legislation in one shot. It would cover vision, dental, hearing aids and some long-term care.

How much it will cost

Biden says his plan would cost roughly $750 billion over 10 years, which he would pay for by raising the top marginal tax rate and the rate on capital gains for the wealthy. Buttigieg's proposal would come in at $1.5 trillion over a decade, which he would cover by rolling back President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and through cost savings from allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

Warren hasn't specified the cost of the first step of her plan. However, her campaign said it would be ""significantly higher"" than her rivals' proposals but less than the $11 trillion Americans are expected to shell out for health care over the next decade."

The comments from Obama build on a series of statements the former President has made about the race for his old job, injecting the popular Democrat into a nomination fight that he had largely avoided.

""Everybody needs to chill out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process,"" Obama said after a lengthy answer that defend the arduous primary process that Democrats are currently in.

Obama, until recently, rarely commented on the 2020 field, but at a fundraiser here in Silicon Valley on Thursday the President cheered on the vigorous debate happening inside the party while stressing the need to get elected and warned about some of the obstacles the numerous women candidates and one gay candidate will likely face.

Obama did not mention any of the candidates by name, but it was clear that the former President -- whose legacy continues to loom large over the party -- is watching the debate play out with a close eye on how the candidates are positioning themselves to defeat President Donald Trump.

And the comments come as the field of Democrats vying to take on Trump has fluctuated in recent weeks with former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launching a late-entry presidential campaign last week . Patrick, who is a close friend to Obama, largely jumped into the race of fear over the state of the current crop of Democrats could not beat Trump.

""There will be differences,"" Obama said about the candidates, ""but I want us to make sure that we keep in mind that, relative to the ultimate goal, which is to defeat a president and a party that has ... taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country,"" those differences are ""relatively minor.""

The former President added it was important to draw a line between contentious arguments playing out inside the party and the need to get elected, decrying ""purity tests"" because ""the country's complicated.""

""Those are good arguments to have,"" he said about debates of health care and climate change, ""but you got to win the election.""

He also cautioned Democratic voters from getting too wrapped up in the issues they have with individual candidates, telling the audience in California that people's ""flaws are magnified"" during a primary.

""The field will narrow and there's going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care,"" Obama said bluntly, ""because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.""

The roughly 100-person fundraiser was hosted by Karla Jurvetson, a physician-turned-Democratic megadonor. Jurvetson was previously married to Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who sits on the board of SpaceX and Tesla.

The highest priced tickets to the event went for $355,000, which guests paid to ""chair the event"" and attend a private ""VIP reception"" with the former President. Entry level tickets cost $10,000. Event attendees included Steph Curry, the All-Star guard for the Golden State Warriors, and his wife, actress and author Ayesha Curry.

The event benefits the DNC's Democratic Unity Fund, a cache of money that will is being raised to eventually benefit the party's general election campaign. This is Obama's first event of the cycle for the DNC.

Obama's comments follow similar statements he made earlier this month, where he urged the 2020 candidates to ""pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" warning them about going so far on certain policies that they become out of step with voters.

""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said last week, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

Those statements -- at the time -- were particularly noteworthy for Obama. But the President has now made a series of comments about the field, signaling that he may be interested in having more of a say in the race than previously understood.

One issue Obama spoke at length about on Thursday was income inequality, where he urged Democrats to ""push hard"" on the issue, arguing that this is ""an area where the room to talk about this in bold ways is greater than it was in 2008.""

""I think it is very important for the Democratic Party to be clear and bold about saying ... we are going to initiate structural changes that reduce that inequality,"" Obama said.

A number of Democratic candidates -- including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- have made fighting income inequality central to their campaigns and Obama said he believes it's one area where there is more room now for Democrats to go big.

""It is something we were aware of in 2008 and we wanted to do more about, but the first thing was putting out a big fire to make sure we didn't have a great depression,"" Obama said of the issue.

The former President also specifically related questions about his race in 2008 to headwinds the numerous women running for president and the one gay candidate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, could face in the future.

""We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate and those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination or if they win the general election just like I did,"" Obama said, adding that there were many people in 2008 who said, ""I don't know about Barack Hussein Obama.""

But, Obama said, those candidates can ""overcome that resistance"" if they are able to fame issues and have a message that shows them as ""part of an American tradition of opening up opportunity and making room for people and treating everybody fairly."""

Pete Buttigieg defend his level of experience on Wednesday in contentious exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, using the debate to argue “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.”

The most contentious point of Buttigieg’s defense came when the mayor said, “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country.”

Buttigieg’s experience – he leads a city of just over 100,000 people, has only ever been elected by a few voters thousand and lost his only statewide election – has been a central question about his candidacy. And it was clear on Wednesday that his competitors came into the debate looking to questions his qualifications.

When Buttigieg mentioned voting rights, Klobuchar jumped in and said the issue is a “good example of where (Buttigieg) has said the right words” but not followed it up with action and called the mayor a “local official.”

“I have actually done this work,” Klobuchar said.

Buttigieg fired back.

“Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said, nodding not only his time as mayor, but his experience as a war veteran.

“I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late,” Buttigieg said.

Then Gabbard jumped and said Buttigieg showed a lack of judgment when he suggested using the U.S. military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.

“That is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics, Buttigieg responded. “Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? … I’m talking about building alliances.”

The mayor then hit Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“Let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad,” Buttigieg said.

Gabbard responded by noting how past leaders met with opposing leaders, citing when President John F. Kennedy met with Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev and former President Franklin Roosevelt met with Russian leader Joseph Stalin.

Buttigieg interrupted, “Like Donald Trump who met with Kim,” a nod to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday delivered a speech at Clark Atlanta University, and declared that it is time to adopt Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s (D-TX) legislation on reparations.

Warren delivered a speech at the historically black university Thursday evening and stressed the need to pass Lee’s reparations legislation, which “establishes the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans.”

“Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations,” Warren wrote in a tweet containing a video of her remarks:

Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren pic.twitter.com/Lsl47JezpM — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 22, 2019

“America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people. [It’s] time to adopt H.R. 40, Sheila Jackson Lee’s reparations plan. [It’s] time to do what’s right, so that our nation can begin to heal,” Warren stated.

The commission, according to the summary, would examine slavery and discrimination from 1619 to the modern era and “recommend appropriate remedies.”

While Warren said that would be a “big step,” she suggested that more must be done.

“This is a big step but slavery is not the only history we must confront. Jim Crow was the lived reality in American up through the 1960s,” Warren said.

She continued:

Government redlining meant that too often, toxic waste dumps and polluting factories were located far away from white communities and right next to black communities. The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that locked up millions of black men and women. So don’t talk about race-neutral laws. The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it.

The presidential hopeful argued that each of her plans has an element that will address what she considers racial injustice. For instance, she said her Green New Deal plan would “put racial and environmental justice at the center of our response to climate change.”

“My health care plan will bring down the costs of prescription drugs and tackle the risks of black maternal mortality that is literally killing black women and their babies,” she continued, seemingly ignoring her support for abortion and the impact that has had on the black community.

“My public education plan will put 800 billion new dollars in federal money into our public schools and quadruple the funding or schools that teach low-income children. My student debt cancellation plan will help close the black-white wealth gap in America,” she continued, triumphantly declaring that her plans are “all paid for.”

“One more thing about those plans: They are all paid for, not by raising taxes one penny on working families,” she claimed. “They are all paid for by asking the wealthy and well-connected to just pay a fair share.”

“It’s time for a wealth tax in America. Two cents!” she declared.

This is not the first time Warren has signaled support for having a conversation on issuing reparations. She called for a “national, full-blown” conversation” in March:

Slavery is a stain on America & we need to address it head on. I believe it’s time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what’s right & begin to heal. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 19, 2019

However, when asked about the “direct transfers of money” during a CNN town hall event in March, Warren dodged the question, instead stressing the need for further conversations.

“If I could just follow up on Georgia’s question, you said you’re open to a conversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and Native Americans? Might that include direct payments? Direct transfers of money?” CNN’s Jake Tapper asked.

Warren replied:

There’s a lot of ways to think about the way they should be formed. And I noticed Georgia’s question started with the frame of an apology and national recognition. We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activists that have a whole lot of different approaches to it and I think the best we can do right now

“I love the idea of this congressional commission, let’s bring people together and let’s open that conversation as Americans. Let’s see what ideas people want to put on the table and let’s talk them through,” she continued.

“Because I have to tell you, ignoring the problem is not working,” she added, failing to answer the specific question."

Fifty-three percent of poll respondents said they oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president, while only 40 percent support it. The poll of 801 Wisconsin registered voters was conducted between November 13 and November 17.

The poll of the key battleground state President Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by just 22,000 votes had more good news for the president.

President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

Trump’s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here:

President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Bernie Sanders 45 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.

President Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent

President Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent

Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters.

Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent.

Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent.

Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation.

Only 32 percent of respondents said they “followed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives” very closely.

Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all.

The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president.

Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president’s conduct in office.

Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don’t know.

Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid.

On the bigger question of whether he did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.

While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong, while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so.

The president’s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters.

Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president’s job performance either “strongly” or “somewhat,” while 47 percent approve of his job performance “strongly” or “somewhat.”

The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it.

Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent."

The most significant change is that it will restrict how political ads can be targeted on its platforms.

As the 2020 US presidential election approaches, how online platforms will deal with misinformation and outright false claims by politicians has become a hot-button issue. Google — which has taken in tens of millions of dollars in political advertising in the United States since last year — has been until now notably quiet in the debate surrounding how online platforms handle political ads.

President Donald Trump's reelection campaign ran an ad in October on Google-owned platform YouTube that falsely accused former Vice President Joe Biden of corruption for his role in Ukraine policy during the Obama administration.

A Google spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business on Wednesday that the ad would still be allowed to run on Google's platforms.

This stance comes even as Scott Spencer, a Google vice president, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday, ""It's against our policies for any advertiser to make a false claim — whether it's a claim about the price of a chair or a claim that you can vote by text message, that election day is postponed, or that a candidate has died.""

Booker hit the threshold after seeing a spike in donations after this week's Democratic debate , where he asked for help to qualify for the next event, his campaign said.

As Wednesday's debate came to a close, Booker made a plea to voters.

""I have not yet qualified for the December stage, I need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to CoryBooker.com, please help,"" he said.

The people delivered: Wednesday was the ""best new donor day of the campaign to date,"" and more than 70% of the donors were first-time donors to the campaign, according to Booker spokesperson Sabrina Singh. The campaign raised more than half a million dollars in the nine hours since Booker's closing statement, Singh said.

PBS NewsHour is partnering with Politico to produce the debate on December 19 from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. At least six Democrats have qualified to participate: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Candidates have until December 12 to meet the qualifying criteria established by the Democratic National Committee and its partners to receive an invitation to the debate.

The debate comes during tumultuous times in US history, shaped by ongoing presidential impeachment proceedings in Washington, and a country deeply divided along ideological lines.

The House impeachment proceedings are expected to continue through December, and if the House impeaches President Donald Trump, the Senate will likely take it up in January. Six of the Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination currently serve as US senators and will need to be in Washington if the Senate convenes a trial. This will make the December debate even more critical as it could be the last time these candidates will have a national stage until the next debate in January.

(AP) — Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of his former Vice President Joe Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can defeat President Donald Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

He also noted the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which now includes five women, three black candidates, a Latino man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation’s first black president.

“We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election — just like I did,” Obama told donors. “You can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, ’Look, I’m part of an American tradition … of opening up opportunity.”

In recent weeks Obama has sought to play both referee and uplifting elder statesman. He’s cautioned “woke” activists against embracing “cancel culture” and urged the party to not adopt positions that could cost them in the general election.

“That’s not bringing about change,” he said during a recent Obama Foundation event. “If all you are doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far.”

At the same time, he has offered reassurances that a spirited primary will make the eventual nominee a stronger candidate.

It comes amid a fierce intraparty debate that has divided centrists and an ascendant progressive wing, which has advocated for policies like free college tuition and “Medicare for All” that would dramatically reshape the role of government in peoples’ lives.

Elections are ultimately won by offering a message that appeals to voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama said.

“We should not be somehow thinking either we’re going for our base voter of young hipsters and African Americans and single women versus Joe lunch-pail, hard-hat guy,” he said. “Because you know what? … I’ve had conversations with all those groups, and they share common dreams and common hopes and a vision for what a fair, just America would look like.”

The fundraiser Thursday was held at the home of Karla Jurvetson, a prominent Democratic donor and Silicon Valley philanthropist. The event raised more than $3 million for the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior party official."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday released an ad slamming politicians for rewarding big donors with ambassadorships, despite the fact that she supported the big donors former President Obama nominated, many of whom had no experience.

Warren answered a question about the ongoing partisan impeachment hearing during Wednesday evening’s Democrat debate and mentioned Ambassador Gordon Sondland – a key witness of the Democrats who testified that Trump told him, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo” – and contended he landed his position due to his status as a big donor.

She said:

But I want to add one more part based on today’s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they’re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I’ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador, because I’m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who’s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.

She also released an ad, reiterating the point she made during the debate. Warren states in the ad:

At the center of Donald Trump’s crimes and chaos is the millionaire donor he made an ambassador Republicans and Democrats have been rewarding big donors with cushy ambassadorships like this for years. It’s Washington corruption at its worst. When I’m president, that stops. I’m the only candidate running who’s made this promise. I’ll never give ambassadorships to unqualified donors just because they wrote me fat checks.

However, Warren did not seem to take issue with the concept during Obama’s tenure, confirming his nominees who held no diplomatic experience. One of those nominees included Hollywood producer Colleen Bell, whose experience amounted to raising $2 million for Obama’s campaigns. Despite that, he nominated her to be the ambassador to Hungary.

“During her confirmation hearing, Bell failed to name a single strategic interest the United States has in Hungary,” as the Washington Free Beacon reported. Nevertheless, Warren confirmed her.

Warren, while still a top tier candidate, fell to third place in the latest Emerson poll, which was taken November 17-20, 2019, among 1,029 registered voters. Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid.

The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters.

Per Emerson:

Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. … Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%.

No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:

“Biden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months – yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,” Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said.

The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren’s 18.5 percent.

Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening’s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) claimed during the fifth Democrat presidential primary debate that illegal immigration at the United States-Mexico border is a “man-made crisis” that President Trump “created.”

“The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border,” Warren said. “Trump is the one who has created this crisis. … When I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border.”

“There’s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys,” Warren said. “A great nation does not separate children from their families.”

As Breitbart News has chronicled, migrants are more often than not brutalized while making their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. In a recent case, a federal immigration official said a pregnant migrant — saved by Border Patrol agents — was beaten by cartel smugglers because she did not pay her debt.

After Border Patrol agents took her to a nearby hospital, the woman was treated for her injuries, while her child died as a result of the beating.

Mexican drug cartels have profited billions from America’s open border through the drug trade and human trafficking, increasing their power in Mexico.

Since 2009, there have been more than 250,000 homicides in Mexico and at least 30,000 disappearances. In 2017, there were 26,573 murders, 1,275 kidnappings, and 5,357 extortion cases in Mexico, marking the bloodiest year in the country in 20 years, despite these figures not capturing the scope of the cartel violence occurring in Mexico.

For Americans, the illegal immigration crisis is very real. In the last year alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested more than 6,600 convicted murderers and convicted sex offenders who were in the United States illegally. Of that total, 4,975 of the illegal aliens arrested were convicted sex offenders. The other 1,641 illegal aliens had been convicted of homicide.

Another 1,913 illegal aliens that were arrested by ICE had pending sex offense charges against them, while 387 illegal aliens had pending murder charges against them. For each one of these crimes, there are at least one or more American and legal immigrant victims.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday evening said she will try to persuade Republicans in the Senate to convict President Trump if the impeachment inquiry moves to a trial in the Senate.

Warren falsely claimed the president broke the law “again and again and again,” citing the Mueller report that found no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, a moderator of Wednesday’s Democrat debate, kicked off the evening by asking Warren if she will attempt to convince her Republican colleagues in the Senate to convict Trump.

“Of course I will,” Warren stated. “The obvious answer is to say first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it. That shows you how the president tried to obstruct justice,” she said, contending that Trump felt free to break the law “again and again and again, and that’s what’s happened with Ukraine.”

“We have to have to establish the principle no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it,” she said.

However, Warren’s claim that the Mueller report showed clear obstruction of justice is false, as former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not make a determination. Attorney General William Barr ultimately concluded that “the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”

Mueller told lawmakers over the summer:

I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. [Ted Lieu (D-CA] — who said, and I quote, ‘You didn’t charge the president because of the [Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)] opinion.’ That is not the correct way to say it.

“As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,” he added.

Additionally, Warren’s claim that the president broke the law “again and again and again” – particularly in regard to Ukraine – is false. On Wednesday, Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified before the House Intelligence Committee and stated that Trump told him, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

Sondland said:

I finally called the president… I believe I just asked him an open-ended question, Mr. Chairman. What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want? It was a very short abrupt conversation, he was not in a good mood, and he just said, ‘I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,’ something to that effect.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) essentially dismantled the basis for the Democrats’ entire impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, demonstrating that, despite Sondland’s presumptions that a phone call, meeting, and aid were contingent on an announcement of an investigation into the 2016 elections and Burisma, the country received all three without any such pledge.

“I mean, you got all three of them wrong. They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It’s not 2+2. It’s 0-3. I mean I’ve never seen anything like this,” Jordan said.

“And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact. He didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite,” he added."

11:39 PM: MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell says Biden’s screw up re: Harris/Moseley Braun was unlike anything he has ever seen in a debate because he forgot that Harris existed. He said Biden had a great debate up until that point and said that gaffe was as bad as it could have gotten for the former vice president.

The fifth Democratic debate has wrapped up! Warren spoke the most, followed by Buttigieg. Yang got the least speaking time. https://t.co/hThjmRLpvy pic.twitter.com/fbld4slcjZ — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a “moral moment” right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, “good trouble.” He asks Americans to keep him on the stage.

Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the “criminal in the White House.” He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that “Mr. Trump” is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument.

Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect– “Aloha” values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the “Aloha spirit” when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says “let’s make Dr. King’s dream a reality.”

Yang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for.

He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now.

Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can’t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery.

Harris says we’re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests… she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America’s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices.

Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class.

He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building.

Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history.

Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan.

Biden says he hopes Warren wasn’t talking about the “spotless” Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the “woe is me” attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: “Get up and take it back.”

11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization’s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a “sweeping victory.”

10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg’s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his “inexperience” and cites his recent “careless statement” about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a “murderous dictator like that” (Assad).

Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes.

Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev.

10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over “Washington experience” after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us.

10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a “human right” and an “economic right” when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party.

Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don’t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies.

10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should “codify Roe v. Wade into law.” She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election.

10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if “he was high” when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850.

Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren’t those candidates.

Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. “Everyone gets out, records expunged,” Biden says. Biden says he “comes out of the black community” in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials.

Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: “Nope… The other one’s here.”

Biden misspeaks and says he had support from ""the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate,"" before correcting that he meant ""first."" Harris's reaction:pic.twitter.com/oIL1hcMfWS — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses.

10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an “economic justice” issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will “close the black-white” income gap.

10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country.

10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts.

Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them.

10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says “we have to fundamentally change the culture” re: how women are treated. He talks about the “it’s on us” movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women’s issues by keep “punching at it.”

10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way.

10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we “set the record straight” and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system.

10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks.

10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems.

He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians.

He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but “it is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.” He says America must treat Palestinians with “respect.”

10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah.

Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China.

10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump’s “transactional” foreign policy. He says Trump’s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy.

10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House.

Yang says he will say he is sorry that “I beat your guy.” He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America’s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO.

He says he will propose a new world data organization–like the WTO for data.

Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses.

10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban.

Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the “terrible war in Iraq” while he voted against it.

Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so.

10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years.

Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they “view that as a threat, it’s an easy thing to respond to” by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he’s re: Korea.

10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions.

Harris uses the question to say: “Donald Trump got punked.”

She says Trump “has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego.”

She says Trump is the greatest threat to national security and says she won’t make concessions because there are none to make right now.

10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC’s playbook, says we don’t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says “climate refugees” will cause national security problems all over the world.

He says the fossil fuel industry is “criminally liable” for lying about climate change and “maybe we should prosecute them as well.”

10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won’t say it. Warren won’t say it. He says he will declare a “state of emergency” and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy.

Biden says climate change is “the existential threat to humanity.” He says he doesn’t need a “lecture from my friend” on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than “all of Great Britain produces” while he was passing climate legislation.

Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate.

10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats.

10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump’s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump’s “trade war” that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans.

9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction).

9:53 PM: Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed.

9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight.

Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C’mon.

Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate.

9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like “poker chips” in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible.

Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today.

Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris’s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates.

9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids.

9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say “lock him up” because “it’s about civility” and we need to restore the soul of the country.

Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings.

Biden says Trump has “indicted himself.” Biden says there are two questions–whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general.

9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting “lock him up” at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders’ rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that.

Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted.

9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed.

9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world’s leaders. Sounds very establishment.

9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president.

Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It’s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don’t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with?

9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he “comes from the kind of communities” that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses.

9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: “Thank you, Andrew.”

Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang’s whole campaign theme is that today’s politician don’t understand threat of the future like AI, etc.

9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says

9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network:

Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)? This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip up. Unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/2vJrYx5DKQ — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) November 17, 2019

9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals?

9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the “rot” she she’s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the “foreign policy establishment” in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war.

Harris is asked to respond and she says “it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage” who wants to be the party’s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and “buddying up to Steve Bannon.” Harris is months late on this comeback–and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short.

9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don’t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn’t and then talks about a health care system that is “cruel and dysfunctional.” He says “some of the people up here” think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He’s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn’t mention them by name.

Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch.

9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to “feel it” and “taste it” after the third year, people are going to want it.

Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: “Thank you, I wrote the damn bill.”

9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can “galvanize” and not “polarize.” He pitches his “Medicare for all who want it” plan and says Democrats should not be “commanding” people to get Medicare.

9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her “two cents” wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren’s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth.

Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard.

It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the “moderate” candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage.

Warren says she is “tired of freeloading billionaires” and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish.

9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says “we have a criminal in the White House.” Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail.

9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated.

“Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee,” Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn’t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell’s question. Mitchell doesn’t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity.

9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump’s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a “tender” moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed.

9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a “pathological liar” who is the “most corrupt president” in modern history when asked how central Trump’s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can “walk and chew bubble gum at the same time” by dealing with Trump’s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the “rigged economy.”

9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won’t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery.

9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course.

Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale.

9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including “national security, race, and climate.”

8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an “anti-Trump” party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms.

8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate:

An organizer with the college who planned the event told CNN that Patrick cancelled the event when he arrived and learned that he would not have an audience.

8:39 PM: Can Mayor Pete take the heat tonight? Will his poll numbers hold after tonight’s debate?

Nina Turner of the Sander campaign, speaking for herself, ripped Buttigieg last night. And he’s going to face a lot more of that as Iowa gets nearer. Candidates like Harris and Warren who had polling surges going into the debates lost their momentum after the debates.

Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, went off on Pete Buttigieg at a fundraiser in Atlanta last night. “I don’t think you are in any position to be president,” she said, shredding the South Bend mayor’s response to a police shooting of a Black man in his city. pic.twitter.com/pwSSiXRvMl — Hayley Miller (@hayleymiller01) November 20, 2019

A message from Stacey Abrams, who is on stage firing up the crowd before the debate begins. She may fit today’s “woke” Democrats who want to leave no identity group behind as well as Ed Orgeron just fits LSU. She may regret years down the line that she didn’t get into a race that was hers for the taking. Opportunities like this do not present themselves often. Obama seized his chance.

The comments from Obama build on a series of statements the former President has made about the race for his old job, injecting the popular Democrat into a nomination fight that he had largely avoided.

""Everybody needs to chill out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process,"" Obama said after a lengthy answer that defend the arduous primary process that Democrats are currently in.

Obama, until recently, rarely commented on the 2020 field, but at a fundraiser here in Silicon Valley on Thursday the President cheered on the vigorous debate happening inside the party while stressing the need to get elected and warned about some of the obstacles the numerous women candidates and one gay candidate will likely face.

Obama did not mention any of the candidates by name, but it was clear that the former President -- whose legacy continues to loom large over the party -- is watching the debate play out with a close eye on how the candidates are positioning themselves to defeat President Donald Trump.

And the comments come as the field of Democrats vying to take on Trump has fluctuated in recent weeks with former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launching a late-entry presidential campaign last week . Patrick, who is a close friend to Obama, largely jumped into the race of fear over the state of the current crop of Democrats could not beat Trump.

""There will be differences,"" Obama said about the candidates, ""but I want us to make sure that we keep in mind that, relative to the ultimate goal, which is to defeat a president and a party that has ... taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country,"" those differences are ""relatively minor.""

The former President added it was important to draw a line between contentious arguments playing out inside the party and the need to get elected, decrying ""purity tests"" because ""the country's complicated.""

""Those are good arguments to have,"" he said about debates of health care and climate change, ""but you got to win the election.""

He also cautioned Democratic voters from getting too wrapped up in the issues they have with individual candidates, telling the audience in California that people's ""flaws are magnified"" during a primary.

""The field will narrow and there's going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care,"" Obama said bluntly, ""because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.""

The roughly 100-person fundraiser was hosted by Karla Jurvetson, a physician-turned-Democratic megadonor. Jurvetson was previously married to Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who sits on the board of SpaceX and Tesla.

The highest priced tickets to the event went for $355,000, which guests paid to ""chair the event"" and attend a private ""VIP reception"" with the former President. Entry level tickets cost $10,000. Event attendees included Steph Curry, the All-Star guard for the Golden State Warriors, and his wife, actress and author Ayesha Curry.

The event benefits the DNC's Democratic Unity Fund, a cache of money that will is being raised to eventually benefit the party's general election campaign. This is Obama's first event of the cycle for the DNC.

Obama's comments follow similar statements he made earlier this month, where he urged the 2020 candidates to ""pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" warning them about going so far on certain policies that they become out of step with voters.

""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said last week, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

Those statements -- at the time -- were particularly noteworthy for Obama. But the President has now made a series of comments about the field, signaling that he may be interested in having more of a say in the race than previously understood.

One issue Obama spoke at length about on Thursday was income inequality, where he urged Democrats to ""push hard"" on the issue, arguing that this is ""an area where the room to talk about this in bold ways is greater than it was in 2008.""

""I think it is very important for the Democratic Party to be clear and bold about saying ... we are going to initiate structural changes that reduce that inequality,"" Obama said.

A number of Democratic candidates -- including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- have made fighting income inequality central to their campaigns and Obama said he believes it's one area where there is more room now for Democrats to go big.

""It is something we were aware of in 2008 and we wanted to do more about, but the first thing was putting out a big fire to make sure we didn't have a great depression,"" Obama said of the issue.

The former President also specifically related questions about his race in 2008 to headwinds the numerous women running for president and the one gay candidate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, could face in the future.

""We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate and those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination or if they win the general election just like I did,"" Obama said, adding that there were many people in 2008 who said, ""I don't know about Barack Hussein Obama.""

But, Obama said, those candidates can ""overcome that resistance"" if they are able to fame issues and have a message that shows them as ""part of an American tradition of opening up opportunity and making room for people and treating everybody fairly."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday delivered a speech at Clark Atlanta University, and declared that it is time to adopt Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s (D-TX) legislation on reparations.

Warren delivered a speech at the historically black university Thursday evening and stressed the need to pass Lee’s reparations legislation, which “establishes the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans.”

“Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations,” Warren wrote in a tweet containing a video of her remarks:

Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren pic.twitter.com/Lsl47JezpM — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 22, 2019

“America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people. [It’s] time to adopt H.R. 40, Sheila Jackson Lee’s reparations plan. [It’s] time to do what’s right, so that our nation can begin to heal,” Warren stated.

The commission, according to the summary, would examine slavery and discrimination from 1619 to the modern era and “recommend appropriate remedies.”

While Warren said that would be a “big step,” she suggested that more must be done.

“This is a big step but slavery is not the only history we must confront. Jim Crow was the lived reality in American up through the 1960s,” Warren said.

She continued:

Government redlining meant that too often, toxic waste dumps and polluting factories were located far away from white communities and right next to black communities. The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that locked up millions of black men and women. So don’t talk about race-neutral laws. The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it.

The presidential hopeful argued that each of her plans has an element that will address what she considers racial injustice. For instance, she said her Green New Deal plan would “put racial and environmental justice at the center of our response to climate change.”

“My health care plan will bring down the costs of prescription drugs and tackle the risks of black maternal mortality that is literally killing black women and their babies,” she continued, seemingly ignoring her support for abortion and the impact that has had on the black community.

“My public education plan will put 800 billion new dollars in federal money into our public schools and quadruple the funding or schools that teach low-income children. My student debt cancellation plan will help close the black-white wealth gap in America,” she continued, triumphantly declaring that her plans are “all paid for.”

“One more thing about those plans: They are all paid for, not by raising taxes one penny on working families,” she claimed. “They are all paid for by asking the wealthy and well-connected to just pay a fair share.”

“It’s time for a wealth tax in America. Two cents!” she declared.

This is not the first time Warren has signaled support for having a conversation on issuing reparations. She called for a “national, full-blown” conversation” in March:

Slavery is a stain on America & we need to address it head on. I believe it’s time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what’s right & begin to heal. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 19, 2019

However, when asked about the “direct transfers of money” during a CNN town hall event in March, Warren dodged the question, instead stressing the need for further conversations.

“If I could just follow up on Georgia’s question, you said you’re open to a conversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and Native Americans? Might that include direct payments? Direct transfers of money?” CNN’s Jake Tapper asked.

Warren replied:

There’s a lot of ways to think about the way they should be formed. And I noticed Georgia’s question started with the frame of an apology and national recognition. We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activists that have a whole lot of different approaches to it and I think the best we can do right now

“I love the idea of this congressional commission, let’s bring people together and let’s open that conversation as Americans. Let’s see what ideas people want to put on the table and let’s talk them through,” she continued.

“Because I have to tell you, ignoring the problem is not working,” she added, failing to answer the specific question."

President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

Trump’s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here:

President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Bernie Sanders 45 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.

President Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent

President Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent

Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters.

Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent.

Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent.

Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation.

Only 32 percent of respondents said they “followed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives” very closely.

Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all.

The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president.

Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president’s conduct in office.

Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don’t know.

Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid.

On the bigger question of whether he did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.

While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong, while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so.

The president’s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters.

Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president’s job performance either “strongly” or “somewhat,” while 47 percent approve of his job performance “strongly” or “somewhat.”

The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it.

Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent."

(AP) — Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of his former Vice President Joe Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can defeat President Donald Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

He also noted the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which now includes five women, three black candidates, a Latino man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation’s first black president.

“We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election — just like I did,” Obama told donors. “You can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, ’Look, I’m part of an American tradition … of opening up opportunity.”

In recent weeks Obama has sought to play both referee and uplifting elder statesman. He’s cautioned “woke” activists against embracing “cancel culture” and urged the party to not adopt positions that could cost them in the general election.

“That’s not bringing about change,” he said during a recent Obama Foundation event. “If all you are doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far.”

At the same time, he has offered reassurances that a spirited primary will make the eventual nominee a stronger candidate.

It comes amid a fierce intraparty debate that has divided centrists and an ascendant progressive wing, which has advocated for policies like free college tuition and “Medicare for All” that would dramatically reshape the role of government in peoples’ lives.

Elections are ultimately won by offering a message that appeals to voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama said.

“We should not be somehow thinking either we’re going for our base voter of young hipsters and African Americans and single women versus Joe lunch-pail, hard-hat guy,” he said. “Because you know what? … I’ve had conversations with all those groups, and they share common dreams and common hopes and a vision for what a fair, just America would look like.”

The fundraiser Thursday was held at the home of Karla Jurvetson, a prominent Democratic donor and Silicon Valley philanthropist. The event raised more than $3 million for the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior party official."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday released an ad slamming politicians for rewarding big donors with ambassadorships, despite the fact that she supported the big donors former President Obama nominated, many of whom had no experience.

Warren answered a question about the ongoing partisan impeachment hearing during Wednesday evening’s Democrat debate and mentioned Ambassador Gordon Sondland – a key witness of the Democrats who testified that Trump told him, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo” – and contended he landed his position due to his status as a big donor.

She said:

But I want to add one more part based on today’s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they’re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I’ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador, because I’m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who’s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.

She also released an ad, reiterating the point she made during the debate. Warren states in the ad:

At the center of Donald Trump’s crimes and chaos is the millionaire donor he made an ambassador Republicans and Democrats have been rewarding big donors with cushy ambassadorships like this for years. It’s Washington corruption at its worst. When I’m president, that stops. I’m the only candidate running who’s made this promise. I’ll never give ambassadorships to unqualified donors just because they wrote me fat checks.

However, Warren did not seem to take issue with the concept during Obama’s tenure, confirming his nominees who held no diplomatic experience. One of those nominees included Hollywood producer Colleen Bell, whose experience amounted to raising $2 million for Obama’s campaigns. Despite that, he nominated her to be the ambassador to Hungary.

“During her confirmation hearing, Bell failed to name a single strategic interest the United States has in Hungary,” as the Washington Free Beacon reported. Nevertheless, Warren confirmed her.

Warren, while still a top tier candidate, fell to third place in the latest Emerson poll, which was taken November 17-20, 2019, among 1,029 registered voters. Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid.

The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters.

Per Emerson:

Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. … Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%.

No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:

“Biden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months – yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,” Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said.

The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren’s 18.5 percent.

Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening’s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in."

“We should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools,” she continued.

A school choice activist confronted Warren at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday, the same activist who reportedly led the protest against the presidential candidate during her speech at Clark-Atlanta University the same day.

“We are going to have the same choice that you had for your kids because I read that your children went to private schools,” the activist, Sarah Carpenter told Warren.

“My children went to public schools,” Warren told her:

However, according to the Free Beacon, Warren sent her son Alex to a private school:

A school yearbook obtained by the Washington Free Beacon indicates, however, that Warren’s son, Alex Warren, attended the Kirby Hall School for at least the 1986-1987 school year, Warren’s final year as a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The college preparatory school is known for its “academically advanced curriculum” and offers small class sizes for students in grades K-12. The yearbook indicates that Alex Warren attended as a fifth grader.

Warren’s campaign confirmed that her son went to private school – a private school that currently costs roughly $15,000 per year. “According to the Austin American-Statesman, Kirby Hall’s tuition was $4,700 a year in 1995, the earliest record of the school’s tuition costs reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon,” the outlet reported.

“Elizabeth’s daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade,” Warren communications director Kristen Orthman said in a statement to both Free Beacon and Fox News.

She added:

Elizabeth wants every kid to get a great education regardless of where they live, which is why her plan makes a historic investment in our public schools. Every public school should be a great school. Her plan does not affect funding for existing non-profit charter schools, but she believes we should not put public dollars behind a further expansion of charters until they are subject to the same accountability requirements as public schools.

Warren’s current stance stands in stark contrast to the position she held during her 2012 senatorial campaign. At the time, she emphatically supported charter schools and school vouchers.

During an interview with Fox Business in May 2011, she said:

The point is, we have a private school system now, only the way it’s doled out is instead of paying tuition, you buy a house in a certain zip code and pay taxes and keep everyone locked out who’s not in that zip code. We call those public schools. But look at the financing for them. If every child in the state of Massachusetts — every child in this country — got a ticket, and the ticket was funded by taxpayers, because I believe in public education, but it could be used at any school regardless of what kind of house parents can afford to buy, it would first take the pressure off parents in terms of having to buy those houses, and second would mean that those schools now compete with each other for offering the kind of education that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.

Warren’s current education plan also includes a proposition for “free” universal pre-k, the cancellation of student lunch debt, and enhanced protections for illegal immigrant students."

(CNN) The decision by Sen. Elizabeth Warren to unveil her Medicare for All plan left little doubt that health care will likely be the single most important policy issue facing Americans in 2020. And while much of the political narrative will focus on how the election represents a referendum on President Donald Trump, Sen. Warren decided to listen to polls and make health care reform a central theme of her campaign.

It's a bold decision. And a risky one. To announce an eye-watering $20 trillion government-run health care program as a central pillar of one's platform would have, a decade ago, earned any politician derision and mockery while sinking his/her chances for ever running for president.

That it is now a serious part of a leading contender's platform is a testament to how quickly the political landscape has changed.

The courage that is needed to publicly disclose a fully-costed Medicare plan cannot be understated. It also demonstrates that Sen. Warren wants to have a real debate about policy, which should be commended given how elusive nuanced discussion has become in the hyperpolarized political climate.

The evidence about the importance of universal health coverage to the well-being of society is strong: Various studies show such coverage reduces disease mortality rates, poverty and inequality and prolongs life. It should, therefore, not come as a surprise that there is a growing momentum to recognize health care as a basic human right

Each of us are personally touched by a health care issue at some point in our lives -- and most reasonable people believe that one should not endure financial hardship because he or she became sick.

The more difficult question is whether a Medicare for All plan is the best way to achieve universal health coverage. Most of the discussion has centered on how much it would cost to implement Medicare for All and not enough on how this would impact patients directly.

As a Canadian physician, and one who works in a single-payer model, I believe it is imperative to present to patients the many benefits of a transition to a Canadian-style model, such as cheaper prices for drugs such as insulin, along with the potential pitfalls of such a system, so that voters are better able to make an informed decision at the ballot box.

The non-partisan Commonwealth Fund has ranked a number of health care systems with single-payer models -- including that of Canada -- as consistently among the worst of 11 OECD nations on patient outcomes, access and equity. Interestingly, even those who study health care systems have been reluctant to endorse a single-payer model.

Part of this stems from the fact that close to 5 million Canadians, roughly 13% of the population, currently don't have a family doctor. Compounding this problem are the soaring specialist wait times that are unfortunately becoming a hallmark of our health care system. Sadly, the shuttering of clinics and rationing of care is happening at alarming rates in Canada.

The reason for this is a combination of factors that includes the unique situation of physicians being treated as independent private contractors. This means doctors bill the government for their services rendered to patients, but in many circumstances are responsible for setting up their own clinics, having to pay the cost of rent, utilities, medical supplies and other human resources overhead.

In this paradigm , the government sets a ceiling for physician billings. With increased costs, many physicians have decided to reduce their hours, work part-time, cease practicing and retire.

Moreover, it is also not uncommon for my patients to wait over a year from the moment I refer them to an orthopedic surgeon to the time they receive the appropriate workup, imaging and are ultimately operated upon.

This is happening amid a doctor shortage in Canada where, paradoxically, newly qualified primary and specialist physicians -- many of whom I know personally and trained alongside -- are having trouble finding work. It is increasingly challenging for new graduates to find jobs in specialty care centers, which often have restrictions on the number of full-time hires that can be employed.

All of this helps explain why nearly 200,000 Canadians travel abroad annually for health care services.

Nevertheless, there is a valid argument to be made in the United States about reducing per capita spending on health care to align with rates in other nations . Administrative costs in Canada are much lower than in the United States , and physicians don't have to navigate labyrinthine payment structures with multiple insurance companies.

Most importantly, patients are also not being bankrupted for merely needing health care services.

However, Sen. Warren's plan to put pressure on the supply side of the health care industry may serve to alienate providers who will make decisions based on economic considerations. In other words, by squeezing providers and hospitals, a government-administered system will reduce incentives to see patients and exacerbate the epidemic of burnout within health care communities.

There is no perfect health care system. In the same way that many would describe the American system as too beholden to greedy insurance companies, one might argue that an unyielding adherence to a single-payer philosophy has also prevented desperately needed reform in Canada.

The best answer probably lies somewhere in between, and the Goldilocks approach is something to which Americans should give serious consideration. Blended health care models -- that is, mixtures of public and private payer options -- have a track record of success around the world, which is why strengthening of Obamacare and a fill-in-the-gaps plan is likely to be the most realistic, methodical and cost-effective way of improving upon a system in dire need of reform."

It's the closest Bloomberg has come to directly saying that the candidates in the current Democratic field are unable to defeat Trump. But the subtext was obvious on Monday.

""I think that there is a greater risk of having Donald Trump reelected than there was before,"" Bloomberg said, reflecting on his decision to mount a late entry bid to the presidency. ""And, in the end, I looked in the mirror and said, 'You just cannot let this happen.'""

Bloomberg officially announced his Democratic presidential bid on Sunday, unveiling a campaign that he said will be squarely aimed at defeating Trump and casting himself as a ""a doer and a problem solver -- not a talker.""

Bloomberg's brief visit to Norfolk was an odd opening salvo to a presidential campaign, but illustrated the candidate's approach to focusing on Trump. Norfolk is home to a naval base, and Bloomberg sought to draw attention to the departure of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, who in a letter announcing his resignation suggested Trump was undermining the ""key principle of good order and discipline"" of the US military.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) kicked off her campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, on Monday by blasting Michael Bloomberg and his “version of democracy,” arguing that he is not relying on people but “bags and bags of money” to “buy the nomination.”

Warren, a fierce critic of Bloomberg, kicked off a town hall meeting in Ankeny, Iowa, by addressing the billionaire’s entry into the race.

“So I am here during day two of Michael Bloomberg’s 37 million dollar ad buy,” Warren said. “Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about Democracy in 2020. He doesn’t need people. He only needs bags and bags of money.”

She added that it is precisely how he “plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party:”

His view is that he doesn’t need people who knock on doors. He doesn’t need to get out and campaign with people. He doesn’t need volunteers. And if you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he’ll just spend another $37 million to flood the airwaves.

“I think this is fundamentally wrong,” Warren said, warning that if Bloomberg’s “version of democracy wins,” it will fundamentally change democracy as we know it.

“It’s going to be about which billionaire can you stomach going forward. Because believe me, there are plenty of billionaires who think they should be president, or the minimum, should be picking the president,” she said:

Many Warren allies view Bloomberg’s late entry into the race as a positive for the Massachusetts senator, noting that he encapsulates precisely what Warren claims she is campaigning against.

“This may be one of the most important things that happened to her campaign,” Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green said, according to the Daily Beast.

“Bloomberg’s entrance centers the conversation to the core themes that have been instrumental to Elizabeth Warren’s rise,” he continued, noting “the systemic corruption of our democracy by billionaires,” specifically.

Bloomberg, thus far, has spent more time focusing on President Trump as opposed to his immediate Democrat competitors.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” he states on his campaign website.

“We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he continues, calling Trump an “existential threat to our country and our values.”

“If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage,” he warns. “The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America.”

Bloomberg is expected to virtually ignore the first four states in the Democrat Primary – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – and focus on Super Tuesday instead."

(CNN) Last-minute presidential candidates such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , a managing director at Bain Capital, have entered the race in an effort to promote moderation and defeat progressive Democratic candidates who Wall Street fears.

But the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt is actually poised to return to its roots in the real center of mainstream public opinion, in which people believe in an active role for government to improve their lives. In this presidential election season, the party could reclaim the mantle of protecting working people, the middle class and the poor at a time of gaping wealth inequality, when popular opinion increasingly believes billionaires have too much, corporations pay too little in taxes and ordinary people are suffering.

This is why, contrary to the concerns of some political leaders and pundits, most prominently former President Barack Obama, the Democratic Party does not risk veering too far to the left.

At a recent event with wealthy donors, Obama claimed the ""average American"" does not want to ""completely tear down the system and remake it,"" and America ""is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.""

Despite running for president and energizing the nation just a decade ago as a center-left candidate with a message of hope and change, Obama seems to think America does not need systemic change, and Democrats should not rock the boat or make any sudden moves.

Democrats on Twitter who reject Obama's warning not to move too far left responded to the former president's comments with the hashtag #TooFarLeft, which at the time became the top trending tag in the US and the third globally, according to Democratic strategist Peter Daou

Daou, who started the hashtag, wanted to eviscerate the mainstream talking point that social, economic, racial and environmental justice is somehow a radical position.

Indeed, considering the state of the country, its festering political, economic and social problems and the seeming inability of government to address them, Daou and others who have embraced the hashtag make a good point. America is not well, and ignoring the symptoms of what ails the nation -- not pushing too far for change -- is what gave us Donald Trump.

Consider the status quo with rising inequality, low taxation on the wealthy and corporations, and the dimming life prospects of millennials.

Earning less money and saddled with more debt than their parents, young people in America, one study finds , cannot afford their health-care needs and are on a trajectory for a shorter life span than generations before them. According to the study, millennials are facing more chronic health issues, depression and suicide than Gen Xers due to the economic crisis, student debt, the opioid crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other issues. The impending health crisis is eroding the earning potential of this younger generation.

Wall Street is frightened at the prospect of a progressive in the mold of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, and some billionaires are having a temper tantrum because they refuse to pay their fair share of taxes.

A number of big money Democratic donors have vowed to sit out or support Trump if Warren receives the nomination. Bill Gates seemingly has not ruled out voting for Trump if he would otherwise be forced to pay Warren's wealth tax.

Establishment and Wall Street Dems are misreading the winds of public sentiment if they believe moderation is a winning political strategy for 2020. There is no constituency for a presidential candidate who prescribes half-measures to put out a fire.

And polling indicates that.

For example, a 2019 Quinnipiac poll found that 60% of registered voters support a 2% wealth tax on people who own assets over $50 million. The wealth tax concept enjoys support across political parties and all demographic groups.

Further, according to a KFF Health Tracking Poll, health care is the leading issue that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the presidential candidates to discuss. Further, according to a poll earlier this year from Politico and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Republicans believe it is ""extremely important"" for Congress to tackle student debt.

Even while acknowledging the historic diversity in the Democratic field, Obama urges that candidates rein in their messaging.

""We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election -- just like I did,"" Obama said at another event . ""You can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, 'Look, I'm part of an American tradition ... of opening up opportunity.'""

The former president is mistaken if he believes that in appealing to the electorate, Democrats must tamp down their message and advocate for tweaks in the system rather than systemic reform. This, in a country that touts itself as the ""land of opportunity,"" yet has one of the lowest rates of socioeconomic mobility

The party of FDR could very well inspire and energize Americans looking for change with policy prescriptions such as Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and free college."

(CNN) The decision by Sen. Elizabeth Warren to unveil her Medicare for All plan left little doubt that health care will likely be the single most important policy issue facing Americans in 2020. And while much of the political narrative will focus on how the election represents a referendum on President Donald Trump, Sen. Warren decided to listen to polls and make health care reform a central theme of her campaign.

It's a bold decision. And a risky one. To announce an eye-watering $20 trillion government-run health care program as a central pillar of one's platform would have, a decade ago, earned any politician derision and mockery while sinking his/her chances for ever running for president.

That it is now a serious part of a leading contender's platform is a testament to how quickly the political landscape has changed.

The courage that is needed to publicly disclose a fully-costed Medicare plan cannot be understated. It also demonstrates that Sen. Warren wants to have a real debate about policy, which should be commended given how elusive nuanced discussion has become in the hyperpolarized political climate.

The evidence about the importance of universal health coverage to the well-being of society is strong: Various studies show such coverage reduces disease mortality rates, poverty and inequality and prolongs life. It should, therefore, not come as a surprise that there is a growing momentum to recognize health care as a basic human right

Each of us are personally touched by a health care issue at some point in our lives -- and most reasonable people believe that one should not endure financial hardship because he or she became sick.

The more difficult question is whether a Medicare for All plan is the best way to achieve universal health coverage. Most of the discussion has centered on how much it would cost to implement Medicare for All and not enough on how this would impact patients directly.

As a Canadian physician, and one who works in a single-payer model, I believe it is imperative to present to patients the many benefits of a transition to a Canadian-style model, such as cheaper prices for drugs such as insulin, along with the potential pitfalls of such a system, so that voters are better able to make an informed decision at the ballot box.

The non-partisan Commonwealth Fund has ranked a number of health care systems with single-payer models -- including that of Canada -- as consistently among the worst of 11 OECD nations on patient outcomes, access and equity. Interestingly, even those who study health care systems have been reluctant to endorse a single-payer model.

Part of this stems from the fact that close to 5 million Canadians, roughly 13% of the population, currently don't have a family doctor. Compounding this problem are the soaring specialist wait times that are unfortunately becoming a hallmark of our health care system. Sadly, the shuttering of clinics and rationing of care is happening at alarming rates in Canada.

The reason for this is a combination of factors that includes the unique situation of physicians being treated as independent private contractors. This means doctors bill the government for their services rendered to patients, but in many circumstances are responsible for setting up their own clinics, having to pay the cost of rent, utilities, medical supplies and other human resources overhead.

In this paradigm , the government sets a ceiling for physician billings. With increased costs, many physicians have decided to reduce their hours, work part-time, cease practicing and retire.

Moreover, it is also not uncommon for my patients to wait over a year from the moment I refer them to an orthopedic surgeon to the time they receive the appropriate workup, imaging and are ultimately operated upon.

This is happening amid a doctor shortage in Canada where, paradoxically, newly qualified primary and specialist physicians -- many of whom I know personally and trained alongside -- are having trouble finding work. It is increasingly challenging for new graduates to find jobs in specialty care centers, which often have restrictions on the number of full-time hires that can be employed.

All of this helps explain why nearly 200,000 Canadians travel abroad annually for health care services.

Nevertheless, there is a valid argument to be made in the United States about reducing per capita spending on health care to align with rates in other nations . Administrative costs in Canada are much lower than in the United States , and physicians don't have to navigate labyrinthine payment structures with multiple insurance companies.

Most importantly, patients are also not being bankrupted for merely needing health care services.

However, Sen. Warren's plan to put pressure on the supply side of the health care industry may serve to alienate providers who will make decisions based on economic considerations. In other words, by squeezing providers and hospitals, a government-administered system will reduce incentives to see patients and exacerbate the epidemic of burnout within health care communities.

There is no perfect health care system. In the same way that many would describe the American system as too beholden to greedy insurance companies, one might argue that an unyielding adherence to a single-payer philosophy has also prevented desperately needed reform in Canada.

The best answer probably lies somewhere in between, and the Goldilocks approach is something to which Americans should give serious consideration. Blended health care models -- that is, mixtures of public and private payer options -- have a track record of success around the world, which is why strengthening of Obamacare and a fill-in-the-gaps plan is likely to be the most realistic, methodical and cost-effective way of improving upon a system in dire need of reform."

Politico’s Ryan Lizza writes:

“Sometimes [Obama] offers candid advice about his visitors’ strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely “too late” for him to secure “money and talent” if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Obama’s remarks about Biden’s issues in Hawkeye State are reflected in his falling poll numbers. “According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is down eight points in Iowa from June to November to leave him tied with Senator Bernie Sanders at 22% as the top choice among registered Iowa Democrats. They were just ahead of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (18%). Other recent polls have shown Biden polling as low as fourth within that top tier, CBS News said.

Obama’s brutal assessment of Biden’s performance on the trail, which has been a constant source of concern for Democratic Party officials and primary voters, is sure to add to the narrative that the former president has little — if any — faith in his former number two’s ability to secure the nomination. Obama infamously did not endorse Biden’s latest White House bid. In a 60 Minutes interview, the former vice president claimed Obama’s silence was at his own request. “I asked him not to,” Biden said. “I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.”

While Lizza acknowledges this public statement, he writes that Biden “wanted a nudge” and was “infuriated” by the former president’s reclusive approach to this political cycle.

News of Obama’s criticisms about Biden comes as the former president has become more vocal about the 2020 primary content.

Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) can defeat President Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

She's authored the institute's annual ""Executive Excess"" report on CEO pay for over two decades. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

I moved away from my hometown of Litchfield, Minnesota, several decades ago, and since that time, my politics have veered to the left as those in my hometown have veered to the right. Donald Trump won my family's western Minnesota congressional district by over 30 percentage points .

And yet, when I visit the church bazaars and county fairs or attend family reunions in my hometown, we always find common ground when it comes to wealth-hoarding corporate CEOs.

So I'm not surprised by national polls showing that both Democrats and Republicans have had it with CEO greed. Some 78% of US workers feel CEOs are overpaid compared to their employees, one poll found last year.

It may be even worse than they think.

A Harvard Business School study found that Americans think the right CEO-worker pay ratio is no higher than 7 to 1 . But a report I co-authored for the Institute for Policy Studies found that 80% of S&P 500 firms paid their CEO over 100 times more than their median worker last year.

In many cases, it was well more than 1,000 times.

All this could mean bipartisan traction for a new bill introduced by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Barbara Lee earlier this month. It would raise the federal corporate income tax rate on companies that pay their CEOs more than 50 times their median workers' pay.

The bigger the gap, the bigger the hike. At a 50-to-1 gap, the tax goes up by half a percentage point. At 500-to-1, firms would see their tax bills jump by 5 full percentage points. That might be enough to get corporate boards to rethink how much they pay their top executives — and how little they pay their workers.

Could Republicans like my old Minnesota neighbors get on board? It sure seems like it.

As recently as 2016, a Stanford University survey found that over half of Republicans — a full 52%— favor an outright cap on CEO compensation relative to worker pay. That's even more radical than what Sanders, Warren, Tlaib and Lee have proposed, since their bill would tax — but not prohibit — those offensive pay gaps.

Several prominent Republican politicians have weighed in to support restraining executive pay excess.

Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff, has a record on the issue too. Before he left Congress, Mulvaney introduced an amendment to eliminate US Export-Import Bank subsidies for any company with a CEO that's paid more than 100 times the median worker pay.

Of course, neither Trump nor Mulvaney has done much to turn those proposals into law. But while the 2017 GOP tax cuts Trump signed were otherwise a huge gift to the wealthy, they did close one perverse loophole that had encouraged excessive CEO pay. Before this change, corporations could deduct unlimited amounts of executive pay from their federal tax bills, as long as they labeled that pay ""performance-based.""

Just as cigarette taxes have helped reduce smoking rates while generating revenue for health programs, a pay gap tax could incentivize less harmful corporate executive behavior while raising revenue that could be used to reduce inequality. If the new bill's penalties had been in place last year, S&P 500 firms with pay gaps over 100-to-1 would have owed as much as $17.2 billion in additional federal taxes.

Folks in my hometown would approve. Maybe even cheer."

1. Impeachment investigation

It may be a slow holiday work week for some, but two major court decisions made for a busy day on Capitol Hill . A federal judge said former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before the House of Representatives . McGahn and others have said they don't need to comply with congressional calls to testify because they have blanket immunity as White House officials. ""Presidents are not kings,"" wrote federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, saying high-ranking officials are not immune and must testify when compelled by the legislative process. Not only is this a win for Democrats, who have been trying to get McGahn to talk for months, it also has big implications for other resistant officials, like chief of staff Mick Mulvaney or even President Trump himself, who could be forced to testify if more judges agree with yesterday's ruling. However, Dems should temper their optimism: Also yesterday, the Supreme Court blocked the House's subpoena of Trump's financial records . Still, House Democrats are chugging along with impeachment articles , which may expand past the Ukraine scandal.

Michael Bloomberg is officially running for president. The former New York mayor kicked off his campaign and said Trump is less likely to get reelected with him in the race. That's a pretty clear knock on the other Democratic candidates, whom Bloomberg sees as unable to defeat Trump. The media billionaire has already bought $37 million worth of campaign ads over the next two weeks, which has led Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic candidates to accuse him of trying to ""buy the nomination."" Bloomberg said he knows ""what it takes to beat Trump because I already have,"" referring to personal investments in Democratic gun and climate efforts. If Bloomberg were to win, the 2020 election would pit two established New York City rich guys who've both been accused of using wealth and name recognition for political gain.

4. China, Uber, Tiffany

Three major moves have dominated the business world , so let's round them up:

China extended an olive branch on the trade front by rolling out new guidelines about intellectual property. There aren't too many details yet, but the measures could address longtime concerns from Washington and pave the way for a possible trade truce.

London stripped Uber of its license to operate in the city. The shocking decision is a huge blow to the company, given that London is one of its biggest markets. London's transportation agency concluded Uber is ""not fit and proper"" to operate due to lapses in passenger safety measures after it found 14,000 recent trips involved unauthorized drivers. Uber will appeal.

• French luxury group LVMH finalized a deal to buy New York jeweler Tiffany & Co., putting the value of the company at $16.2 billion. It's one of the biggest deals ever in the luxury sector , and the news sent Tiffany's stock soaring.

Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin won a reindeer and named it Ingemar

Photos: Shiffrin's career so far American skier Mikaela Shiffrin is arguably the most dominant athlete in sport right now. The 24-year-old has taken skiing by storm, winning 17 World Cup races across four of the six disciplines last season to take her overall tally to 60 victories. Here's a look back at her short but sweet career so far. Hide Caption 1 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2011 – Shiffrin grew up skiing from an early age thanks to parents who were both competitive college skiers. She rose quickly through the junior ranks and joined the World Cup circuit two days before her 16th birthday in 2011. Hide Caption 2 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2011 – The American (right) secured her first World Cup medal in December 2011, winning a bronze in the slalom. Her potential didn't go unnoticed as she was named rookie of the year.

Hide Caption 5 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2013 – She ended a remarkable season with a first World Cup slalom crown, which she defended the following year. Hide Caption 6 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2014 – As world champion, the pressure was on the 18-year-old to perform at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. She didn't disappoint. Shiffrin became the youngest ever Olympic slalom champion and the first American to win the title in 42 years. Hide Caption 7 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2015 – Following her Olympic success, the American won her third straight World Cup slalom crown in 2015. She also defended her slalom title at the 2015 World Championships.

Hide Caption 9 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2017 – Shiffrin was back to her best in 2017, though, winning a fifth slalom World Cup title and adding a third World Championship gold. She also won her first overall World Cup title. Hide Caption 10 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2018 – As her reputation grew, so did her popularity and all eyes were on Shiffrin to perform at the 2018 Winter Olympics. She was affected by the weather-hit schedule and despite winning gold in the giant slalom and silver in the combined she missed out completely in slalom. But she won the World Cup overall and slalom titles again at the end of the season to confirm her status as America's new superstar. Hide Caption 11 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far Shiffrin has been on fire during the 2018-19 season and has made waves beyond ski racing for her level of consistency and domination.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads in the Democrat primary among LGBT voters, a YouGov and Out magazine poll revealed.

YouGov and Out magazine collaborated to examine the Democrat primary preferences of LGBT voters, surveying 816 likely voters November 11-18. Respondents overwhelmingly chose Warren as their candidate of choice. She bested Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who came in second place, by double digits.

The Massachusetts senator garnered 31 percent support, followed by Sanders with 18 percent support, former Vice President Joe Biden (D) with 16 percent support, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with 14 percent support. Buttigieg’s fourth-place status is significant, as he is the only self-proclaimed member of the LGBT community in the race.

The remainder of the candidates saw single-digit support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) garnered six percent support, followed by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent support. Andrew Yang (D), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro (D) saw two percent support. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less.

YouGov Blue Vice President Alissa Stollwerk told Out:

Seventy-seven percent of LGBTQ+ Democratic primary voters identified in our survey as very or somewhat liberal, approximately 20 percentage points higher than the percentage of Democratic primary voters overall who identify as very or somewhat liberal in our surveys.

Out attributes Warren’s popularity among the LGBT community to her prioritization of LGBT issues – something she has incorporated into the bulk of her plans. For instance, she emphasized LGBT protections as part of her criminal justice reform plan and has called for “high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care.” She also floated mixed prisons as part of her “LGBTQ+ Rights and Equality” plan.

Stollwerk continued:

Any survey is a snapshot of a group of people at a given time. However, as far as we know, this is the first survey of likely Democratic primary voters who identify as LGBTQ+, and it hopefully will help people understand the viewpoints of these Democratic voters, what issues are important to them, and what they want to see in the next Democratic nominee for president.

More per Out:

The results themselves show the relationship between Warren and LGBTQ+ voters likely goes deeper than partisanship. She had the highest favorable ratings among candidates by a 10-point margin, with 54 percent viewing her highly favorably. Meanwhile, survey respondents also felt she had the best chance to beat President Donald Trump in a general election: 53 percent felt she could do so, followed by Biden (52 percent), Sanders (46 percent), and Buttigieg (29 percent). But if the survey is good news for the Warren campaign, the results should be a cause for concern in the Biden camp. His unfavorables among LGBTQ+ voters were disproportionately high: 33 percent of respondents viewed him highly or somewhat unfavorably, a greater percentage than every other candidate except for Gabbard and Williamson. They both netted 38 percent unfavorable ratings.

Warren has been very vocal in her support for the LGBT community on the campaign trail, even thanking drag queen Shea Couleé for “representing” Team Warren at RuPaul’s DragCon in September."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) kicked off her campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, on Monday by blasting Michael Bloomberg and his “version of democracy,” arguing that he is not relying on people but “bags and bags of money” to “buy the nomination.”

Warren, a fierce critic of Bloomberg, kicked off a town hall meeting in Ankeny, Iowa, by addressing the billionaire’s entry into the race.

“So I am here during day two of Michael Bloomberg’s 37 million dollar ad buy,” Warren said. “Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about Democracy in 2020. He doesn’t need people. He only needs bags and bags of money.”

She added that it is precisely how he “plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party:”

His view is that he doesn’t need people who knock on doors. He doesn’t need to get out and campaign with people. He doesn’t need volunteers. And if you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he’ll just spend another $37 million to flood the airwaves.

“I think this is fundamentally wrong,” Warren said, warning that if Bloomberg’s “version of democracy wins,” it will fundamentally change democracy as we know it.

“It’s going to be about which billionaire can you stomach going forward. Because believe me, there are plenty of billionaires who think they should be president, or the minimum, should be picking the president,” she said:

Sen. Warren on Bloomberg entering the race: ""His view is that he doesn't need people who knock on doors … If you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he'll just spend another $37M to flood the airwaves — and that's how he plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party."" pic.twitter.com/nH6xY7Jppm — NBC News (@NBCNews) November 25, 2019

Many Warren allies view Bloomberg’s late entry into the race as a positive for the Massachusetts senator, noting that he encapsulates precisely what Warren claims she is campaigning against.

“This may be one of the most important things that happened to her campaign,” Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green said, according to the Daily Beast.

“Bloomberg’s entrance centers the conversation to the core themes that have been instrumental to Elizabeth Warren’s rise,” he continued, noting “the systemic corruption of our democracy by billionaires,” specifically.

Bloomberg, thus far, has spent more time focusing on President Trump as opposed to his immediate Democrat competitors.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” he states on his campaign website.

“We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he continues, calling Trump an “existential threat to our country and our values.”

“If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage,” he warns. “The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America.”

Bloomberg is expected to virtually ignore the first four states in the Democrat Primary – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – and focus on Super Tuesday instead."

The survey showed former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leading, a consistent trend in this particular national poll, with 30 percent support.

“Biden is back on top of the pack but now there is a 3-way race for second,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.

“Buttigieg has broken into the top tier, apparently at the expense of Warren, who has taken a dive after being hammered for being too far left on health care and other issues,” he added.

According to the survey, 35 percent of voters say a candidate’s ability to win in a general election matchup is the most important factor a potential nominee can possess. On that front, Biden leads, with 46 percent of Democrat and Democrat-leaning independent voters viewing him as the best bet to defeat President Trump.

The survey also found that Medicare for All, a proposal touted by both Sanders and Warren, is growing “increasingly unpopular among all American voters,” which could explain Buttigieg’s ability to catch up to them in the polls.

According to Quinnipiac, “36 percent say it is a good idea and 52 percent say it is a bad idea.”"

Two of the candidates seem to be the ones whose campaign promises imply Obama didn’t do enough to advance progressivism while in office — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT):

Publicly, he has been clear that he won’t intervene in the primary for or against a candidate, unless he believed there was some egregious attack. “I can’t even imagine with this field how bad it would have to be for him to say something,” said a close adviser. Instead, he sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear. There is one potential exception: Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him. (Asked about that, a spokesperson for Obama pointed out that Obama recently said he would support and campaign for whoever the Democratic nominee is.) If Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don’t think that’s likely. It’s not happening.” (Another close Obama friend said, “Bernie’s not a Democrat.”) As for Warren, the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama, Obama’s relationship with Warren is famously complicated. Back in early 2015, when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives, Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him—a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate. There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren’s campaign.

As for the other candidates, little support can be found from the former president.

“Obama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” one of Obama’s “closest advisers” said in the article.

“They discussed doubts about Kamala Harris’ appeal to African Americans,” the article said.

As for Steve Bullock, Obama spoke for himself: “Nobody knows who you are,” he said.

Obama adviser David Axelrod said, “I mean is Michael Bloomberg really the default candidate for non-college educated white voters?”

“Maybe Amy [Klobuchar], but I honestly don’t think she’s getting out of Iowa,” Axelrod said.

The article tries to paint Obama as a moderate compared to this field of candidates, including Warren and Sanders and their Medicare for All schemes. He is more favorable of former Vice President Joe Biden’s and Buttigieg’s healthcare plans.

But that’s not to say Obama is ready to buy any bumper stickers.

“Another adviser added, ‘I don’t think he was trying to benefit Biden here. Buttigieg benefits from this too. Knowing Obama as well as I do, he doesn’t want to help anyone or hurt anyone, he just wants to win the 2020 election,’” the article said.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is only mentioned once in the article as one of the candidates who has sought advice from Obama.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 14 percent, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D) closely behind with 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

While six points separate the remainder of the candidates from the top tier, Gabbard finds herself in fifth place with six percent support – two points ahead of Andrew Yang and three points ahead of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). They garnered four percent and three percent, respectively.

The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.4 percent, signaling a statistical tie among the top tier candidates. What is more, 21 percent of respondents indicated that they are “undecided,” and only 43 percent indicated that their “minds were made up”:

According to the Boston Globe, “support for Sanders and Warren was essentially unchanged from the last Suffolk/Globe poll in August,” but Biden “lost 9 percentage points, while Buttigieg gained 7 points.”

The poll reflects the increased skepticism of Biden’s viability among Democrat voters.

“I had pretty high hopes for Joe Biden. I wanted to like him and vote for him because of his time with the Obama administration and I thought he had the experience,” one voter, Michael Mahany, 61, told the Boston Globe.

“But he just hasn’t had his stuff together, and he just hasn’t stepped up in the debates and I am not sure he ever will now,” he added.

The poll also found that Gabbard is appealing to moderate voters in the Granite State:

The survey found Gabbard does better among men and moderates. And far more than any other candidate, her supporters said that if Gabbard doesn’t become the nominee, they will consider voting for Trump or for a third-party candidate: “I liked Tulsi more after Clinton attacked her,” said Mark Gold, a 58-year-old computer consultant who lives in Concord. “The Democratic Party appears to like to manipulate things for their preferred candidate and I think that demonstrated she is different.”

“The narrative is changing in New Hampshire,” Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said, noting the ongoing battle between the New England senators.

“Now, add to that the war between Buttigieg and Biden,” he added."

The endorsement, Buttigieg's second in the past two days, comes as the Democratic presidential candidate has surged to the top of the field in Iowa and has seen his poll numbers rise in New Hampshire. Despite his improved standing in the race, Buttigieg still lags behind his top competitors in congressional endorsements.

Rice said in an interview on Monday that she is backing Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination because he is the ""only candidate whose message is focused on addressing both our long term and short-term challenges that we face.""

""The thing that I admire about him is that he's done it not by over promising things and pandering to the base and he doesn't use divisive rhetoric or my way or the highway approach,"" Rice said, in a thinly veiled swipe at Buttigieg's more progressive competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. ""He's really demonstrated an unmatched ability and a willingness to reach voters where they are from across the political spectrum.""

Rice told CNN's Bianna Golodryga on ""CNN Right Now"" Buttigieg ""gives a message that resonates with everyone across this country.""

(CNN) Last-minute presidential candidates such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , a managing director at Bain Capital, have entered the race in an effort to promote moderation and defeat progressive Democratic candidates who Wall Street fears.

But the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt is actually poised to return to its roots in the real center of mainstream public opinion, in which people believe in an active role for government to improve their lives. In this presidential election season, the party could reclaim the mantle of protecting working people, the middle class and the poor at a time of gaping wealth inequality, when popular opinion increasingly believes billionaires have too much, corporations pay too little in taxes and ordinary people are suffering.

This is why, contrary to the concerns of some political leaders and pundits, most prominently former President Barack Obama, the Democratic Party does not risk veering too far to the left.

At a recent event with wealthy donors, Obama claimed the ""average American"" does not want to ""completely tear down the system and remake it,"" and America ""is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.""

Despite running for president and energizing the nation just a decade ago as a center-left candidate with a message of hope and change, Obama seems to think America does not need systemic change, and Democrats should not rock the boat or make any sudden moves.

Democrats on Twitter who reject Obama's warning not to move too far left responded to the former president's comments with the hashtag #TooFarLeft, which at the time became the top trending tag in the US and the third globally, according to Democratic strategist Peter Daou

Daou, who started the hashtag, wanted to eviscerate the mainstream talking point that social, economic, racial and environmental justice is somehow a radical position.

Indeed, considering the state of the country, its festering political, economic and social problems and the seeming inability of government to address them, Daou and others who have embraced the hashtag make a good point. America is not well, and ignoring the symptoms of what ails the nation -- not pushing too far for change -- is what gave us Donald Trump.

Consider the status quo with rising inequality, low taxation on the wealthy and corporations, and the dimming life prospects of millennials.

Earning less money and saddled with more debt than their parents, young people in America, one study finds , cannot afford their health-care needs and are on a trajectory for a shorter life span than generations before them. According to the study, millennials are facing more chronic health issues, depression and suicide than Gen Xers due to the economic crisis, student debt, the opioid crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other issues. The impending health crisis is eroding the earning potential of this younger generation.

Wall Street is frightened at the prospect of a progressive in the mold of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, and some billionaires are having a temper tantrum because they refuse to pay their fair share of taxes.

A number of big money Democratic donors have vowed to sit out or support Trump if Warren receives the nomination. Bill Gates seemingly has not ruled out voting for Trump if he would otherwise be forced to pay Warren's wealth tax.

Establishment and Wall Street Dems are misreading the winds of public sentiment if they believe moderation is a winning political strategy for 2020. There is no constituency for a presidential candidate who prescribes half-measures to put out a fire.

And polling indicates that.

For example, a 2019 Quinnipiac poll found that 60% of registered voters support a 2% wealth tax on people who own assets over $50 million. The wealth tax concept enjoys support across political parties and all demographic groups.

Further, according to a KFF Health Tracking Poll, health care is the leading issue that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the presidential candidates to discuss. Further, according to a poll earlier this year from Politico and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Republicans believe it is ""extremely important"" for Congress to tackle student debt.

Even while acknowledging the historic diversity in the Democratic field, Obama urges that candidates rein in their messaging.

""We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election -- just like I did,"" Obama said at another event . ""You can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, 'Look, I'm part of an American tradition ... of opening up opportunity.'""

The former president is mistaken if he believes that in appealing to the electorate, Democrats must tamp down their message and advocate for tweaks in the system rather than systemic reform. This, in a country that touts itself as the ""land of opportunity,"" yet has one of the lowest rates of socioeconomic mobility

The party of FDR could very well inspire and energize Americans looking for change with policy prescriptions such as Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and free college."

No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate . A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.

The findings suggest slight declines in support for Biden and Warren since October, and a modest increase in backing for Buttigieg. Sanders' support remains about the same as it was in October.

A majority of potential Democratic voters remain uncertain about their choices. Just 42% say they have definitely decided on their candidates, about the same as in October, and Biden continues to have an edge among that group of committed voters.

Asked who they would choose if the race came down to the top four instead of the 18 major candidates currently in the running, the order at the top remains the same. Biden continues to hold a lead -- 35% say they would choose him -- with 23% choosing Sanders, 20% Warren and 17% Buttigieg.

Buttigieg's bump in the poll coincides with a well-received debate performance , with 22% who watched or followed news coverage about last week's debate saying he had the best night. Biden lands in second at 16%, Sanders at 10%, Harris and Warren each at 8% and Booker at 5%.

Most potential Democratic voters say they prefer a candidate who aims for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if they wouldn't make major changes, over a candidate who aims for policies that would make larger changes (56% feel that way, 36% prefer a candidate who shoots for major change). But when asked which candidate would best handle specific issues, potential Democratic voters are more closely divided between those seeking big changes and those aiming for more incremental progress.

On health care, 28% say Sanders -- an advocate of ""Medicare for All"" and the elimination of private health insurance -- would best handle the issue. That's about even with the 26% who choose Biden, who has argued against moving to a completely government-run system. Another 19% say they prefer Warren's approach, which ultimately results in government health coverage for all, while 7% choose Buttigieg, and no other candidate has the backing of more than 3% on the issue.

Sanders leads the way more clearly on handling the climate crisis: 27% favor his approach, followed by 21% who prefer Biden and 15% Warren.

Biden holds an edge on the economy, though by a narrower margin than he did in October. About 3 in 10 (29%) prefer him on the issue, down from 38% last month, with Warren at 19% and Sanders at 17%. Buttigieg lands at 7% and Yang at 5% on the issue.

Biden has lost some ground as most trusted on almost all the issues tested, while Buttigieg has made gains nearly across the board.

More potential Democratic voters see Biden as capable of managing the government effectively (86%) than say the same about Sanders (73%), Warren (73%) or Buttigieg (54%). Biden also tops the leading candidates on being able to unite the country rather than divide it (73% say so, vs. 65% for Sanders, 58% for Warren and 54% for Buttigieg).

Sanders (66%), Biden (64%) and Warren (61%) are all closely clustered on being able to bring needed change, with Buttigieg a bit behind at 54%.

Warren holds a clear advantage on having the stamina and sharpness to be president -- 81% say that describes her, compared with 66% for Buttigieg, 65% for Biden and 58% for Sanders.

Sanders' strength is being seen as honest and trustworthy. Nearly 9 in 10 potential Democratic voters (89%) call Sanders honest and trustworthy, vs. 78% for Warren, 75% for Biden and 64% for Buttigieg. That carries through among all adults as well. Overall, 62% see Sanders as honest and trustworthy, making him the only candidate of the top four Democrats plus President Donald Trump who is seen that way by a majority of Americans.

All four tested Democratic candidates outpace Trump on two measures: honesty (62% Sanders, 49% Warren, 47% Biden, 45% Buttigieg, 36% Trump) and uniting the country rather than dividing it (47% Biden, 44% Sanders, 37% Warren, 35% Buttigieg, 31% Trump).

Trump ties Sanders at the top on being able to bring needed change (43% each, followed by Biden at 40%, Warren at 39%, Buttigieg at 35%). Biden leads the field on managing the government effectively (55% Biden, 46% Sanders, 44% Warren, 42% Trump, 36% Buttigieg). While Warren takes the lead on having the stamina and sharpness for the presidency (54% describe Warren that way, 47% Trump, 46% Buttigieg, 44% Biden and 40% Sanders).

One caveat on these figures: A large number (roughly a quarter across attributes) say they are unsure how to answer about Buttigieg. For the other candidates, that number was in the single digits across the board.

Health care (46% extremely important) and gun policy (44% extremely important) continue to rank at the top of voters' issue concerns for 2020. The impeachment inquiry into Trump ranks near the bottom, with 27% calling that extremely important. That rises a bit to 39% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, but dips to just 15% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters."

""Everyone without health insurance is guaranteed to get it, and everyone who likes theirs can go ahead and keep it,"" the ad says -- an indirect if obvious attack on ""Medicare for All,"" the single-payer health care plan, and political flashpoint, that would ultimately eliminate private insurers.

Bloomberg is a longshot to win or meaningfully compete for the Democratic nomination, but his decision to run immediately blew open the party's battle over the influence of money, and the wealthiest Americans, on the political system. For Sanders and Warren, Bloomberg's campaign brings with it both an opportunity to sharpen their messages and an existential new threat: a billionaire prepared to reach deep into his near bottomless pockets in an effort to derail them, their agenda and a style of politics that more deeply engages the electorate.

The progressive senators, who have forsworn big dollar contributions, condemned Bloomberg out of the gate, with Sanders last week calling the billionaire businessman's initial outlay an attempt to ""circumvent the political process."" Absent grassroots support, Sanders said, candidates like Bloomberg had ""no business running for president."" Bloomberg has said he won't take any donations, a step to signal his independence, but one that his rivals argue effectively cuts him off from accountability to voters.

A few days later, Warren took the unusual-for-her step of calling out Bloomberg by name in Iowa.

""I am here on Day 2 of Michael Bloomberg's $37 million ad buy,"" Warren said to laughter in Ankeny on Monday. ""Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020 -- he doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money.""

Contrasting her grassroots-style campaign with Bloomberg's plans to bombard the airwaves, Warren laid out the progressive movement's view of the fight at hand.

The question, she said, is ""which vision of our democracy, which version of our democracy, is going to win. And if Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes and it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward.""

Warren's team took her remarks and cut them into an online video , which it tweeted out a few hours later. Online, at the campaign store, her ""Billionaire Tears"" mug is still for sale.

Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Sanders kept up his own attacks on Bloomberg.

""I understand the power of the '1%,'"" he said at a rally in New Hampshire. ""You're seeing that right now literally with Mayor Bloomberg, who has decided to use part of his 55 billion dollars not to buy a yacht, not to buy another home, not to buy a fancy car, but to buy the United States government.""

The Democratic Party has, over decades, become more and more welcoming, and in many cases dependent, on contributions from big business interests and wealthy donors. Even amid a progressive resurgence that has made it less politically palatable for Democrats to accept money from corporate PACs or lobbyists, billionaires like Bloomberg -- who has given prodigiously to an assortment of liberal causes, most notably in forming his gun control organization -- have largely avoided the scorn directed at conservative benefactors like the Koch Brothers.

Tom Steyer, the other billionaire vying for the nomination, effectively bought his way onto the debate stage by paying for ads soliciting donations. But his smaller fortune -- in the most relative terms -- and lower national profile has made him a less appealing foil for progressive activists, who in many cases have come to see him as a reliable ally.

Bloomberg does not have the same kind of cred. His no-donor pledge, which follows a blueprint similar to the one he followed during his time as mayor, has only stoked anger on the left.

""I will be the only candidate in this race who isn't corruptible, who isn't going to take a penny from anyone, and will work for a dollar a year,"" he said in Phoenix on Tuesday, after filing for Arizona's state primary. But for progressives critics, including Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, that misses the point.

Bloomberg ""says, 'Oh, I'm not going to take a salary because I can't be bought,"" Shakir said during a livestreamed briefing for supporters later on Tuesday. ""Well, that's just because you're not accountable to the American people.""

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in her famous 2018 viral ad said her primary against one of the party's most formidable fundraisers was ""about people versus money: we've got people, they've got money,"" put Bloomberg at the center of a recent fundraising appeal for Sanders.

""Bloomberg is launching his presidential bid. His plan? Dump piles of cash on the media. Typical billionaire move,"" she wrote, the email's subject line filled only with an eye-roll emoji, before offering a sense of just how much Bloomberg was spending. ""Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders would need 1.7 million of us to donate his average contribution -- $18 -- to match one week of Bloomberg's TV buy.""

Sanders and Warren have both rooted their campaigns in an argument that, as Warren puts it, ""the wealthy and well-connected"" hold an outsize and insidiously damaging grip on elections and the actions -- or inaction -- of government.

In a February speech inaugurating her presidential bid, Warren laid blame for the historic levels of economic inequality at the feet of the ""richest and most powerful people in America."" She also predicted, with history as her guide, how the pushback to her message would sound.

""When I talk about this stuff, someone screams 'class warfare,'"" Warren said. ""Well let me tell you something. These same rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard-working people for decades. I say it's time to fight back.""

Sanders, who has been campaigning against ""the billionaire class"" for decades, made the point bluntly in an August tweet.

""If there is going to be class warfare in this country,"" Sanders wrote , ""it's about time the working class won that war.""

Micah Uetricht, an editor at Jacobin, the socialist magazine, grabbed and reproduced the tweet in sticker form, selling 500 within 24 hours and donating the proceeds -- after printing up another thousand -- to the campaign. A few months later, this past Sunday, the Sanders team in a fundraising email offered up a similar deal to a much wider audience.

""Contribute any amount,"" they wrote to supporters, ""and get our 'Class Warfare' sticker."""

In poll after poll (including this one), they list beating Trump as a bigger priority for their primary than a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.

Figuring out which Democrat is the most electable is no easy task, however.

One thought I had was to see what quality is best correlated with Trump’s approval rating and then see which Democrats scored best on it. The problem is that there are two variables (being able to bring about change the country needs and can manage government effectively) that are highly correlated, and they give us very different answers on potential electability.

Biden is the only Democrat who a majority of voters (55%) say can manage the government effectively. All the other Democrats have a similar net score (those who say they can minus those who say they can't) to one another.

Yet, Biden has the worst spread on being a change agent (40% say yes compared to 55% who say no). Buttigieg and Sanders have the best net scores at -6 points and -7 points, respectively.

This, of course, is the fundamental issue Democratic primary voters face in 2020. If this is a change election, then Biden is likely not going to be the most electable candidate. If, however, voters end up wanting someone they think can right the ship from an unorthodox Trump presidency, Biden’s the right guy."

Politico’s Ryan Lizza writes:

“Sometimes [Obama] offers candid advice about his visitors’ strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely “too late” for him to secure “money and talent” if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Obama’s remarks about Biden’s issues in Hawkeye State are reflected in his falling poll numbers. “According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is down eight points in Iowa from June to November to leave him tied with Senator Bernie Sanders at 22% as the top choice among registered Iowa Democrats. They were just ahead of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (18%). Other recent polls have shown Biden polling as low as fourth within that top tier, CBS News said.

Obama’s brutal assessment of Biden’s performance on the trail, which has been a constant source of concern for Democratic Party officials and primary voters, is sure to add to the narrative that the former president has little — if any — faith in his former number two’s ability to secure the nomination. Obama infamously did not endorse Biden’s latest White House bid. In a 60 Minutes interview, the former vice president claimed Obama’s silence was at his own request. “I asked him not to,” Biden said. “I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.”

While Lizza acknowledges this public statement, he writes that Biden “wanted a nudge” and was “infuriated” by the former president’s reclusive approach to this political cycle.

News of Obama’s criticisms about Biden comes as the former president has become more vocal about the 2020 primary content.

Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) can defeat President Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

She's authored the institute's annual ""Executive Excess"" report on CEO pay for over two decades. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

I moved away from my hometown of Litchfield, Minnesota, several decades ago, and since that time, my politics have veered to the left as those in my hometown have veered to the right. Donald Trump won my family's western Minnesota congressional district by over 30 percentage points .

And yet, when I visit the church bazaars and county fairs or attend family reunions in my hometown, we always find common ground when it comes to wealth-hoarding corporate CEOs.

So I'm not surprised by national polls showing that both Democrats and Republicans have had it with CEO greed. Some 78% of US workers feel CEOs are overpaid compared to their employees, one poll found last year.

It may be even worse than they think.

A Harvard Business School study found that Americans think the right CEO-worker pay ratio is no higher than 7 to 1 . But a report I co-authored for the Institute for Policy Studies found that 80% of S&P 500 firms paid their CEO over 100 times more than their median worker last year.

In many cases, it was well more than 1,000 times.

All this could mean bipartisan traction for a new bill introduced by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Barbara Lee earlier this month. It would raise the federal corporate income tax rate on companies that pay their CEOs more than 50 times their median workers' pay.

The bigger the gap, the bigger the hike. At a 50-to-1 gap, the tax goes up by half a percentage point. At 500-to-1, firms would see their tax bills jump by 5 full percentage points. That might be enough to get corporate boards to rethink how much they pay their top executives — and how little they pay their workers.

Could Republicans like my old Minnesota neighbors get on board? It sure seems like it.

As recently as 2016, a Stanford University survey found that over half of Republicans — a full 52%— favor an outright cap on CEO compensation relative to worker pay. That's even more radical than what Sanders, Warren, Tlaib and Lee have proposed, since their bill would tax — but not prohibit — those offensive pay gaps.

Several prominent Republican politicians have weighed in to support restraining executive pay excess.

Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff, has a record on the issue too. Before he left Congress, Mulvaney introduced an amendment to eliminate US Export-Import Bank subsidies for any company with a CEO that's paid more than 100 times the median worker pay.

Of course, neither Trump nor Mulvaney has done much to turn those proposals into law. But while the 2017 GOP tax cuts Trump signed were otherwise a huge gift to the wealthy, they did close one perverse loophole that had encouraged excessive CEO pay. Before this change, corporations could deduct unlimited amounts of executive pay from their federal tax bills, as long as they labeled that pay ""performance-based.""

Just as cigarette taxes have helped reduce smoking rates while generating revenue for health programs, a pay gap tax could incentivize less harmful corporate executive behavior while raising revenue that could be used to reduce inequality. If the new bill's penalties had been in place last year, S&P 500 firms with pay gaps over 100-to-1 would have owed as much as $17.2 billion in additional federal taxes.

Folks in my hometown would approve. Maybe even cheer."

1. Impeachment investigation

It may be a slow holiday work week for some, but two major court decisions made for a busy day on Capitol Hill . A federal judge said former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before the House of Representatives . McGahn and others have said they don't need to comply with congressional calls to testify because they have blanket immunity as White House officials. ""Presidents are not kings,"" wrote federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, saying high-ranking officials are not immune and must testify when compelled by the legislative process. Not only is this a win for Democrats, who have been trying to get McGahn to talk for months, it also has big implications for other resistant officials, like chief of staff Mick Mulvaney or even President Trump himself, who could be forced to testify if more judges agree with yesterday's ruling. However, Dems should temper their optimism: Also yesterday, the Supreme Court blocked the House's subpoena of Trump's financial records . Still, House Democrats are chugging along with impeachment articles , which may expand past the Ukraine scandal.

3. 2020 Dems

Michael Bloomberg is officially running for president. The former New York mayor kicked off his campaign and said Trump is less likely to get reelected with him in the race. That's a pretty clear knock on the other Democratic candidates, whom Bloomberg sees as unable to defeat Trump. The media billionaire has already bought $37 million worth of campaign ads over the next two weeks, which has led Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic candidates to accuse him of trying to ""buy the nomination."" Bloomberg said he knows ""what it takes to beat Trump because I already have,"" referring to personal investments in Democratic gun and climate efforts. If Bloomberg were to win, the 2020 election would pit two established New York City rich guys who've both been accused of using wealth and name recognition for political gain.

4. China, Uber, Tiffany

Three major moves have dominated the business world , so let's round them up:

China extended an olive branch on the trade front by rolling out new guidelines about intellectual property. There aren't too many details yet, but the measures could address longtime concerns from Washington and pave the way for a possible trade truce.

London stripped Uber of its license to operate in the city. The shocking decision is a huge blow to the company, given that London is one of its biggest markets. London's transportation agency concluded Uber is ""not fit and proper"" to operate due to lapses in passenger safety measures after it found 14,000 recent trips involved unauthorized drivers. Uber will appeal.

• French luxury group LVMH finalized a deal to buy New York jeweler Tiffany & Co., putting the value of the company at $16.2 billion. It's one of the biggest deals ever in the luxury sector , and the news sent Tiffany's stock soaring.

Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin won a reindeer and named it Ingemar

Photos: Shiffrin's career so far American skier Mikaela Shiffrin is arguably the most dominant athlete in sport right now. The 24-year-old has taken skiing by storm, winning 17 World Cup races across four of the six disciplines last season to take her overall tally to 60 victories. Here's a look back at her short but sweet career so far. Hide Caption 1 of 17 Photos: Shiffrin's career so far 2011 – Shiffrin grew up skiing from an early age thanks to parents who were both competitive college skiers.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads in the Democrat primary among LGBT voters, a YouGov and Out magazine poll revealed.

YouGov and Out magazine collaborated to examine the Democrat primary preferences of LGBT voters, surveying 816 likely voters November 11-18. Respondents overwhelmingly chose Warren as their candidate of choice. She bested Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who came in second place, by double digits.

The Massachusetts senator garnered 31 percent support, followed by Sanders with 18 percent support, former Vice President Joe Biden (D) with 16 percent support, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with 14 percent support. Buttigieg’s fourth-place status is significant, as he is the only self-proclaimed member of the LGBT community in the race.

The remainder of the candidates saw single-digit support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) garnered six percent support, followed by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent support. Andrew Yang (D), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro (D) saw two percent support. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less.

YouGov Blue Vice President Alissa Stollwerk told Out:

Seventy-seven percent of LGBTQ+ Democratic primary voters identified in our survey as very or somewhat liberal, approximately 20 percentage points higher than the percentage of Democratic primary voters overall who identify as very or somewhat liberal in our surveys.

Out attributes Warren’s popularity among the LGBT community to her prioritization of LGBT issues – something she has incorporated into the bulk of her plans. For instance, she emphasized LGBT protections as part of her criminal justice reform plan and has called for “high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care.” She also floated mixed prisons as part of her “LGBTQ+ Rights and Equality” plan.

Stollwerk continued:

Any survey is a snapshot of a group of people at a given time. However, as far as we know, this is the first survey of likely Democratic primary voters who identify as LGBTQ+, and it hopefully will help people understand the viewpoints of these Democratic voters, what issues are important to them, and what they want to see in the next Democratic nominee for president.

More per Out:

The results themselves show the relationship between Warren and LGBTQ+ voters likely goes deeper than partisanship. She had the highest favorable ratings among candidates by a 10-point margin, with 54 percent viewing her highly favorably. Meanwhile, survey respondents also felt she had the best chance to beat President Donald Trump in a general election: 53 percent felt she could do so, followed by Biden (52 percent), Sanders (46 percent), and Buttigieg (29 percent). But if the survey is good news for the Warren campaign, the results should be a cause for concern in the Biden camp. His unfavorables among LGBTQ+ voters were disproportionately high: 33 percent of respondents viewed him highly or somewhat unfavorably, a greater percentage than every other candidate except for Gabbard and Williamson. They both netted 38 percent unfavorable ratings.

Warren has been very vocal in her support for the LGBT community on the campaign trail, even thanking drag queen Shea Couleé for “representing” Team Warren at RuPaul’s DragCon in September."

Recent polls have indicated Sanders’ health scare did not have a negative impact on his standing in the Democrat field. In fact, he has experienced a notable boost since undergoing the emergency heart procedure, both nationally and in key early primary and caucus states.

The Emerson poll, taken November 22-26, 2019, among 549 Democrat primary voters in New Hampshire, showed Sanders taking the lead with 26 percent support. It also indicated Buttigieg on the rise, coming in second place with 22 percent support.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) fell eight points behind the South Bend mayor with 14 percent support each.

According to the survey, Buttigieg fares best among independent voters, earning 29 support. Sanders, Warren, and Biden follow with 21 percent, 12 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

The poll also revealed a major shakeup in the lower tier of candidates, with Rep. Tusi Gabbard (D-HI) and Andrew Yang overtaking Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth and sixth place. They received six percent support, five percent support, and four percent support, respectively. Tom Steyer (D) came in eighth place with three percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:

Emerson notes the results reflect a “major shift” from the New Hampshire poll taken in September, “where Biden led with 24% (-10), followed by Warren with 21% (-7).

“Sanders has jumped from third, where he was at 13% (+13), and Buttigieg also doubled his support from 11% (+11),” Emerson noted.

Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said:

The Democratic voters have taken a look at Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren and they appear unsatisfied at this time which brought some voters back to Bernie Sanders while others are now moving to a fresh face in Pete Buttigieg, this demonstrates the fluidity of the race.

The results coincide with a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released this week, which also showed Sanders retaking the lead in the Granite State. The survey also indicated a surge for Buttigieg, battling Warren for second place 13 percent to her 14 percent. Biden came closely behind with 12 percent support:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for second place with 16 percent support. Warren fell two points behind with 14 percent, followed by Sanders with 13 percent support.

The rest of the field is separated by a steep dropoff. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen.

“Biden is back on top of the pack but now there is a 3-way race for second,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.

“Buttigieg has broken into the top tier, apparently at the expense of Warren, who has taken a dive after being hammered for being too far left on health care and other issues,” he added.

According to the survey, 35 percent of voters say a candidate’s ability to win in a general election matchup is the most important factor a potential nominee can possess. On that front, Biden leads, with 46 percent of Democrat and Democrat-leaning independent voters viewing him as the best bet to defeat President Trump.

The survey also found that Medicare for All, a proposal touted by both Sanders and Warren, is growing “increasingly unpopular among all American voters,” which could explain Buttigieg’s ability to catch up to them in the polls.

According to Quinnipiac, “36 percent say it is a good idea and 52 percent say it is a bad idea.”"

Two of the candidates seem to be the ones whose campaign promises imply Obama didn’t do enough to advance progressivism while in office — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT):

Publicly, he has been clear that he won’t intervene in the primary for or against a candidate, unless he believed there was some egregious attack. “I can’t even imagine with this field how bad it would have to be for him to say something,” said a close adviser. Instead, he sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear. There is one potential exception: Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him. (Asked about that, a spokesperson for Obama pointed out that Obama recently said he would support and campaign for whoever the Democratic nominee is.) If Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don’t think that’s likely. It’s not happening.” (Another close Obama friend said, “Bernie’s not a Democrat.”) As for Warren, the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama, Obama’s relationship with Warren is famously complicated. Back in early 2015, when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives, Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him—a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate. There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren’s campaign.

As for the other candidates, little support can be found from the former president.

“Obama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” one of Obama’s “closest advisers” said in the article.

“They discussed doubts about Kamala Harris’ appeal to African Americans,” the article said.

As for Steve Bullock, Obama spoke for himself: “Nobody knows who you are,” he said.

Obama adviser David Axelrod said, “I mean is Michael Bloomberg really the default candidate for non-college educated white voters?”

“Maybe Amy [Klobuchar], but I honestly don’t think she’s getting out of Iowa,” Axelrod said.

The article tries to paint Obama as a moderate compared to this field of candidates, including Warren and Sanders and their Medicare for All schemes. He is more favorable of former Vice President Joe Biden’s and Buttigieg’s healthcare plans.

But that’s not to say Obama is ready to buy any bumper stickers.

“Another adviser added, ‘I don’t think he was trying to benefit Biden here. Buttigieg benefits from this too. Knowing Obama as well as I do, he doesn’t want to help anyone or hurt anyone, he just wants to win the 2020 election,’” the article said.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is only mentioned once in the article as one of the candidates who has sought advice from Obama.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 14 percent, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D) closely behind with 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

While six points separate the remainder of the candidates from the top tier, Gabbard finds herself in fifth place with six percent support – two points ahead of Andrew Yang and three points ahead of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). They garnered four percent and three percent, respectively.

The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.4 percent, signaling a statistical tie among the top tier candidates. What is more, 21 percent of respondents indicated that they are “undecided,” and only 43 percent indicated that their “minds were made up”:

According to the Boston Globe, “support for Sanders and Warren was essentially unchanged from the last Suffolk/Globe poll in August,” but Biden “lost 9 percentage points, while Buttigieg gained 7 points.”

The poll reflects the increased skepticism of Biden’s viability among Democrat voters.

“I had pretty high hopes for Joe Biden. I wanted to like him and vote for him because of his time with the Obama administration and I thought he had the experience,” one voter, Michael Mahany, 61, told the Boston Globe.

“But he just hasn’t had his stuff together, and he just hasn’t stepped up in the debates and I am not sure he ever will now,” he added.

The poll also found that Gabbard is appealing to moderate voters in the Granite State:

The survey found Gabbard does better among men and moderates. And far more than any other candidate, her supporters said that if Gabbard doesn’t become the nominee, they will consider voting for Trump or for a third-party candidate: “I liked Tulsi more after Clinton attacked her,” said Mark Gold, a 58-year-old computer consultant who lives in Concord. “The Democratic Party appears to like to manipulate things for their preferred candidate and I think that demonstrated she is different.”

“The narrative is changing in New Hampshire,” Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said, noting the ongoing battle between the New England senators.

“Now, add to that the war between Buttigieg and Biden,” he added."

The poll of 1,000 likely voters – 33 percent Republicans, 37 percent Democrats, and 30 percent independents – revealed that when asked which is better “a free-market economic system or socialism,” 69 percent said a free market system, 12 percent picked socialism, and 18 said they were not sure.

Of the Republicans polled, 87 percent said free-market capitalism was better, and 69 percent of independents agreed. But the poll also found that 53 percent of Democrats said a free-market system was preferable to socialism.

The Heartland Institute reported on the poll:

Only 26 percent of voters said they’d vote for a presidential candidate who identifies as a socialist while 50 percent said they would not. Among voters between the ages of 18 and 39, however, 42 percent said they would vote for a socialist president. The poll found that two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for president, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – who have both embraced socialist policies – had unfavorable ratings of 49 percent and 48 percent, respectively. The poll also showed lukewarm support for gun control. Asked if they support “legislation that would ban private ownership of ‘assault-style’ rifles,” 49 percent said yes, 43 percent said no, and 8 percent were not sure. A full two-thirds did not support a repeal of the Second Amendment, which guarantees Americans the right to bear arms.

The poll was conducted on November 13 and 14, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points and a 95 percent level of confidence.

“To start a four-year job, or maybe an eight-year job, at age 79 may not be the smartest thing to do. But if I think if I thought I could win, I would have,” the 77-year-old billionaire and former New York City mayor explained at the Bermuda Executive Forum in New York City.

“I just couldn’t see a path to where I could get the nomination,” he added. “It’s just not going to happen on a national level for somebody like me starting where I am unless I was willing to change all my views and go on what CNN called ‘an apology tour.’”

Bloomberg then cited Biden as an example of a candidate who was forced to apologize for his past positions, saying with a pang of sarcasm: “[He] went out and apologized for being male, over 50, white.”

“He apologized for the one piece of legislation which is actually a pretty good anti-crime bill, which, if the liberals ever read it, most of the things they like would be in that bill. They should have loved that. But they didn’t even bother to read it. You’re anti-crime, you must be anti-populist,” he added.

Ahead of formally launching his White House bid, Bloomberg apologized for his support of “stop-and-frisk,” stating he was “sorry” that the police strategy frequently led to detention of blacks and Latinos. “I can’t change history,” he told a black church in Brooklyn. “However, today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong.”

On Sunday, Bloomberg officially became a candidate for president, just two months before the Democrats’ first primary and caucus contests will take place.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he said in his announcement.

Bloomberg’s entry into the crowded Democrat field comes as voters are concerned about whether former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to get through the primary and beat President Trump in the general election. His entry was also prompted by anxiety about whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) could defeat the incumbent president amid strong economic growth."

Sam Nunberg spoke with host Matthew Boyle on the latest edition of Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125.

He said that the portion of the partisan impeachment inquiry in the House, launched in late September and led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, had been a disaster for Democrats.

“I think the president is going to be impeached [in the House],” the former campaign aide explicitly said. Nunberg, however, is optimistic about what happens next.

“First, this may actually be better for Trump, and I’m not rationalizing this, because it wasn’t as if they’re going to pass anything during this stunt. He’s [Trump] going to have a trial, and he’s essentially going to conduct a political-type campaign and have perfect foils [during the process],” he said.

“Not only are they going to call Joe Biden and Hunter Biden to the Senate. You can call Barack Obama frankly, and you can question Barack Obama [about] what he knew [and] when he knew it; Hillary Clinton [about] what she knew [and] when she knew it about Ukraine interference on behalf of Hillary Clinton, and that’s a fact from 2016,” he continued.

Democrats and their media allies repeatedly argue that the potential U.S. presidential interference by Ukraine to benefit Clinton is a debunked conspirac, while Republicans argue otherwise.

“So [Democrats] better be careful what they wish for. Further, why this is good for the president is, well, nothing is going to be passed [in Congress] during this term,” Nunberg pointed out. “Not only is nothing going be passed, [but] you’re also going to have hypermedia coverage, and you should for the Democrat primary. So, think about that.”

“So, think about where the president is going to be actually at an advantage, because while I still think normally it would not be a net plus to be impeached under the circumstances of the president not having a foil to nothing rallies maybe putting up some ads on national TV, which will just get drained out from the Democrats buying ads, he’s going to have the attention center on him and the Democrats don’t have a real case,” he added.

“So this is actually going to end up working for the Donald as things typically do by chance,” he observed.

The president’s fortunes will change once the impeachment process moves to the Senate, Nunberg stressed.

“This [House impeachment portion] was supposed to be the best time for the Democrats when Adam Schiff did these last two weeks [of closed-door and public hearings], and we know for a fact that the weeks didn’t work … because he essentially conducted a grand jury in public where he was getting people to testify who had already testified,” the former political advisor to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign said.

“He didn’t need them for his [impeachment] report. The president could not defend himself [during what some Republicans referred to as Schiff’s Kangaroo court],” Nunberg added. “As we get to the [House] Judiciary Committee, there’s going to be some semblance of the president allowing to have a lawyer like Bill Clinton did. Perhaps, he’ll be allowed to call in some witnesses there.”

The Schiff-led House intelligence panel is expected to release its report after Thanksgiving, after which House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) is projected to promptly draft and debate articles of impeachment against Trump.

Democrats are shooting for a final full House impeachment vote by Christmas, which would set the stage for a likely Senate trial in Januar, where lawmakers are expected to acquit the U.S President, barring some unlikely and unforeseen circumstances. Once the process reaches the Senate, it will benefit Trump given the impeachment’s proximity to the November 20 presidential elections.

Ironically, the Democrats began the impeachment inquiry to allegedly prevent Trump from interfering in the upcoming elections, but it seems the process may end up helping the U.S. president, or so argues Nunberg.

Under current rules, the trial in the Senate could take weeks, moving it closer to presidential election day.

Many of the Senators running against Trump will also have to abandon the campaign trail to participate in the impeachment probe.

The Hill noted:

Both parties have a political incentive for an expeditious trial that could arrive as soon as January: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to quickly acquit Trump so Republicans can shift to other priorities like confirming judges; Democrats don’t want their 2020 presidential hopefuls, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), to get stuck in a lengthy, inside-the-Beltway impeachment trial. One possible complication to the emerging timeline is the fact that lawmakers also need to figure out how to avoid another government shutdown amid the partisan acrimony.

Although the House Democrats have not committed themselves to a specific timeline, they are expected to vote on impeachment articles by the end of the year.

Trump’s allies so far have remained united behind the president, while some cracks appear to emerge among tDemocrats."

No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate . A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.

The findings suggest slight declines in support for Biden and Warren since October, and a modest increase in backing for Buttigieg. Sanders' support remains about the same as it was in October.

A majority of potential Democratic voters remain uncertain about their choices. Just 42% say they have definitely decided on their candidates, about the same as in October, and Biden continues to have an edge among that group of committed voters.

Asked who they would choose if the race came down to the top four instead of the 18 major candidates currently in the running, the order at the top remains the same. Biden continues to hold a lead -- 35% say they would choose him -- with 23% choosing Sanders, 20% Warren and 17% Buttigieg.

Buttigieg's bump in the poll coincides with a well-received debate performance , with 22% who watched or followed news coverage about last week's debate saying he had the best night. Biden lands in second at 16%, Sanders at 10%, Harris and Warren each at 8% and Booker at 5%.

Most potential Democratic voters say they prefer a candidate who aims for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if they wouldn't make major changes, over a candidate who aims for policies that would make larger changes (56% feel that way, 36% prefer a candidate who shoots for major change). But when asked which candidate would best handle specific issues, potential Democratic voters are more closely divided between those seeking big changes and those aiming for more incremental progress.

On health care, 28% say Sanders -- an advocate of ""Medicare for All"" and the elimination of private health insurance -- would best handle the issue. That's about even with the 26% who choose Biden, who has argued against moving to a completely government-run system. Another 19% say they prefer Warren's approach, which ultimately results in government health coverage for all, while 7% choose Buttigieg, and no other candidate has the backing of more than 3% on the issue.

Sanders leads the way more clearly on handling the climate crisis: 27% favor his approach, followed by 21% who prefer Biden and 15% Warren.

Biden holds an edge on the economy, though by a narrower margin than he did in October. About 3 in 10 (29%) prefer him on the issue, down from 38% last month, with Warren at 19% and Sanders at 17%. Buttigieg lands at 7% and Yang at 5% on the issue.

Biden has lost some ground as most trusted on almost all the issues tested, while Buttigieg has made gains nearly across the board.

More potential Democratic voters see Biden as capable of managing the government effectively (86%) than say the same about Sanders (73%), Warren (73%) or Buttigieg (54%). Biden also tops the leading candidates on being able to unite the country rather than divide it (73% say so, vs. 65% for Sanders, 58% for Warren and 54% for Buttigieg).

Sanders (66%), Biden (64%) and Warren (61%) are all closely clustered on being able to bring needed change, with Buttigieg a bit behind at 54%.

Warren holds a clear advantage on having the stamina and sharpness to be president -- 81% say that describes her, compared with 66% for Buttigieg, 65% for Biden and 58% for Sanders.

Sanders' strength is being seen as honest and trustworthy. Nearly 9 in 10 potential Democratic voters (89%) call Sanders honest and trustworthy, vs. 78% for Warren, 75% for Biden and 64% for Buttigieg. That carries through among all adults as well. Overall, 62% see Sanders as honest and trustworthy, making him the only candidate of the top four Democrats plus President Donald Trump who is seen that way by a majority of Americans.

All four tested Democratic candidates outpace Trump on two measures: honesty (62% Sanders, 49% Warren, 47% Biden, 45% Buttigieg, 36% Trump) and uniting the country rather than dividing it (47% Biden, 44% Sanders, 37% Warren, 35% Buttigieg, 31% Trump).

Trump ties Sanders at the top on being able to bring needed change (43% each, followed by Biden at 40%, Warren at 39%, Buttigieg at 35%). Biden leads the field on managing the government effectively (55% Biden, 46% Sanders, 44% Warren, 42% Trump, 36% Buttigieg). While Warren takes the lead on having the stamina and sharpness for the presidency (54% describe Warren that way, 47% Trump, 46% Buttigieg, 44% Biden and 40% Sanders).

One caveat on these figures: A large number (roughly a quarter across attributes) say they are unsure how to answer about Buttigieg. For the other candidates, that number was in the single digits across the board.

Health care (46% extremely important) and gun policy (44% extremely important) continue to rank at the top of voters' issue concerns for 2020. The impeachment inquiry into Trump ranks near the bottom, with 27% calling that extremely important. That rises a bit to 39% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, but dips to just 15% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters."

""Everyone without health insurance is guaranteed to get it, and everyone who likes theirs can go ahead and keep it,"" the ad says -- an indirect if obvious attack on ""Medicare for All,"" the single-payer health care plan, and political flashpoint, that would ultimately eliminate private insurers.

Bloomberg is a longshot to win or meaningfully compete for the Democratic nomination, but his decision to run immediately blew open the party's battle over the influence of money, and the wealthiest Americans, on the political system. For Sanders and Warren, Bloomberg's campaign brings with it both an opportunity to sharpen their messages and an existential new threat: a billionaire prepared to reach deep into his near bottomless pockets in an effort to derail them, their agenda and a style of politics that more deeply engages the electorate.

The progressive senators, who have forsworn big dollar contributions, condemned Bloomberg out of the gate, with Sanders last week calling the billionaire businessman's initial outlay an attempt to ""circumvent the political process."" Absent grassroots support, Sanders said, candidates like Bloomberg had ""no business running for president."" Bloomberg has said he won't take any donations, a step to signal his independence, but one that his rivals argue effectively cuts him off from accountability to voters.

A few days later, Warren took the unusual-for-her step of calling out Bloomberg by name in Iowa.

""I am here on Day 2 of Michael Bloomberg's $37 million ad buy,"" Warren said to laughter in Ankeny on Monday. ""Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020 -- he doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money.""

Contrasting her grassroots-style campaign with Bloomberg's plans to bombard the airwaves, Warren laid out the progressive movement's view of the fight at hand.

The question, she said, is ""which vision of our democracy, which version of our democracy, is going to win. And if Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes and it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward.""

Warren's team took her remarks and cut them into an online video , which it tweeted out a few hours later. Online, at the campaign store, her ""Billionaire Tears"" mug is still for sale.

Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Sanders kept up his own attacks on Bloomberg.

""I understand the power of the '1%,'"" he said at a rally in New Hampshire. ""You're seeing that right now literally with Mayor Bloomberg, who has decided to use part of his 55 billion dollars not to buy a yacht, not to buy another home, not to buy a fancy car, but to buy the United States government.""

The Democratic Party has, over decades, become more and more welcoming, and in many cases dependent, on contributions from big business interests and wealthy donors. Even amid a progressive resurgence that has made it less politically palatable for Democrats to accept money from corporate PACs or lobbyists, billionaires like Bloomberg -- who has given prodigiously to an assortment of liberal causes, most notably in forming his gun control organization -- have largely avoided the scorn directed at conservative benefactors like the Koch Brothers.

Tom Steyer, the other billionaire vying for the nomination, effectively bought his way onto the debate stage by paying for ads soliciting donations. But his smaller fortune -- in the most relative terms -- and lower national profile has made him a less appealing foil for progressive activists, who in many cases have come to see him as a reliable ally.

Bloomberg does not have the same kind of cred. His no-donor pledge, which follows a blueprint similar to the one he followed during his time as mayor, has only stoked anger on the left.

""I will be the only candidate in this race who isn't corruptible, who isn't going to take a penny from anyone, and will work for a dollar a year,"" he said in Phoenix on Tuesday, after filing for Arizona's state primary. But for progressives critics, including Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, that misses the point.

Bloomberg ""says, 'Oh, I'm not going to take a salary because I can't be bought,"" Shakir said during a livestreamed briefing for supporters later on Tuesday. ""Well, that's just because you're not accountable to the American people.""

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in her famous 2018 viral ad said her primary against one of the party's most formidable fundraisers was ""about people versus money: we've got people, they've got money,"" put Bloomberg at the center of a recent fundraising appeal for Sanders.

""Bloomberg is launching his presidential bid. His plan? Dump piles of cash on the media. Typical billionaire move,"" she wrote, the email's subject line filled only with an eye-roll emoji, before offering a sense of just how much Bloomberg was spending. ""Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders would need 1.7 million of us to donate his average contribution -- $18 -- to match one week of Bloomberg's TV buy.""

Sanders and Warren have both rooted their campaigns in an argument that, as Warren puts it, ""the wealthy and well-connected"" hold an outsize and insidiously damaging grip on elections and the actions -- or inaction -- of government.

In a February speech inaugurating her presidential bid, Warren laid blame for the historic levels of economic inequality at the feet of the ""richest and most powerful people in America."" She also predicted, with history as her guide, how the pushback to her message would sound.

""When I talk about this stuff, someone screams 'class warfare,'"" Warren said. ""Well let me tell you something. These same rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard-working people for decades. I say it's time to fight back.""

Sanders, who has been campaigning against ""the billionaire class"" for decades, made the point bluntly in an August tweet.

""If there is going to be class warfare in this country,"" Sanders wrote , ""it's about time the working class won that war.""

Micah Uetricht, an editor at Jacobin, the socialist magazine, grabbed and reproduced the tweet in sticker form, selling 500 within 24 hours and donating the proceeds -- after printing up another thousand -- to the campaign. A few months later, this past Sunday, the Sanders team in a fundraising email offered up a similar deal to a much wider audience.

""Contribute any amount,"" they wrote to supporters, ""and get our 'Class Warfare' sticker."""

In poll after poll (including this one), they list beating Trump as a bigger priority for their primary than a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.

Figuring out which Democrat is the most electable is no easy task, however.

One thought I had was to see what quality is best correlated with Trump’s approval rating and then see which Democrats scored best on it. The problem is that there are two variables (being able to bring about change the country needs and can manage government effectively) that are highly correlated, and they give us very different answers on potential electability.

Biden is the only Democrat who a majority of voters (55%) say can manage the government effectively. All the other Democrats have a similar net score (those who say they can minus those who say they can't) to one another.

Yet, Biden has the worst spread on being a change agent (40% say yes compared to 55% who say no). Buttigieg and Sanders have the best net scores at -6 points and -7 points, respectively.

This, of course, is the fundamental issue Democratic primary voters face in 2020. If this is a change election, then Biden is likely not going to be the most electable candidate. If, however, voters end up wanting someone they think can right the ship from an unorthodox Trump presidency, Biden’s the right guy."

View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Ever since former President George H.W. Bush coined the phrase to criticize then-candidate President Ronald Reagan's tax policies, Democrats and progressives have been accusing Republicans of ""voodoo economics."" They are right to do so. The oft-repeated mantra that tax cuts for the rich will trickle down to help all of us, most recently heard in the Trump White House's claim that his trillion dollar tax cut for corporations would give each worker a $4,000 raise, keeps coming up empty.

""Supply-side economics"" seems to work only for those with a ready supply of wealth. Forty years of voodoo have left America with skyrocketing debts that cripple present and future policy, while workers keep paying more and more taxes. Americans deserve more honesty and responsibility when politicians talk about the people's pocketbooks.

Which is where the wealth tax and other proposals coming from the Democrats' left wing, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, come in. It isn't that wealth inequality isn't a massive and growing problem in America. It is, perhaps at the root of all our problems. And it is not that a wealth tax is not a serious proposal to address this serious problem. It is.

It is rather that it is wrong -- voodoo wrong -- to assert that a wealth tax would bring in massive amounts of revenue, any time soon, to meet the spending demands of the progressive platforms. The plan, or dream, comes down to this: Tax other people -- rich people -- a few cents on every dollar they own and voila, we will suddenly have enough revenue to pay for lots of goodies, like student loan forgiveness, Medicare for all college tuition, and a higher minimum wage.

Sen. Sanders claims his wealth tax will raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over 10 years, about three times the price tag of the Trump 2017 tax cuts . Sen. Warren's plan, in which she recently doubled the tax rate for billionaires from 3% to 6% (showing how easy it is to practice progressive voodoo economics) to help pay for her Medicare plan, would raise less, but still more than $3 trillion.

These projections are progressive voodoo economics.

Whatever the merits of a wealth tax -- and there are many -- there are political, legal and practical obstacles to overcome before we will see anywhere near the funds that Warren and Sanders tout, if we ever do.

Politically, the plan would have to clear both the House and the Senate, and to do so free of added-on exemptions and tax breaks that typically undermine such ambitious tax plans. The politics might even mean getting 60 votes in the Senate. Good luck with that.

Legally, there will be serious constitutional challenges to any new wealth tax. Given the way courts work, such a challenge would take years. Given the makeup of the current Supreme Court, such a challenge is unlikely to go fully in the progressives' favor.

Practically, for any wealth tax to work, it would have to be designed and implemented in a way that prevents the wealthy and their paid advisers' best efforts -- through trusts and other tricks -- to avoid paying it.

Winning this battle is something that has never been done in the history of taxation, including with the wealth transfer (or ""death tax"") tax system in the US. France, home to the economists behind the Sanders/Warren plan, recently abandoned its own wealth tax , in part because it was raising very little revenue.

Finally, there is this: If a wealth tax were to pass congressional muster, and judicial review, and administrative implementation, and actually work the way that Senators Warren and Sanders hope it does, it will .... stop working after a bit.

This is because the wealth tax has two goals that conflict. One is to break up billionaires. The other is to raise revenue. But if the first works, the second dries up, because there will be no more annual taxes to collect from the billionaires we have abolished. All the programs funded with the initial rush of cash will be left unfunded. Massive deficits -- the price, today, of Republican voodoo economics -- will haunt our present and future.

Without resorting to witchcraft, there are plenty of tax policy steps that Democrats could take to get us to a better place. We could cut the payroll tax, as former President Barack Obama did from 2010-2012. A 2% payroll tax cut would mean $1,000 a year to a worker earning $50,000, and $4,000 a year to a married couple earning $200,000 (soon thereafter, the benefit would plateau, as the payroll tax only applies to wages up to $132,900 per person ).

This is real money, not voodoo incantations.

How could we pay for this? We could restore some of the corporate tax revenues, now at their lowest level as a percent of GDP since 1936 as a result of the Trump cuts. We could also close up loopholes in the income tax, such as the ""Angel of Death"" provision that allows capital gains to magically disappear on the wealthy's deathbeds.

And there is more for creative and willing minds to explore including, one day, a real wealth tax."

Tom Iannelli pulled out an 11-by-7-inch sheet of paper covered in questions crowdsourced from his online international tech community for the 2020 presidential candidate . Harris, after all, was on the couple's short list.

""Tom's got questions from 100 people in his group,"" Linda Iannelli joked as Harris glanced down.

""Oh, good lord!"" the senator quipped, followed by her signature booming laugh. Linda Iannelli interjected then, asking the California Democrat what she would do as president to make it easier for felons to find jobs.

""I know the work,"" Harris said confidently. ""I've actually done it.""

This was the beginning of just one of five face-to-face conversations on gun violence, foreign policy and the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings that the senator had over the course of an hour this past weekend. She spoke with 13 Iowans, eight of them undecided but interested in Harris and open to being convinced to give her their support.

Harris has hosted eight of these gatherings, known as ""potential supporter clutches"" since October. Featuring about 10 likely caucusgoers identified by campaign organizers, the small events are designed to make the senator make the hard ask of voters.

""Will you commit to caucus in Kamala's corner?"" a campaign aide says she might ask directly.

Faced with any ounce of resistance, the aide says Harris follows up with a question that has come to define this stage of her campaign: ""What's holding you back?""

In the latest CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll released this month, Harris' support registered at 3%, down from 6% in a September CNN poll and 11% percent in an August Monmouth University poll. It came almost two months after Harris announced a shift to an ""all in"" on Iowa strategy, and less than a month after the campaign went through a massive restructuring that included layoffs and office closures in all early primary states except South Carolina and Iowa to cut costs.

Harris' once promising presidential bid has deteriorated from low polling numbers and the need for cash. While she shot up in the polls after squaring off with former Vice President Joe Biden during the first Democratic debate over the summer, she has since become the only candidate to gain and then lose their top tier status.

Her persuasion meetings are part of the work Harris and her campaign are doing to change the trajectory of her campaign in Iowa, a state where caucusgoers will gladly joke that they have to meet a candidate two to three times before they can decide. Her campaign has said that a top-three finish in Iowa is necessary for Harris to remain competitive in other early primary states like Nevada and South Carolina.

The power of these meetings can't be understated, said Miryam Lipper, Harris' Iowa communications director.

Harris' field organizers tell Lipper after the meetings, "" 'This makes a huge difference; this helps us lock people in who are on the fence.' ""

""Kamala Harris is good at this stuff, when she looks people in the eye and makes them feel heard,"" Lipper added.

But with fewer than 70 days until the Iowa caucuses, the question remains whether these efforts -- when she's only meeting with a handful of people at a time -- will be enough.

One-on-one

In the meetings over the weekend, Harris' tone ranged from serious and passionate about her signature policy proposals and diagnoses of what went wrong with the country to silly and lighthearted.

Douglas Dawson, upon meeting Harris, declared, ""I'm a sleep doctor and you need more of it.""

He boasted that he had supported then-Sen. Barack Obama in his 2008 bid over then-Sen. Hillary Clinton: ""I was against Hillary and supporting Barack.""

Harris whispered, ""I was, too,"" with a mischievous smile, clutching Dawson's arm. Dawson later signed a commit-to-caucus card and agreed to be a precinct leader.

To a pair of teenage sisters, Harris took a motherly or ""auntie"" tone when she discouraged them from sending intimate photos of themselves to potential partners while discussing her efforts against cyber exploitation.

""We can have a whole conversation about that dating relationship, you know, 99.9% will not end up in marriage,"" Harris said with a loud laugh. ""So just know that before you press send.""

And at times, Harris became candid about the state of her race. When a supporter said he would also chip in financially, she thanked him profusely.

""Gotta raise that money just to get on TV. It's a whole situation,"" she said.

The California Democrat became animated when describing to the Iannellis the criminal justice work she did in California to help re-enter the formerly incarcerated back to society, she then pitched her latest criminal justice reform proposal that in part would provide grants at the local level to fund similar programs.

""So you have justice issues as well, I recognize it,"" Linda Iannelli, a 72-year-old former social worker, said softly.

Once the conversation came to a close and the couple posed for their photo, Harris moved to the next table and was instantly replaced with a field organizer who made the hard ask: ""Will you sign a commit to caucus card?""

But only Tom Iannelli, 53, agreed.

When the young organizer asked Linda Iannelli what's holding her back, she simply said, ""I'm still processing, and I take my time.""

""It took us two months to pick out a camera for our wedding gift"" some 28 years ago, she told CNN in an interview after the meeting. ""It's like, the decision doesn't happen like this,"" snapping her fingers. ""It's a consideration over time.""

Iannelli said Harris was ""extremely personable.""

""I have an immediate connection with her because I did work in preschool and have done social work all my life, so I have justice issues just like she does."" But nothing Harris could say in that moment could have made her commit.

""I'm not a jumper. I'm the oldest of 10 kids,"" Iannelli said. ""I'm probably looking to see a little bit more about the field before I make a commitment.""

The outsized Democratic primary, now sitting at 18 candidates, has made it difficult for some voters to whittle down their decisions. Voters have signaled they want the field to shrink, and only 16% of voters from a Monmouth University Poll released earlier this month said they wanted additions to the field. Since that poll was taken, two other people -- former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick -- have announced their candidacies.

But the Iannellis actively want a woman in the White House and regularly donate to women candidates (""No more old men,"" Linda Iannelli said). Before signing the caucus card, Tom Iannelli was between Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

""I like the way Ms. Harris thinks,"" Iannelli said. In that moment, he also agreed to be a precinct captain at caucus night. Captains help the campaign identify possible supporters and volunteers before the caucuses. On the night of, they corral their candidate's supporters and convert other caucusgoers from nonviable candidates.

""It's not so much about the details of the plans,"" Iannelli said. ""She's been able to make those broader sweeping connections.""

Connie Capper, 53, signed a commit-to-caucus card moments before Harris walked into the room. Capper, who hosts a volunteer of the campaign at her home, decided Harris was the candidate for her during the senator's speech an hour earlier at the meet-and-greet held a block away from the hotel.

""When I was listening to her speak, I was pretty impressed with the fact that she did not promise anything,"" the Davenport, Iowa, teacher said. ""Unlike others who are running and making a bunch of promises that they hope to fulfill, she's like, 'This will be an attempt,' but there's no real promise to it. Just, 'I have a good record in this area.'""

But inside the square room outfitted with alternating campaign placards taped to the wall, Capper's admiration grew. The two spoke about gun violence in schools, with Harris asking Capper what instructions and trainings she's been taught to keep children safe.

""I just thought, 'Hey, she's a lot like me, she's short like me,' so it reinforced that she's very open, personal and she knows herself. I guess that would be the end result, she knows herself,"" Capper said. The teacher was between Harris, Biden and businessman Andrew Yang before committing.

Of the eight undecided voters, four agreed to sign commit-to-caucus cards and become volunteer precinct captains. Two of the four who didn't, Kelcey Brackett and Karen Cooney, are elected local officials who will remain neutral until closer to or on caucus night.

As the chair of the Muscatine County Democratic Party and an at-large member of the Muscatine City Council, Brackett said he hadn't really seen ""nearly as much"" out of her campaign in comparison to some higher-polling candidates in the county that voted for Obama twice before switching to Donald Trump.

Still, Brackett applauded the technique, saying the first candidate to do something similar in the area was former congressman Beto O'Rourke when he first announced. (O'Rourke has since dropped out of the 2020 race.)

In the small clutches, ""the individual gets to meet the candidate directly and they can turn around and utilize that meeting to push for additional support,"" Brackett told CNN in an interview.

Lipper, Harris' communications director, seconded that notion.

""You can get a lot by going to a big room. But you can get a lot more,"" she added, ""the extra hour and a half you spend in a room, without cameras, but with the people who are going to support your campaign."""

Warren’s ill-informed tweet is likely intended to help her compete for votes from very “woke” pro-migration Democrat primary voters. Those voters are also being wooed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has adopted a no-deportation, open-borders policy after a career spent opposing the investors’ use of cheap labor migration. Multi-billionaire investor Mike Bloomberg has adopted the same pro-migration stance as he enters the Democratic race.

In reality, the 200 Indians were following the path taken by hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates who are seeking white-collar jobs and citizenship in the United States, often via fake universities.

The victims of this Indian fraud are the growing number of Americans graduates who are denied good jobs in growing cities and are sidelined to low-prestige careers in regional cities.

The universities are the first step for many Indians because the last several presidents have allowed foreign students and graduates of U.S. universities to get work permits for the price of tuition fees. The work permit programs are the Occupational Practical Training program for graduates, and the Curricular Practical Training program for students.

The work permits allow the Indians to compete for the low-wage jobs offered by Indian managers at U.S. companies. Those jobs then allow the Indians to compete for coveted H-1B work permits, which allow them to apply for the hugely valuable prize of citizenship.

These jobs are varied, and range from starvation-wage jobs in Florida software sweatshops to up to $250,000 management jobs in Silicon Valley. The actual wages are difficult to track, partly because H-1B employers frequently shortchange their Indian workers and demand kickbacks. Indians are willing to pay the kickbacks because kickbacks are routine in India and because their U.S.-based Indian managers have the power to send them home or provide the hugely valuable prize of U.S. citizenship.

The growing number of legal Indian immigrants or visa workers is also attracting more illegals from India. The population of Indian illegals is now more than 600,000 people and includes a large number of visa workers who stayed after their visas expired, according to recent estimates.

Warren’s anti-deportation tweet responded to a report in the Detroit Free Press that said:

A total of about 250 students have now been arrested since January on immigration violations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of a sting operation by federal agents who enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India, to attend the school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies, according to ICE officials. … The students had arrived legally in the U.S. on student visas, but since the University of Farmington was later revealed to be a creation of federal agents, they lost their immigration status after it was shut down in January. The school was located on Northwestern Highway near 13 Mile Road in Farmington Hills and staffed with undercover agents posing as university officials. Out of the approximately 250 students arrested on administrative charges, “nearly 80% were granted voluntary departure and departed the United States,” the Detroit office of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) told the Free Press in a statement Tuesday.

In this case, the justice department is trying to jail several Indians who volunteered to recruit other Indians with promises that they could get work permits without spending any time at the University of Farmington, in Michigan. The other 2oo or so Indians who enrolled in the fake university are being deported.

OPT fraud is routine. In 2016, the Washington Post described the knowing fraud at the University of Northern New Jersey:

“In many instances, the schools are nothing more than sham visa mills,” [New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J.] Fishman noted. “They have no curriculum, no classes, no instructors, and no real students. These purported schools and their corrupt administrators simply give out I-20 [work permit] forms in exchange for payment. This illegal practice is known as ‘pay to stay’ because foreign nationals pay money to brokers and recruiters, like the defendants, to be enrolled in a school for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration status as a student — but with no intention of or interest in going to class or making any progress toward an academic degree.” Parts of conversations between defendants and UNNJ “staff” make clear how transparent the alleged fraud was. Zitong Wen and Chaun Kit Yuen, for example, are two Chinese nationals residing in California now charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit. Their indictment said they contacted UNNJ in 2014 “to offer their services as recruiting agents for purported foreign students.” But the alleged conversations were a little unusual. “You know that none of these people are going to class,” an undercover agent allegedly told Yeun. “[J]ust, you know, between us, you know, you’re good with that right? Make sure your clients are good with it too, okay? I don’t want anybody, you know, showing up at my doorstep thinking they’re gonna be in my … advanced calculus class or anything like that. … That’s not gonna happen, right? We know this is just to maintain status.”

The indictment reported Yeun laughed.

GAO warns DHS to do more to prevent the smuggling of Indian and Chinese graduates into U.S. white-collar careers, such as software, healthcare, accounting, etc. Most smuggling takes place via the universities' 'OPT' work-permit giveaway to foreign grads. https://t.co/NSUIVQDO4m — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2019

Roughly 300,000 foreign graduates are using the OPT program to take jobs. Another 750,000 foreigners are using the H-1B program to get white-collar jobs. In addition, foreign graduates also use the L-1, J-1, H4EAD, TN, and B-1 programs to take roughly 1.5 million white-collar jobs throughout the United States. The federal government also provides work permits to more than one million foreign blue-collar workers each year.

Overall, roughly 1.5 million foreign graduates hold white-collar jobs in the United States. That number is double the 800,000 Americans who will graduate in 2019 from four-year colleges with skilled degrees.

The huge number of Indian visa workers has also ensured that fraud, caste politics, and bribery are increasingly common in workplaces that were once dominated by white-collar professionals. For example, many U.S. professionals report anonymously that Indian managers only hire Indians and refuse to hire the Americans who cannot be trusted to stay quiet about kickbacks. Some of these complaints are documented by a growing number of lawsuits against Indian managers in U.S companies.

The legality of the OPT program is being challenged by a lawsuit from the Immigration Reform Law Institute. The lawsuit has prompted a huge pushback from billionaire investors, including Bloomberg, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg. The program is important to investors because their stock values rise by $25 billion whenever they can use India’s workers to push payroll costs down by another $1 billion.

The OPT program is also supported by the Indian government, which pressures legislators and U.S. investors to import more of India’s workers via the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy.

Warren has repeatedly denounced those wealthy investors, but her pro-OPT tweet leaves her allied with the very wealthy founders of a pro-OPT advocacy group, FWD.us.

Justice Dept. is defending OPT program that pays investors $2 bill p/year to hire 300K cheap foreign graduates instead of Americans.

It was created by GW Bush, Obama & lobbyists, not by Congress, says lawsuit.

Ironically, Warren’s anti-enforcement tweet was retweeted or liked by “woke” progressives whose jobs are being targeted by the white-collar migrants."

Recent polls have indicated Sanders’ health scare did not have a negative impact on his standing in the Democrat field. In fact, he has experienced a notable boost since undergoing the emergency heart procedure, both nationally and in key early primary and caucus states.

The Emerson poll, taken November 22-26, 2019, among 549 Democrat primary voters in New Hampshire, showed Sanders taking the lead with 26 percent support. It also indicated Buttigieg on the rise, coming in second place with 22 percent support.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) fell eight points behind the South Bend mayor with 14 percent support each.

According to the survey, Buttigieg fares best among independent voters, earning 29 support. Sanders, Warren, and Biden follow with 21 percent, 12 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

The poll also revealed a major shakeup in the lower tier of candidates, with Rep. Tusi Gabbard (D-HI) and Andrew Yang overtaking Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth and sixth place. They received six percent support, five percent support, and four percent support, respectively. Tom Steyer (D) came in eighth place with three percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:

Emerson notes the results reflect a “major shift” from the New Hampshire poll taken in September, “where Biden led with 24% (-10), followed by Warren with 21% (-7).

“Sanders has jumped from third, where he was at 13% (+13), and Buttigieg also doubled his support from 11% (+11),” Emerson noted.

Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said:

The Democratic voters have taken a look at Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren and they appear unsatisfied at this time which brought some voters back to Bernie Sanders while others are now moving to a fresh face in Pete Buttigieg, this demonstrates the fluidity of the race.

The results coincide with a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released this week, which also showed Sanders retaking the lead in the Granite State. The survey also indicated a surge for Buttigieg, battling Warren for second place 13 percent to her 14 percent. Biden came closely behind with 12 percent support:

“The narrative is changing in New Hampshire,” Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said of the results."

The poll of 1,000 likely voters – 33 percent Republicans, 37 percent Democrats, and 30 percent independents – revealed that when asked which is better “a free-market economic system or socialism,” 69 percent said a free market system, 12 percent picked socialism, and 18 said they were not sure.

Of the Republicans polled, 87 percent said free-market capitalism was better, and 69 percent of independents agreed. But the poll also found that 53 percent of Democrats said a free-market system was preferable to socialism.

The Heartland Institute reported on the poll:

Only 26 percent of voters said they’d vote for a presidential candidate who identifies as a socialist while 50 percent said they would not. Among voters between the ages of 18 and 39, however, 42 percent said they would vote for a socialist president. The poll found that two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for president, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – who have both embraced socialist policies – had unfavorable ratings of 49 percent and 48 percent, respectively. The poll also showed lukewarm support for gun control. Asked if they support “legislation that would ban private ownership of ‘assault-style’ rifles,” 49 percent said yes, 43 percent said no, and 8 percent were not sure. A full two-thirds did not support a repeal of the Second Amendment, which guarantees Americans the right to bear arms.

The poll was conducted on November 13 and 14, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points and a 95 percent level of confidence.

“To start a four-year job, or maybe an eight-year job, at age 79 may not be the smartest thing to do. But if I think if I thought I could win, I would have,” the 77-year-old billionaire and former New York City mayor explained at the Bermuda Executive Forum in New York City.

“I just couldn’t see a path to where I could get the nomination,” he added. “It’s just not going to happen on a national level for somebody like me starting where I am unless I was willing to change all my views and go on what CNN called ‘an apology tour.’”

Bloomberg then cited Biden as an example of a candidate who was forced to apologize for his past positions, saying with a pang of sarcasm: “[He] went out and apologized for being male, over 50, white.”

“He apologized for the one piece of legislation which is actually a pretty good anti-crime bill, which, if the liberals ever read it, most of the things they like would be in that bill. They should have loved that. But they didn’t even bother to read it. You’re anti-crime, you must be anti-populist,” he added.

Ahead of formally launching his White House bid, Bloomberg apologized for his support of “stop-and-frisk,” stating he was “sorry” that the police strategy frequently led to detention of blacks and Latinos. “I can’t change history,” he told a black church in Brooklyn. “However, today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong.”

On Sunday, Bloomberg officially became a candidate for president, just two months before the Democrats’ first primary and caucus contests will take place.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he said in his announcement.

Bloomberg’s entry into the crowded Democrat field comes as voters are concerned about whether former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to get through the primary and beat President Trump in the general election. His entry was also prompted by anxiety about whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) could defeat the incumbent president amid strong economic growth."

Sam Nunberg spoke with host Matthew Boyle on the latest edition of Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125.

He said that the portion of the partisan impeachment inquiry in the House, launched in late September and led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, had been a disaster for Democrats.

“I think the president is going to be impeached [in the House],” the former campaign aide explicitly said. Nunberg, however, is optimistic about what happens next.

“First, this may actually be better for Trump, and I’m not rationalizing this, because it wasn’t as if they’re going to pass anything during this stunt. He’s [Trump] going to have a trial, and he’s essentially going to conduct a political-type campaign and have perfect foils [during the process],” he said.

“Not only are they going to call Joe Biden and Hunter Biden to the Senate. You can call Barack Obama frankly, and you can question Barack Obama [about] what he knew [and] when he knew it; Hillary Clinton [about] what she knew [and] when she knew it about Ukraine interference on behalf of Hillary Clinton, and that’s a fact from 2016,” he continued.

Democrats and their media allies repeatedly argue that the potential U.S. presidential interference by Ukraine to benefit Clinton is a debunked conspirac, while Republicans argue otherwise.

“So [Democrats] better be careful what they wish for. Further, why this is good for the president is, well, nothing is going to be passed [in Congress] during this term,” Nunberg pointed out. “Not only is nothing going be passed, [but] you’re also going to have hypermedia coverage, and you should for the Democrat primary. So, think about that.”

“So, think about where the president is going to be actually at an advantage, because while I still think normally it would not be a net plus to be impeached under the circumstances of the president not having a foil to nothing rallies maybe putting up some ads on national TV, which will just get drained out from the Democrats buying ads, he’s going to have the attention center on him and the Democrats don’t have a real case,” he added.

“So this is actually going to end up working for the Donald as things typically do by chance,” he observed.

The president’s fortunes will change once the impeachment process moves to the Senate, Nunberg stressed.

“This [House impeachment portion] was supposed to be the best time for the Democrats when Adam Schiff did these last two weeks [of closed-door and public hearings], and we know for a fact that the weeks didn’t work … because he essentially conducted a grand jury in public where he was getting people to testify who had already testified,” the former political advisor to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign said.

“He didn’t need them for his [impeachment] report. The president could not defend himself [during what some Republicans referred to as Schiff’s Kangaroo court],” Nunberg added. “As we get to the [House] Judiciary Committee, there’s going to be some semblance of the president allowing to have a lawyer like Bill Clinton did. Perhaps, he’ll be allowed to call in some witnesses there.”

The Schiff-led House intelligence panel is expected to release its report after Thanksgiving, after which House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) is projected to promptly draft and debate articles of impeachment against Trump.

Democrats are shooting for a final full House impeachment vote by Christmas, which would set the stage for a likely Senate trial in Januar, where lawmakers are expected to acquit the U.S President, barring some unlikely and unforeseen circumstances. Once the process reaches the Senate, it will benefit Trump given the impeachment’s proximity to the November 20 presidential elections.

Ironically, the Democrats began the impeachment inquiry to allegedly prevent Trump from interfering in the upcoming elections, but it seems the process may end up helping the U.S. president, or so argues Nunberg.

Under current rules, the trial in the Senate could take weeks, moving it closer to presidential election day.

Many of the Senators running against Trump will also have to abandon the campaign trail to participate in the impeachment probe.

The Hill noted:

Both parties have a political incentive for an expeditious trial that could arrive as soon as January: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to quickly acquit Trump so Republicans can shift to other priorities like confirming judges; Democrats don’t want their 2020 presidential hopefuls, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), to get stuck in a lengthy, inside-the-Beltway impeachment trial. One possible complication to the emerging timeline is the fact that lawmakers also need to figure out how to avoid another government shutdown amid the partisan acrimony.

Although the House Democrats have not committed themselves to a specific timeline, they are expected to vote on impeachment articles by the end of the year.

Trump’s allies so far have remained united behind the president, while some cracks appear to emerge among tDemocrats."

Sensing a potential victory in Iowa, Mayor Pete Buttigieg launched an ad that goes after proposals from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to make tuition free at public colleges and universities.

""I believe we should move to make college affordable for everybody,"" Buttigieg says in the ad. ""There are some voices saying, 'Well that doesn't count unless you go even further, unless it's free even for the kids of millionaires. But I only want to make promises that we can keep.""

The mayor's critics have pounced on this line of attack. After all, some of the nation's most successful federal programs — such as Social Security, Medicare and K-12 public education — have been available to all Americans regardless of their income. Surely, he doesn't think that these programs are also misconceived?

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez weighed in with a warning on Twitter : ""This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition free public college.""

To be sure, it is more than legitimate for Democrats to attack proposals from their competitors as too bold or poorly conceived. It is healthy for Democrats to encounter tough criticism from every quarter to see who is best prepared to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.

But Democrats need to be cautious. There is a long history of Republican candidates using smears that unfairly characterize candidates or their policies against the Democratic party nominee. Very often the candidates who think of themselves as the most moderate in the bunch find themselves the target of rhetoric that they or one of their colleagues originally produced.

Democratic candidates who seek to paint themselves as the most moderate in the pack should not forget just how far the GOP is willing go to paint any of the nominees as wild-eyed socialist radicals. Democrats should not underestimate the importance of working as a party to frame the debate around key issues so that they don't end up giving bipartisan legitimacy to spurious conservative talking points.

During the height of the Cold War in the 1940s and 1950s, Democrats often went after each other by accusing others of being soft on communism. Prominent officials in the party castigated the left wing by charging that they were too radical. In doing so, they played into the strategy of equating domestic progressivism and international diplomacy with socialism. Former Vice President Henry Wallace was one of the prime victims of this kind of campaign.

Yet Democrats — from Presidents Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson — learned that they could not contain the fallout from this style of partisan warfare. Eventually, no matter how hawkish the Democrats were, Republicans went after them as being part of the party that was too weak on defense.

When former Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1972, he condemned South Dakota Sen. George McGovern for being weak on defense. Humphrey warned: ""Nor am I going to let Senator McGovern's defense proposals make America into second‐class power.""

McGovern won the nomination. President Richard Nixon put together a fierce campaign that tagged McGovern as a leftist who would endanger national security. Although McGovern had been a staunch internationalist who supported most of the Cold War strategy, Nixon was successful.

In 1984, Democrats were desperate to figure out who was the most electable Democrat to defeat President Ronald Reagan, who in their mind had brought the country into a dangerous era of conservatism, threatening global peace and the social safety net. Ohio Sen. John Glenn, who believed that he had the best chance to beat the Gipper, warned voters that Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale had supported dangerous cuts in defense spending that jeopardized key programs like the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter plane program.

JUST WATCHED Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa 03:29

After Mondale won the nomination, Reagan frequently turned to quotes from Democrats that depicted Mondale as coming from the dovish wing of the party, which he was not.

In 1988, during the Massachusetts primary, Al Gore brought up the state's weekend furlough program for prisoners. He did so to tag the state's technocratic Gov. Michael Dukakis as being far too liberal on crime, a big topic in the 1980s (though the furlough program was started by Dukakis' predecessor).

Republicans remembered what Gore had said when then-Vice President George H.W. Bush faced off against Dukakis in the general election. The GOP injected race into the story by highlighting the case of an African-American man named Willie Horton , who had escaped from the furlough program, raped a white woman and stabbed her partner. The Republican campaign effectively devastated Dukakis's image by summoning the case.

Similarly, in 2004 Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry went after Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who had been doing well in the race, speaking about his opposition to the disastrous war in Iraq. Kerry warned that Dean would be weak on defense after 9/11 and that his candidacy would ensure President George W. Bush's re-election.

Referring to Dean's statement that the US was not safer after Saddam Hussein had been captured, Kerry said: ""Someone who talks like this is going to have a hard time convincing the American people that he can keep them safe. This election is too vital for us to lose ... because voters refuse to take a gamble on national security and the steadiness of our leadership."" Although Kerry won the nomination, that became the centerpiece of GOP attacks against him.

Democrats who attack from the center don't always think through the potential impact of their words. They operate from a mythical position that they will be able to insulate themselves from the same such attacks if their turn comes in the crossfire. But we have seen from history it doesn't work that way.

The better strategy would be to shore up support for Democratic ideas and policies during the caucuses and primaries, insisting on a debate that centers on those terms rather than Republican points, and not offering the GOP more material going into the fall campaign.

For if they are not careful, the moderates might end up doing exactly what Republicans are hoping for, thereby helping to set up the conditions for President Trump's reelection.

Frank said, “I do think the most interesting statistic there is take the two candidates who have been talking about being more aimed at beating Trump and more cognizant of the political constraints that exist on very far-reaching measures that’s the Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. They together have many, many more votes than Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. That’s the way it’s focused. Then if you throw in the others like Amy Klobuchar and even Bloomberg, I think the interesting point now is that the view that says it’s important for us to beat Trump and to do that we have to avoid things that are likely to alienate people, like Medicare for all which I agree is a problem. I think that’s a sign maybe after Obama’s speech that a consensus is emerging or at least a strong majority on the Democratic side for electability, still with a very liberal program.”

He continued, “The point is not what the die-hards think, but how many there are? Look at the numbers, look at Biden and Buttigieg and throw in Klobuchar and Bloomberg.”

He added, “Elizabeth Warren is a very intelligent, very smart candidate. She tried to move off of Medicare for all. I don’t think she did it as successfully politically as she was hoping, but she understood that. There are differences between her and Sanders on this. So, yeah, I do think that a majority of those who will vote on the Democratic side — here’s the issue, usually the most ideologically motivated are more likely to vote in primaries. The anti-trump feeling is so strong among Democrats I think for very good reason that it becomes an equal turnout driver with the usual positive ‘Oh, we must make enormous changes.'”

He concluded, “Bloomberg is not pulling the party to the center. He is hoping to catch on to what was already happening. You already have a centrist majority.”

(CNN) Ever since former President George H.W. Bush coined the phrase to criticize then-candidate President Ronald Reagan's tax policies, Democrats and progressives have been accusing Republicans of ""voodoo economics."" They are right to do so. The oft-repeated mantra that tax cuts for the rich will trickle down to help all of us, most recently heard in the Trump White House's claim that his trillion dollar tax cut for corporations would give each worker a $4,000 raise, keeps coming up empty.

""Supply-side economics"" seems to work only for those with a ready supply of wealth. Forty years of voodoo have left America with skyrocketing debts that cripple present and future policy, while workers keep paying more and more taxes. Americans deserve more honesty and responsibility when politicians talk about the people's pocketbooks.

Which is where the wealth tax and other proposals coming from the Democrats' left wing, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, come in. It isn't that wealth inequality isn't a massive and growing problem in America. It is, perhaps at the root of all our problems. And it is not that a wealth tax is not a serious proposal to address this serious problem. It is.

It is rather that it is wrong -- voodoo wrong -- to assert that a wealth tax would bring in massive amounts of revenue, any time soon, to meet the spending demands of the progressive platforms. The plan, or dream, comes down to this: Tax other people -- rich people -- a few cents on every dollar they own and voila, we will suddenly have enough revenue to pay for lots of goodies, like student loan forgiveness, Medicare for all college tuition, and a higher minimum wage.

Sen. Sanders claims his wealth tax will raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over 10 years, about three times the price tag of the Trump 2017 tax cuts . Sen. Warren's plan, in which she recently doubled the tax rate for billionaires from 3% to 6% (showing how easy it is to practice progressive voodoo economics) to help pay for her Medicare plan, would raise less, but still more than $3 trillion.

These projections are progressive voodoo economics.

Whatever the merits of a wealth tax -- and there are many -- there are political, legal and practical obstacles to overcome before we will see anywhere near the funds that Warren and Sanders tout, if we ever do.

Politically, the plan would have to clear both the House and the Senate, and to do so free of added-on exemptions and tax breaks that typically undermine such ambitious tax plans. The politics might even mean getting 60 votes in the Senate. Good luck with that.

Legally, there will be serious constitutional challenges to any new wealth tax. Given the way courts work, such a challenge would take years. Given the makeup of the current Supreme Court, such a challenge is unlikely to go fully in the progressives' favor.

Practically, for any wealth tax to work, it would have to be designed and implemented in a way that prevents the wealthy and their paid advisers' best efforts -- through trusts and other tricks -- to avoid paying it.

Winning this battle is something that has never been done in the history of taxation, including with the wealth transfer (or ""death tax"") tax system in the US. France, home to the economists behind the Sanders/Warren plan, recently abandoned its own wealth tax , in part because it was raising very little revenue.

Finally, there is this: If a wealth tax were to pass congressional muster, and judicial review, and administrative implementation, and actually work the way that Senators Warren and Sanders hope it does, it will .... stop working after a bit.

This is because the wealth tax has two goals that conflict. One is to break up billionaires. The other is to raise revenue. But if the first works, the second dries up, because there will be no more annual taxes to collect from the billionaires we have abolished. All the programs funded with the initial rush of cash will be left unfunded. Massive deficits -- the price, today, of Republican voodoo economics -- will haunt our present and future.

Without resorting to witchcraft, there are plenty of tax policy steps that Democrats could take to get us to a better place. We could cut the payroll tax, as former President Barack Obama did from 2010-2012. A 2% payroll tax cut would mean $1,000 a year to a worker earning $50,000, and $4,000 a year to a married couple earning $200,000 (soon thereafter, the benefit would plateau, as the payroll tax only applies to wages up to $132,900 per person ).

This is real money, not voodoo incantations.

How could we pay for this? We could restore some of the corporate tax revenues, now at their lowest level as a percent of GDP since 1936 as a result of the Trump cuts. We could also close up loopholes in the income tax, such as the ""Angel of Death"" provision that allows capital gains to magically disappear on the wealthy's deathbeds.

Tom Iannelli pulled out an 11-by-7-inch sheet of paper covered in questions crowdsourced from his online international tech community for the 2020 presidential candidate . Harris, after all, was on the couple's short list.

""Tom's got questions from 100 people in his group,"" Linda Iannelli joked as Harris glanced down.

""Oh, good lord!"" the senator quipped, followed by her signature booming laugh. Linda Iannelli interjected then, asking the California Democrat what she would do as president to make it easier for felons to find jobs.

""I know the work,"" Harris said confidently. ""I've actually done it.""

This was the beginning of just one of five face-to-face conversations on gun violence, foreign policy and the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings that the senator had over the course of an hour this past weekend. She spoke with 13 Iowans, eight of them undecided but interested in Harris and open to being convinced to give her their support.

Harris has hosted eight of these gatherings, known as ""potential supporter clutches"" since October. Featuring about 10 likely caucusgoers identified by campaign organizers, the small events are designed to make the senator make the hard ask of voters.

""Will you commit to caucus in Kamala's corner?"" a campaign aide says she might ask directly.

Faced with any ounce of resistance, the aide says Harris follows up with a question that has come to define this stage of her campaign: ""What's holding you back?""

In the latest CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll released this month, Harris' support registered at 3%, down from 6% in a September CNN poll and 11% percent in an August Monmouth University poll. It came almost two months after Harris announced a shift to an ""all in"" on Iowa strategy, and less than a month after the campaign went through a massive restructuring that included layoffs and office closures in all early primary states except South Carolina and Iowa to cut costs.

Harris' once promising presidential bid has deteriorated from low polling numbers and the need for cash. While she shot up in the polls after squaring off with former Vice President Joe Biden during the first Democratic debate over the summer, she has since become the only candidate to gain and then lose their top tier status.

Her persuasion meetings are part of the work Harris and her campaign are doing to change the trajectory of her campaign in Iowa, a state where caucusgoers will gladly joke that they have to meet a candidate two to three times before they can decide. Her campaign has said that a top-three finish in Iowa is necessary for Harris to remain competitive in other early primary states like Nevada and South Carolina.

The power of these meetings can't be understated, said Miryam Lipper, Harris' Iowa communications director.

Harris' field organizers tell Lipper after the meetings, "" 'This makes a huge difference; this helps us lock people in who are on the fence.' ""

""Kamala Harris is good at this stuff, when she looks people in the eye and makes them feel heard,"" Lipper added.

But with fewer than 70 days until the Iowa caucuses, the question remains whether these efforts -- when she's only meeting with a handful of people at a time -- will be enough.

One-on-one

In the meetings over the weekend, Harris' tone ranged from serious and passionate about her signature policy proposals and diagnoses of what went wrong with the country to silly and lighthearted.

Douglas Dawson, upon meeting Harris, declared, ""I'm a sleep doctor and you need more of it.""

He boasted that he had supported then-Sen. Barack Obama in his 2008 bid over then-Sen. Hillary Clinton: ""I was against Hillary and supporting Barack.""

Harris whispered, ""I was, too,"" with a mischievous smile, clutching Dawson's arm. Dawson later signed a commit-to-caucus card and agreed to be a precinct leader.

To a pair of teenage sisters, Harris took a motherly or ""auntie"" tone when she discouraged them from sending intimate photos of themselves to potential partners while discussing her efforts against cyber exploitation.

""We can have a whole conversation about that dating relationship, you know, 99.9% will not end up in marriage,"" Harris said with a loud laugh. ""So just know that before you press send.""

And at times, Harris became candid about the state of her race. When a supporter said he would also chip in financially, she thanked him profusely.

""Gotta raise that money just to get on TV. It's a whole situation,"" she said.

The California Democrat became animated when describing to the Iannellis the criminal justice work she did in California to help re-enter the formerly incarcerated back to society, she then pitched her latest criminal justice reform proposal that in part would provide grants at the local level to fund similar programs.

""So you have justice issues as well, I recognize it,"" Linda Iannelli, a 72-year-old former social worker, said softly.

Once the conversation came to a close and the couple posed for their photo, Harris moved to the next table and was instantly replaced with a field organizer who made the hard ask: ""Will you sign a commit to caucus card?""

But only Tom Iannelli, 53, agreed.

When the young organizer asked Linda Iannelli what's holding her back, she simply said, ""I'm still processing, and I take my time.""

""It took us two months to pick out a camera for our wedding gift"" some 28 years ago, she told CNN in an interview after the meeting. ""It's like, the decision doesn't happen like this,"" snapping her fingers. ""It's a consideration over time.""

Iannelli said Harris was ""extremely personable.""

""I have an immediate connection with her because I did work in preschool and have done social work all my life, so I have justice issues just like she does."" But nothing Harris could say in that moment could have made her commit.

""I'm not a jumper. I'm the oldest of 10 kids,"" Iannelli said. ""I'm probably looking to see a little bit more about the field before I make a commitment.""

The outsized Democratic primary, now sitting at 18 candidates, has made it difficult for some voters to whittle down their decisions. Voters have signaled they want the field to shrink, and only 16% of voters from a Monmouth University Poll released earlier this month said they wanted additions to the field. Since that poll was taken, two other people -- former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick -- have announced their candidacies.

But the Iannellis actively want a woman in the White House and regularly donate to women candidates (""No more old men,"" Linda Iannelli said). Before signing the caucus card, Tom Iannelli was between Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

""I like the way Ms. Harris thinks,"" Iannelli said. In that moment, he also agreed to be a precinct captain at caucus night. Captains help the campaign identify possible supporters and volunteers before the caucuses. On the night of, they corral their candidate's supporters and convert other caucusgoers from nonviable candidates.

""It's not so much about the details of the plans,"" Iannelli said. ""She's been able to make those broader sweeping connections.""

Connie Capper, 53, signed a commit-to-caucus card moments before Harris walked into the room. Capper, who hosts a volunteer of the campaign at her home, decided Harris was the candidate for her during the senator's speech an hour earlier at the meet-and-greet held a block away from the hotel.

""When I was listening to her speak, I was pretty impressed with the fact that she did not promise anything,"" the Davenport, Iowa, teacher said. ""Unlike others who are running and making a bunch of promises that they hope to fulfill, she's like, 'This will be an attempt,' but there's no real promise to it. Just, 'I have a good record in this area.'""

But inside the square room outfitted with alternating campaign placards taped to the wall, Capper's admiration grew. The two spoke about gun violence in schools, with Harris asking Capper what instructions and trainings she's been taught to keep children safe.

""I just thought, 'Hey, she's a lot like me, she's short like me,' so it reinforced that she's very open, personal and she knows herself. I guess that would be the end result, she knows herself,"" Capper said. The teacher was between Harris, Biden and businessman Andrew Yang before committing.

Of the eight undecided voters, four agreed to sign commit-to-caucus cards and become volunteer precinct captains. Two of the four who didn't, Kelcey Brackett and Karen Cooney, are elected local officials who will remain neutral until closer to or on caucus night.

As the chair of the Muscatine County Democratic Party and an at-large member of the Muscatine City Council, Brackett said he hadn't really seen ""nearly as much"" out of her campaign in comparison to some higher-polling candidates in the county that voted for Obama twice before switching to Donald Trump.

Still, Brackett applauded the technique, saying the first candidate to do something similar in the area was former congressman Beto O'Rourke when he first announced. (O'Rourke has since dropped out of the 2020 race.)

In the small clutches, ""the individual gets to meet the candidate directly and they can turn around and utilize that meeting to push for additional support,"" Brackett told CNN in an interview.

Lipper, Harris' communications director, seconded that notion.

""You can get a lot by going to a big room. But you can get a lot more,"" she added, ""the extra hour and a half you spend in a room, without cameras, but with the people who are going to support your campaign."""

Warren said in a tweeted response to an article in the Detroit Free Press:

This is cruel and appalling. These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them.

Warren’s ill-informed tweet is likely intended to help her compete for votes from very “woke” pro-migration Democrat primary voters. Those voters are also being wooed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has adopted a no-deportation, open-borders policy after a career spent opposing the investors’ use of cheap labor migration. Multi-billionaire investor Mike Bloomberg has adopted the same pro-migration stance as he enters the Democratic race.

In reality, the 200 Indians were following the path taken by hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates who are seeking white-collar jobs and citizenship in the United States, often via fake universities.

The victims of this Indian fraud are the growing number of Americans graduates who are denied good jobs in growing cities and are sidelined to low-prestige careers in regional cities.

The universities are the first step for many Indians because the last several presidents have allowed foreign students and graduates of U.S. universities to get work permits for the price of tuition fees. The work permit programs are the Occupational Practical Training program for graduates, and the Curricular Practical Training program for students.

The work permits allow the Indians to compete for the low-wage jobs offered by Indian managers at U.S. companies. Those jobs then allow the Indians to compete for coveted H-1B work permits, which allow them to apply for the hugely valuable prize of citizenship.

These jobs are varied, and range from starvation-wage jobs in Florida software sweatshops to up to $250,000 management jobs in Silicon Valley. The actual wages are difficult to track, partly because H-1B employers frequently shortchange their Indian workers and demand kickbacks. Indians are willing to pay the kickbacks because kickbacks are routine in India and because their U.S.-based Indian managers have the power to send them home or provide the hugely valuable prize of U.S. citizenship.

The growing number of legal Indian immigrants or visa workers is also attracting more illegals from India. The population of Indian illegals is now more than 600,000 people and includes a large number of visa workers who stayed after their visas expired, according to recent estimates.

Warren’s anti-deportation tweet responded to a report in the Detroit Free Press that said:

A total of about 250 students have now been arrested since January on immigration violations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of a sting operation by federal agents who enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India, to attend the school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies, according to ICE officials. … The students had arrived legally in the U.S. on student visas, but since the University of Farmington was later revealed to be a creation of federal agents, they lost their immigration status after it was shut down in January. The school was located on Northwestern Highway near 13 Mile Road in Farmington Hills and staffed with undercover agents posing as university officials. Out of the approximately 250 students arrested on administrative charges, “nearly 80% were granted voluntary departure and departed the United States,” the Detroit office of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) told the Free Press in a statement Tuesday.

In this case, the justice department is trying to jail several Indians who volunteered to recruit other Indians with promises that they could get work permits without spending any time at the University of Farmington, in Michigan. The other 2oo or so Indians who enrolled in the fake university are being deported.

OPT fraud is routine. In 2016, the Washington Post described the knowing fraud at the University of Northern New Jersey:

“In many instances, the schools are nothing more than sham visa mills,” [New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J.] Fishman noted. “They have no curriculum, no classes, no instructors, and no real students. These purported schools and their corrupt administrators simply give out I-20 [work permit] forms in exchange for payment. This illegal practice is known as ‘pay to stay’ because foreign nationals pay money to brokers and recruiters, like the defendants, to be enrolled in a school for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration status as a student — but with no intention of or interest in going to class or making any progress toward an academic degree.” Parts of conversations between defendants and UNNJ “staff” make clear how transparent the alleged fraud was. Zitong Wen and Chaun Kit Yuen, for example, are two Chinese nationals residing in California now charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit. Their indictment said they contacted UNNJ in 2014 “to offer their services as recruiting agents for purported foreign students.” But the alleged conversations were a little unusual. “You know that none of these people are going to class,” an undercover agent allegedly told Yeun. “[J]ust, you know, between us, you know, you’re good with that right? Make sure your clients are good with it too, okay? I don’t want anybody, you know, showing up at my doorstep thinking they’re gonna be in my … advanced calculus class or anything like that. … That’s not gonna happen, right? We know this is just to maintain status.”

The indictment reported Yeun laughed.

GAO warns DHS to do more to prevent the smuggling of Indian and Chinese graduates into U.S. white-collar careers, such as software, healthcare, accounting, etc. Most smuggling takes place via the universities' 'OPT' work-permit giveaway to foreign grads. https://t.co/NSUIVQDO4m — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2019

Roughly 300,000 foreign graduates are using the OPT program to take jobs. Another 750,000 foreigners are using the H-1B program to get white-collar jobs. In addition, foreign graduates also use the L-1, J-1, H4EAD, TN, and B-1 programs to take roughly 1.5 million white-collar jobs throughout the United States. The federal government also provides work permits to more than one million foreign blue-collar workers each year.

Overall, roughly 1.5 million foreign graduates hold white-collar jobs in the United States. That number is double the 800,000 Americans who will graduate in 2019 from four-year colleges with skilled degrees.

The huge number of Indian visa workers has also ensured that fraud, caste politics, and bribery are increasingly common in workplaces that were once dominated by white-collar professionals. For example, many U.S. professionals report anonymously that Indian managers only hire Indians and refuse to hire the Americans who cannot be trusted to stay quiet about kickbacks. Some of these complaints are documented by a growing number of lawsuits against Indian managers in U.S companies.

The legality of the OPT program is being challenged by a lawsuit from the Immigration Reform Law Institute. The lawsuit has prompted a huge pushback from billionaire investors, including Bloomberg, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg. The program is important to investors because their stock values rise by $25 billion whenever they can use India’s workers to push payroll costs down by another $1 billion.

The OPT program is also supported by the Indian government, which pressures legislators and U.S. investors to import more of India’s workers via the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy.

Warren has repeatedly denounced those wealthy investors, but her pro-OPT tweet leaves her allied with the very wealthy founders of a pro-OPT advocacy group, FWD.us.

Justice Dept. is defending OPT program that pays investors $2 bill p/year to hire 300K cheap foreign graduates instead of Americans.

It was created by GW Bush, Obama & lobbyists, not by Congress, says lawsuit.

This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it’s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Let’s talk about why Republicans are wrong on this.

She then shared the following five points to defend the idea:

1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes & everyone enjoys. We don’t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods. 2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone’s invested! 3. When you start carving people out & adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop. 4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren’t covered by tuition-free public college! 5. Lastly, and I can’t believe we have to remind people of this, but it’s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated. Having students from different incomes & backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society & economic mobility.

Kamala Harris' (D-CA) 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign is flailing, according to her current and former aides.",2019-11-29,Breitbart News,Kamala Harris Campaign Staff Admit: ‘We Still Do Not Have a Real Plan to Win’,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/29/kamala-harris-in-dire-financial-trouble/,"Sen. Kamala Harris’ (D-CA) 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign is flailing, according to her current and former aides.

A New York Times report reveals warring factions within Harris’ campaign against her Baltimore, Maryland and California-based staff, as well as financial woes that continue to get worse. As part of the Times‘ various interviews with current and former Harris staffers, the report details the recent resignation letter of the campaign’s operations director Kelly Mehlenbacher.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly…” Mehlenbacher wrote. “With less than 90 days until Iowa we still do not have a real plan to win.”

Mehlenbacher wrote that Harris’ campaign lacks “leaders who will lead,” calling the direction of the campaign with Harris’ sister, Maya, at the helm “unacceptable.” Mehlenbacher has since taken a top job for billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s newly-announced Democrat presidential bid.

Those sentiments are reflected in interviews, where one former Harris staffer told the Times that “You can’t run the country if you can’t run your campaign,” when speaking of the campaign’s disarray of messaging and leadership.

Harris’ financial issues have not gotten any better since the last Democrat debate, putting her in a “dire” situation that has left her staff wanting former aides to set up a super PAC to help them run ads that they, themselves, cannot afford [emphasis added]:

But her troubles go beyond staffing and strategy: Her financial predicament is dire. The campaign has not taken a poll or been able to afford TV advertising since September, and it has all but quit buying Facebook ads in the last two months. Her advisers, after months of resistance, have only now signaled their desire for a group of former aides to begin a super PAC to finance an independent political effort on her behalf. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, Harris’ staff complained her message has been all over the place. According to the Times, Harris first chose to use the word “truth” as a campaign slogan because it polled well with focus groups. In recent months, though, Harris has dropped the phrase to focus on the term “justice” where she plays up aspects of her prosecutorial career:

For a time, she sought to highlight a pragmatic agenda, about matters she said voters thought about while lying awake at 3 a.m. Today, her aides are given to gallows humor about just how many slogans and one-liners she has cycled through, with one recalling how “‘speak truth’ spring” gave way to “‘3 a.m.’ summer” before the current, Trump-focused “‘justice’ winter.” [Emphasis added]

Even in Harris’ home state of California, the former prosecutor has failed to break into the top tier of candidates in the state’s Democrat presidential primary — a problem that one of Harris’ donors, Susie Buell admitted to the Times.

“For her to lose California would be really hard and it’s not looking good,” Buell said.

In the latest SurveyUSA poll, Harris runs in fourth with just 10 percent in California behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Harris garners almost as much support in the state as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling at eight percent.

Leftists experienced a collective freakout this week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the arrest of dozens of foreign nationals committing visa fraud by enrolling in the fake university. It was “part of a sting operation by federal agents who enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India, to attend the school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies,” the Detroit Free Press reported.

As Breitbart News detailed:

The Indian workers enrolled in the fake university to get work permits via two federal programs. The two programs are the Optional Practical Training and the Curricular Practical Training programs. The two programs keep more than 400,000 foreign graduates in jobs sought by U.S. graduates and it provides billions in revenue for the U.S. investors, as well as the Indian-born hiring managers who traffick them into jobs in many companies throughout the U.S. economy. The OPT program also feeds foreign workers into the H-1B visa program, which allows employers to hire imported workers and then pay them with low wages and a promise of citizenship. The Indians knew the university was fake because it did not require them to take classes — which is similar to many other colleges around the United States which provide OPT to foreign workers on “Day One” of enrollment.

The news prompted wails from notable leftists. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called the practice “cruel and appalling,” while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) implied that the operation was an idea birthed by the Trump administration.

“Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP. I saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill,” she wrote.

“Nobody cared then how we’d pay for it. Now ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students,” she claimed. “Yet we were called radical for opposing it”:

However, the practice was not a concept birthed by the Trump administration, despite the implications from the political left and Hollywood elite. Similar operations occurred under the Obama administration at the fake University of Northern New Jersey, established in 2013.

“In many instances, the schools are nothing more than sham visa mills,” New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said of the “Pay to Stay” scheme in 2016, according to the Washington Post.

He continued:

They have no curriculum, no classes, no instructors, and no real students. These purported schools and their corrupt administrators simply give out I-20 [work permit] forms in exchange for payment. This illegal practice is known as ‘pay to stay’ because foreign nationals pay money to brokers and recruiters, like the defendants, to be enrolled in a school for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration status as a student — but with no intention of or interest in going to class or making any progress toward an academic degree.

“Although UNNJ was physically located here in New Jersey, in a real building in Cranford, the university was not a real school,” Fishman explained.

“Its only employees were undercover … agents posing as corrupt administrators. The school had no instructors or educators; it had no curriculum; and no actual classes or educational activities ever occurred there,” he continued.

“‘Pay to Stay’ schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs, they also pose a very real threat to national security,” he added, noting that the operation and subsequent arrests “stopped 21 brokers, recruiters and employers across multiple states who recklessly exploited our immigration system for financial gain.”

According to the Post, the fraud was relatively obvious.

Parts of conversations between defendants and UNNJ “staff” make clear how transparent the alleged fraud was. Zitong Wen and Chaun Kit Yuen, for example, are two Chinese nationals residing in California now charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit. Their indictment said they contacted UNNJ in 2014 “to offer their services as recruiting agents for purported foreign students.” But the alleged conversations were a little unusual. “You know that none of these people are going to class,” an undercover agent allegedly told Yeun. “[J]ust, you know, between us, you know, you’re good with that right? Make sure your clients are good with it too, okay? I don’t want anybody, you know, showing up at my doorstep thinking they’re gonna be in my … advanced calculus class or anything like that. … That’s not gonna happen, right? We know this is just to maintain status.”

Regarding the impact on the “students,” BuzzFeed reported:

He is now one of more than 1,000 former UNNJ students who had their visas terminated last week after the sting was made public by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. The sting was a multiyear effort, beginning in 2013, that led to 21 brokers and middlemen being indicted for conspiracy to commit visa fraud. Chang and his fellow students, though they escaped criminal charges, will need to leave the country within months; their visas will be flagged for fraud, making it extremely difficult for them to return to the United States. Some may be placed under “administrative arrest,” an ICE press release said.

What is more, The Detroit News reported that the University of Farmington’s operation started in 2015, prior to Trump’s first term, as “part of an undercover operation dubbed ‘Paper Chase.'”

It was “designed to identify recruiters and entities engaged in immigration fraud, according to the indictment,” it added, noting that Homeland Security agents “started posing as university officials in February 2017.”

“It’s creative and it’s not entrapment,” Wayne State University law professor Peter Henning said, according to the publication. “The government can put out the bait, but it’s up to the defendants to fall for it”:

Justice Dept. is defending OPT program that pays investors $2 bill p/year to hire 300K cheap foreign graduates instead of Americans.

It was created by GW Bush, Obama & lobbyists, not by Congress, says lawsuit.

Sensing a potential victory in Iowa, Mayor Pete Buttigieg launched an ad that goes after proposals from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to make tuition free at public colleges and universities.

""I believe we should move to make college affordable for everybody,"" Buttigieg says in the ad. ""There are some voices saying, 'Well that doesn't count unless you go even further, unless it's free even for the kids of millionaires. But I only want to make promises that we can keep.""

The mayor's critics have pounced on this line of attack. After all, some of the nation's most successful federal programs — such as Social Security, Medicare and K-12 public education — have been available to all Americans regardless of their income. Surely, he doesn't think that these programs are also misconceived?

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez weighed in with a warning on Twitter : ""This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition free public college.""

To be sure, it is more than legitimate for Democrats to attack proposals from their competitors as too bold or poorly conceived. It is healthy for Democrats to encounter tough criticism from every quarter to see who is best prepared to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.

But Democrats need to be cautious. There is a long history of Republican candidates using smears that unfairly characterize candidates or their policies against the Democratic party nominee. Very often the candidates who think of themselves as the most moderate in the bunch find themselves the target of rhetoric that they or one of their colleagues originally produced.

Democratic candidates who seek to paint themselves as the most moderate in the pack should not forget just how far the GOP is willing go to paint any of the nominees as wild-eyed socialist radicals. Democrats should not underestimate the importance of working as a party to frame the debate around key issues so that they don't end up giving bipartisan legitimacy to spurious conservative talking points.

During the height of the Cold War in the 1940s and 1950s, Democrats often went after each other by accusing others of being soft on communism. Prominent officials in the party castigated the left wing by charging that they were too radical. In doing so, they played into the strategy of equating domestic progressivism and international diplomacy with socialism. Former Vice President Henry Wallace was one of the prime victims of this kind of campaign.

Yet Democrats — from Presidents Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson — learned that they could not contain the fallout from this style of partisan warfare. Eventually, no matter how hawkish the Democrats were, Republicans went after them as being part of the party that was too weak on defense.

When former Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1972, he condemned South Dakota Sen. George McGovern for being weak on defense. Humphrey warned: ""Nor am I going to let Senator McGovern's defense proposals make America into second‐class power.""

McGovern won the nomination. President Richard Nixon put together a fierce campaign that tagged McGovern as a leftist who would endanger national security. Although McGovern had been a staunch internationalist who supported most of the Cold War strategy, Nixon was successful.

In 1984, Democrats were desperate to figure out who was the most electable Democrat to defeat President Ronald Reagan, who in their mind had brought the country into a dangerous era of conservatism, threatening global peace and the social safety net. Ohio Sen. John Glenn, who believed that he had the best chance to beat the Gipper, warned voters that Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale had supported dangerous cuts in defense spending that jeopardized key programs like the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter plane program.

JUST WATCHED Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa 03:29

After Mondale won the nomination, Reagan frequently turned to quotes from Democrats that depicted Mondale as coming from the dovish wing of the party, which he was not.

In 1988, during the Massachusetts primary, Al Gore brought up the state's weekend furlough program for prisoners. He did so to tag the state's technocratic Gov. Michael Dukakis as being far too liberal on crime, a big topic in the 1980s (though the furlough program was started by Dukakis' predecessor).

Republicans remembered what Gore had said when then-Vice President George H.W. Bush faced off against Dukakis in the general election. The GOP injected race into the story by highlighting the case of an African-American man named Willie Horton , who had escaped from the furlough program, raped a white woman and stabbed her partner. The Republican campaign effectively devastated Dukakis's image by summoning the case.

Similarly, in 2004 Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry went after Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who had been doing well in the race, speaking about his opposition to the disastrous war in Iraq. Kerry warned that Dean would be weak on defense after 9/11 and that his candidacy would ensure President George W. Bush's re-election.

Referring to Dean's statement that the US was not safer after Saddam Hussein had been captured, Kerry said: ""Someone who talks like this is going to have a hard time convincing the American people that he can keep them safe. This election is too vital for us to lose ... because voters refuse to take a gamble on national security and the steadiness of our leadership."" Although Kerry won the nomination, that became the centerpiece of GOP attacks against him.

Democrats who attack from the center don't always think through the potential impact of their words. They operate from a mythical position that they will be able to insulate themselves from the same such attacks if their turn comes in the crossfire. But we have seen from history it doesn't work that way.

The better strategy would be to shore up support for Democratic ideas and policies during the caucuses and primaries, insisting on a debate that centers on those terms rather than Republican points, and not offering the GOP more material going into the fall campaign.

For if they are not careful, the moderates might end up doing exactly what Republicans are hoping for, thereby helping to set up the conditions for President Trump's reelection.

Barney Frank (D-MA) said while Democratic presidential primaries were traditionally motivated by progressive ideology, the “anti-Trump” feeling among Democrats was so strong that it is pushing the party to a more electable center.

Frank said, “I do think the most interesting statistic there is take the two candidates who have been talking about being more aimed at beating Trump and more cognizant of the political constraints that exist on very far-reaching measures that’s the Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. They together have many, many more votes than Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. That’s the way it’s focused. Then if you throw in the others like Amy Klobuchar and even Bloomberg, I think the interesting point now is that the view that says it’s important for us to beat Trump and to do that we have to avoid things that are likely to alienate people, like Medicare for all which I agree is a problem. I think that’s a sign maybe after Obama’s speech that a consensus is emerging or at least a strong majority on the Democratic side for electability, still with a very liberal program.”

He continued, “The point is not what the die-hards think, but how many there are? Look at the numbers, look at Biden and Buttigieg and throw in Klobuchar and Bloomberg.”

He added, “Elizabeth Warren is a very intelligent, very smart candidate. She tried to move off of Medicare for all. I don’t think she did it as successfully politically as she was hoping, but she understood that. There are differences between her and Sanders on this. So, yeah, I do think that a majority of those who will vote on the Democratic side — here’s the issue, usually the most ideologically motivated are more likely to vote in primaries. The anti-trump feeling is so strong among Democrats I think for very good reason that it becomes an equal turnout driver with the usual positive ‘Oh, we must make enormous changes.'”

He concluded, “Bloomberg is not pulling the party to the center. He is hoping to catch on to what was already happening. You already have a centrist majority.”

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) outraising his Democrat presidential counterparts in the Sooner State.

Sanders is outraising his competitors in Oklahoma, garnering $89,468, which is comprised of small donations, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data running through September 30.

“Working families across Oklahoma are giving $3, $18, $27 or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders,” Sanders spokesman Joe Calvello said, according to the Oklahoman.

“Our team is immensely proud of the grassroots support we have across the state and the operation we are building. In 2016, Bernie won the Oklahoma primary in a dominating fashion, and we plan to do the same thing in 2020,” he added.

As a comparison, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has raised $66,074 in the same time frame, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) has raised $58,649.

While Bloomberg is not taking donations for his primary bid, he reportedly spent $300,000 on advertisements on the Super Tuesday state in recent days.

The Oklahoman reports:

Candidate filing for Oklahoma’s presidential primaries begins on Monday and runs through Wednesday. Oklahoma will be part of Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states, including Texas, California, Arkansas and Colorado, are expected to hold their contests. Sanders, of Vermont, won Oklahoma’s Democratic presidential primary in 2016, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The senator has the most extensive organization in Oklahoma this year and has already visited the state, holding events in Norman and Lawton in September.

Oklahoma plays a key role in Bloomberg’s controversial Super Tuesday strategy, virtually ignoring the first four contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.

“Our campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,” Sanders said during a rally in Coralville, Iowa, this month.

“So tonight, we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, ‘Sorry, you ain’t going to buy this election,'” he continued.

“You’re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. You’re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California,” he added. “Those days are gone”:

Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you’re not going to buy this election. pic.twitter.com/15sVnuPxwR — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 10, 2019

Sanders also said he was “disgusted” by Bloomberg’s multimillion-dollar ad blitz.

“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections,” Sanders said in a statement.

“It’s just the latest example of a rigged political system that we are going to change when we’re in the White House,” he continued.

“If you can’t build grassroots support for your candidacy, you have no business running for president,” he added. “The American people are sick and tired of the power of billionaires, and I suspect they won’t react well to someone trying to buy an election.”

Meanwhile, President Trump has seen an extraordinary amount of support from Oklahomans.

“President Trump and the Republican National Committee continue to set record-breaking fundraising numbers in Oklahoma and across the country, Trump reelection campaign spokeswoman Samantha Cotten told the paper.

“While Democrats spend their time focusing on partisan witch hunts and pushing socialist policies, President Trump and Republicans are in prime position to win up and down the ballot in 2020,” she added."

Warren on Friday tweeted a flashback clip featuring remarks she made on the campaign trail in Andover, Massachusetts, in 2011.

“It’s a point I’ve made since my very first campaign: Nobody in this country got rich on their own. They relied on infrastructure we all paid for, employees we all paid to educate,” she wrote.

“So if you’re successful, good for you—now pay it forward so everyone has a chance at success,” she added:

The flashback features Warren stumping with her hallmark “you didn’t build that” narrative:

You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear: you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for.

“You didn’t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did,” she continued.

“Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along,” she said to applause.

Former President Obama echoed the same sentiment in 2012, telling a group at a campaign event in Roanoke, Virginia, that successful Americans “didn’t get there” on their own.

Obama said:

There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me — because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t — look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.

The remarks made in Warren’s flashback have become a staple of her presidential campaign, although she has notably shifted her rhetoric toward billionaires, specifically.

“Look I don’t have a beef with billionaires,” Warren claimed during the October 15 debate.

“My problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America – I guarantee – you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate,” Warren said.

“You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part by protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for,” she continued.

“All I’m saying is, you make it to the top of one-tenth of one percent, then pitch in the two cents so every other kid in America has the chance,” she added.

As Breitbart News noted, Warren’s claim – that she does not have a “beef” with billionaires – has been contradicted by the statements she has made on the campaign trail, particularly since Michael Bloomberg’s entry into the presidential race.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban suggested that the presidential hopeful has focused on pushing wealth tax proposals in order to divert attention from her own wealth.

This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, & it’s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Let’s talk about why Republicans are wrong on this.

She then shared the following five points to defend the idea:

1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes & everyone enjoys. We don’t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods. 2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone’s invested! 3. When you start carving people out & adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop. 4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren’t covered by tuition-free public college! 5. Lastly, and I can’t believe we have to remind people of this, but it’s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated. Having students from different incomes & backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society & economic mobility.

Biden, who has been eclipsed by the likes of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in Iowa and New Hampshire, continues to dominate the Democrat field in South Carolina. Since announcing his candidacy in April, the former vice president has led in every single poll coming out of Palmetto State by double digits.

Biden’s standing among South Carolina Democrats was on display in a recent CBS/YouGov survey that found the former vice president leading his nearest challenger, Warren, by 28 percentage points. The former vice president’s dominance has been mostly fueled by strong support from black voters, who by most estimates will make up more than 60 percent of South Carolina’s primary electorate in 2020. An October poll conducted by Winthrop University indicated Biden was the favored candidate of 46 percent of black Democrats across South Carolina.

Such strong support from the black community is mirrored nationally and has remained unabated despite contentious revelations about the former vice president’s opposition to busing and his more recent praise of segregationist Democrats. Now some strategists wonder, however, if black voters will stick by Biden were he to falter in the first three nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire, in Nevada.

“The support won’t be there if he’s slipping,” a Democrat strategist told the Hill. “There’s just no way.”

The notion of Biden not winning, let alone landing in the top three in the Iowa Caucuses or the New Hampshire and Nevada primaries, seemed impossible when he first entered the race.

A poll conducted in Iowa only a month after Biden’s announcement, found the former vice president leading his rivals by nearly ten percentage points. Biden maintained that lead until early September, when news of his youngest son’s foreign wheeling and dealing took center stage in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Since then, Biden has steadily fallen, most recently hitting fourth place in Iowa behind Buttigieg, Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

Similarly, the former vice president has lost ground in New Hampshire, which at one point seemed like fertile territory given its large working class population. Polling conducted by Monmouth University in May had Biden commanding 36 percent of New Hampshire’s Democrat electorate, 18 percentage points more than his nearest rival. Now the former vice president finds himself firmly in fourth place behind Buttigieg, Sanders, and Warren, according to polling averages analyzed by Real Clear Politics.

Of the three early nominating contests prior to South Carolina, Nevada seems to present Biden’s brightest opportunity. The former vice president continues to hold a healthy lead over his rivals in the state, as much as ten percentage points according to a recent survey.

Although Nevada looks promising for Biden, the state is by no means a lock. Not only is Nevada a caucus state with its own intrepid procedures for gauging candidate support, but its Democrat electorate is heavily influenced by both former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and the heavily Hispanic Culinary Workers Union.

Reid, for his part, has opted against endorsing a candidate as of yet, in hopes of using his wide reaching political machine to play kingmaker down the line. Even though Reid has yet to make an endorsement, his former top Senate staffers have been openly critical of Biden.

Adding to the former vice president’s problems in Nevada is the likelihood that his moderate stand on immigration will be a nonstarter for many of the state’s Hispanic activists, including those belonging to groups like the Culinary Workers Union. The union, which represents more than 60,000 hospitality workers from 173 different countries, is both Nevada’s largest labor organization and its biggest immigrant advocacy group.

In recent years, the union has taken a more proactive stance on protecting its members from facing deportation or being subject to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Earlier this month, the union snubbed Biden, who has refused to end all deportations if elected president, in favor of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with an invitation to address its membership.

Biden’s precarious standing in Nevada and his overall troubles in Iowa and New Hampshire pose the very real possibility that the former vice president will be running far behind by the time voters go to the polls in South Carolina. If that is the case, senior Democrats believe black voters will have no choice but to start considering other candidates, especially as momentum and media attention will be focused on those who finished at the top in the three early states.

“Savvy black voters will reassess their options,” Basil Smikle, a Democrat strategist, told the Hill when asked about Biden’s chances of keeping black voters in his column. “Every candidate will have to remake their case to, and reaffirm their policy prescriptions for, the African American community — Biden included.”

Complicating matters for the former vice president is that he has history working against him. In recent memory, only two candidates for either the Democrat or Republican nominations have gone on to win South Carolina after faltering in the first three nominating contest.

In both cases, John Edwards in 2004 and Newt Gingrich in 2012, the victories in South Carolina served as temporary aberrations. Not only did further wins fail to materialize, but both candidates were outflanked in the money and resources race by the eventual nominee, who had scored early and decisive victories in the first three contests.

Biden, himself, seems to understand that a loss in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada would likely impact his credibility as a candidate with black voters in South Carolina. As such, the former vice president’s campaign has made a massive investment of time and advertising in Iowa in recent weeks despite downplaying its chances in the state in September.

“Losing Iowa doesn’t mean we can’t win, but it makes winning the primary harder and more expensive,” Greg Schultz, Biden’s campaign manager, wrote in a recent fundraising email to supporters. “We still have time to turn this around … but not much.”"

Kamala Harris’ (D-CA) 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign is flailing, according to her current and former aides.

A New York Times report reveals warring factions within Harris’ campaign against her Baltimore, Maryland and California-based staff, as well as financial woes that continue to get worse. As part of the Times‘ various interviews with current and former Harris staffers, the report details the recent resignation letter of the campaign’s operations director Kelly Mehlenbacher.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly…” Mehlenbacher wrote. “With less than 90 days until Iowa we still do not have a real plan to win.”

Mehlenbacher wrote that Harris’ campaign lacks “leaders who will lead,” calling the direction of the campaign with Harris’ sister, Maya, at the helm “unacceptable.” Mehlenbacher has since taken a top job for billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s newly-announced Democrat presidential bid.

Those sentiments are reflected in interviews, where one former Harris staffer told the Times that “You can’t run the country if you can’t run your campaign,” when speaking of the campaign’s disarray of messaging and leadership.

Harris’ financial issues have not gotten any better since the last Democrat debate, putting her in a “dire” situation that has left her staff wanting former aides to set up a super PAC to help them run ads that they, themselves, cannot afford [emphasis added]:

But her troubles go beyond staffing and strategy: Her financial predicament is dire. The campaign has not taken a poll or been able to afford TV advertising since September, and it has all but quit buying Facebook ads in the last two months. Her advisers, after months of resistance, have only now signaled their desire for a group of former aides to begin a super PAC to finance an independent political effort on her behalf. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, Harris’ staff complained her message has been all over the place. According to the Times, Harris first chose to use the word “truth” as a campaign slogan because it polled well with focus groups. In recent months, though, Harris has dropped the phrase to focus on the term “justice” where she plays up aspects of her prosecutorial career:

For a time, she sought to highlight a pragmatic agenda, about matters she said voters thought about while lying awake at 3 a.m. Today, her aides are given to gallows humor about just how many slogans and one-liners she has cycled through, with one recalling how “‘speak truth’ spring” gave way to “‘3 a.m.’ summer” before the current, Trump-focused “‘justice’ winter.” [Emphasis added]

Even in Harris’ home state of California, the former prosecutor has failed to break into the top tier of candidates in the state’s Democrat presidential primary — a problem that one of Harris’ donors, Susie Buell admitted to the Times.

“For her to lose California would be really hard and it’s not looking good,” Buell said.

In the latest SurveyUSA poll, Harris runs in fourth with just 10 percent in California behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Harris garners almost as much support in the state as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling at eight percent.

Leftists experienced a collective freakout this week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the arrest of dozens of foreign nationals committing visa fraud by enrolling in the fake university. It was “part of a sting operation by federal agents who enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India, to attend the school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies,” the Detroit Free Press reported.

As Breitbart News detailed:

The Indian workers enrolled in the fake university to get work permits via two federal programs. The two programs are the Optional Practical Training and the Curricular Practical Training programs. The two programs keep more than 400,000 foreign graduates in jobs sought by U.S. graduates and it provides billions in revenue for the U.S. investors, as well as the Indian-born hiring managers who traffick them into jobs in many companies throughout the U.S. economy. The OPT program also feeds foreign workers into the H-1B visa program, which allows employers to hire imported workers and then pay them with low wages and a promise of citizenship. The Indians knew the university was fake because it did not require them to take classes — which is similar to many other colleges around the United States which provide OPT to foreign workers on “Day One” of enrollment.

The news prompted wails from notable leftists. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called the practice “cruel and appalling,” while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) implied that the operation was an idea birthed by the Trump administration.

“Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP. I saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill,” she wrote.

“Nobody cared then how we’d pay for it. Now ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students,” she claimed. “Yet we were called radical for opposing it”:

However, the practice was not a concept birthed by the Trump administration, despite the implications from the political left and Hollywood elite. Similar operations occurred under the Obama administration at the fake University of Northern New Jersey, established in 2013.

“In many instances, the schools are nothing more than sham visa mills,” New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said of the “Pay to Stay” scheme in 2016, according to the Washington Post.

He continued:

They have no curriculum, no classes, no instructors, and no real students. These purported schools and their corrupt administrators simply give out I-20 [work permit] forms in exchange for payment. This illegal practice is known as ‘pay to stay’ because foreign nationals pay money to brokers and recruiters, like the defendants, to be enrolled in a school for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration status as a student — but with no intention of or interest in going to class or making any progress toward an academic degree.

“Although UNNJ was physically located here in New Jersey, in a real building in Cranford, the university was not a real school,” Fishman explained.

“Its only employees were undercover … agents posing as corrupt administrators. The school had no instructors or educators; it had no curriculum; and no actual classes or educational activities ever occurred there,” he continued.

“‘Pay to Stay’ schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs, they also pose a very real threat to national security,” he added, noting that the operation and subsequent arrests “stopped 21 brokers, recruiters and employers across multiple states who recklessly exploited our immigration system for financial gain.”

According to the Post, the fraud was relatively obvious.

Parts of conversations between defendants and UNNJ “staff” make clear how transparent the alleged fraud was. Zitong Wen and Chaun Kit Yuen, for example, are two Chinese nationals residing in California now charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit. Their indictment said they contacted UNNJ in 2014 “to offer their services as recruiting agents for purported foreign students.” But the alleged conversations were a little unusual. “You know that none of these people are going to class,” an undercover agent allegedly told Yeun. “[J]ust, you know, between us, you know, you’re good with that right? Make sure your clients are good with it too, okay? I don’t want anybody, you know, showing up at my doorstep thinking they’re gonna be in my … advanced calculus class or anything like that. … That’s not gonna happen, right? We know this is just to maintain status.”

Regarding the impact on the “students,” BuzzFeed reported:

He is now one of more than 1,000 former UNNJ students who had their visas terminated last week after the sting was made public by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. The sting was a multiyear effort, beginning in 2013, that led to 21 brokers and middlemen being indicted for conspiracy to commit visa fraud. Chang and his fellow students, though they escaped criminal charges, will need to leave the country within months; their visas will be flagged for fraud, making it extremely difficult for them to return to the United States. Some may be placed under “administrative arrest,” an ICE press release said.

What is more, The Detroit News reported that the University of Farmington’s operation started in 2015, prior to Trump’s first term, as “part of an undercover operation dubbed ‘Paper Chase.'”

It was “designed to identify recruiters and entities engaged in immigration fraud, according to the indictment,” it added, noting that Homeland Security agents “started posing as university officials in February 2017.”

“It’s creative and it’s not entrapment,” Wayne State University law professor Peter Henning said, according to the publication. “The government can put out the bait, but it’s up to the defendants to fall for it”:

The progressive stampede was started by the Detroit Free Press, which shouted “ICE” into the nation’s political theater on November 27.

But the newspaper buried the facts in the sixteenth paragraph, which explained why the Indians were breaking the law when they signed up at a no-show university to get fast-track work permits. The Indians used the work permits to grab white-collar jobs sought by American college graduates.

Democrats stampeded over a rhetorical cliff.

“DHS tricked immigrant students with the promise of education, cheating them out of millions of dollars,” said a tweet from Minnesota Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Then ICE arrested them. … This has always been about dehumanizing black and brown people. It must end now,” she said in a tweet that received 25,000 responses.

“Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP. … Now ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students,” said a tweet from New York Democrat Rep. Ocasio Cortez. Her tweet got 120,000 responses.

“This story is WILD,” said a tweet from Lis Power, the “Director of Media Intelligence” at Media Matters for America. “ICE created a fake university, then: – enticed foreign-born students to attend – charged them money – arrested them – deported them Students had come legally on student visas, but since the school was fake the visas weren’t valid,” said her tweet, which got 370,000 responses.

“This is cruel and appalling,” said a tweet from Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s Twitter team, which got 34,000 responses. “These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them”:

The tweets spotlighted the Democrats’ emotional commitment to foreigners and their visceral dislike of Americans’ border defenses.

But the progressives’ stampede was also caused by their prior disregard of the widespread fraud in the business-backed visa-worker programs. Those programs include the H-1B, L-1, OPT, and J-1 programs, which keep roughly 1.5 million foreign graduates in jobs sought by American graduates. These foreign workers grab many well-paid jobs in coastal states — and also demote unaware American graduates to lower-wage, lower-status careers in provincial towns — while cutting billions of dollars from investors’ payrolls.

The Detroit Free Press touted the news about the Indian deportations yet buried the description of the Indian fraud under an Indian lawyer’s insistence of innocence:

The U.S. “trapped the vulnerable people who just wanted to maintain (legal immigration) status,” Rahul Reddy, a Texas attorney who represented or advised some of the students arrested, told the Free Press this week. “They preyed upon on [sic] them.”

Reddy is the in-house lawyer for Indian-run software contractors at the Texas-based ITServe Alliance. The companies hire many of the estimated 50,000 Indian graduates who get OPT work permits from colleges each year.

Many Indian visa workers are ready to participate in fraudulent tactics because fraud is endemic in India.

Once in the United States, fraud is rational because it helps many — not all — Indian temporary workers win the hugely valuable prizes of Americans’ white-collar jobs and of American citizenship:

GAO warns DHS to do more to prevent the smuggling of Indian and Chinese graduates into U.S. white-collar careers, such as software, healthcare, accounting, etc. Most smuggling takes place via the universities' 'OPT' work-permit giveaway to foreign grads. https://t.co/NSUIVQDO4m — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2019

Americans’ professional codes of ethics have minimized domestic fraud in U.S. workplaces.

But those codes blind Americans to the diversity of tactics used by many of the Indian graduates, such as inflating resumes, trading bribes for jobs, hiring relatives, and excluding unsuspecting Americans from job interviews. Some Indian workers readily provide anecdotal evidence of these practices to American reporters who want to listen.

But there is little legal enforcement of workplace laws.

The result is that some Indian managers can run U.S. offices where the vast majority of new hires are Indians, apparently without any fear that American officials will investigate the obviously skewed hiring patterns for racial, sexual, and anti-American discrimination.

Alongside the Democrat politicians, many progressive journalists rushed to condemn ICE’s successful operation.

The denunciations came from Politico’s Natasha Bertrand, Mark Bergen at Bloomberg, Matt Pearce at the Los Angeles Times, and Kyle Griffin at MSNBC. “Abolish ICE,” reacted Farhad Manjoo, an immigrant columnist at the New York Times. “Leave it to the Trump administration to use a fake university. … How is this anything but entrapment?” said a tweet from Jamil Smith at Rolling Stone.

Radley Balko at the Washington Post declared ICE’s success as “so goddamned evil.” Matthew Chapman of The Raw Story tweeted, “How have these students even committed a crime?”

Establishment editors also skewed the coverage Axios tweeted: “ICE has arrested about 250 foreign students for immigration violations because they enrolled in a fake university created by the Department of Homeland Security, the Detroit Free Press reports,” although the site’s linked article explained the fraud. “ICE set up a fake university, then arrested 250 people it gave student visas to,” said a misleading tweet from the Washington Post.

The ICE sting at the fake Farmington University worked because many Indian visa workers have become complacent about the enforcement of U.S. workplace laws.

Obama’s deputies created the fake university to target the Indians who use fraud to get work permits via the Occupational Practical Training (OPT) program for foreign graduates and the Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program for foreign students.

Those work permits were created and expanded by U.S. presidents seeking to placate high-tech investors, such as Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. The OPT and CPT work permits allow the Indian graduates to fly into the United States, pay their tuition, and then compete for the many low wage jobs offered by Indian managers at many U.S. companies. Those started jobs then allow the Indians to compete for coveted H-1B work permits, which allow them to apply for the hugely valuable prize of citizenship.

These OPT and CPT jobs are varied and range from starvation wage jobs in Texas software sweatshops to $100,000 prestige jobs in Silicon Valley. The actual wages are difficult to track, partly because employers frequently shortchange their Indian workers and demand kickbacks. Indians are willing to pay the kickbacks because their U.S.-based Indian managers have the legal power to send them home or provide the hugely valuable prize of U.S. citizenship.

The huge number of Indian visa workers has also ensured that fraud, caste politics, and bribery are increasingly common in workplaces that were once dominated by American white-collar professionals. For example, many U.S. professionals report anonymously that a large number of Indian managers only hire Indians and also refuse to hire Americans who cannot be trusted to stay quiet about kickbacks. Some of these complaints are documented by a growing number of lawsuits against Indian managers in U.S companies.

The federal government provides some data about the American universities that accept tuition payments in exchange for awarding OPT and CPT work permits to the Chinese, Indian, and other foreign competitors of their American graduates.

The data also shows the companies where managers are using the programs to hire foreign graduates instead of Americans.

Amid the Democrat stampede, Michigan Democrats Qasim Rashid declared the DHS success “horrifying.”

Progressive activists also jumped in, including Amy Siskind, “Black Lives Matter” activist Shaun King, Dianna Anderson, jihad-enthusiast Linda Sarsour, and David Cay Johnston.

Generally, establishment media outlets have ignored the many OPT and H-1B scandals — even though both have created political problems for President Donald Trump — but this progressive stampede may encourage more attention:"
