She’s run a substantive campaign, and the press loves her gotta-plan-for-everything approach almost as much as her steady rise in the polls.
Joe Biden?… [+4068 chars]",Resolved: Elizabeth Warren has gotten the best coverage of any presidential candidate since Barack Obama.,2019-11-08,Fox News,"Media elite may oppose Warren, but she sure gets good press",https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-elite-may-oppose-warren-but-she-sure-gets-good-press,"Resolved: Elizabeth Warren has gotten the best coverage of any presidential candidate since Barack Obama.

She’s run a substantive campaign, and the press loves her gotta-plan-for-everything approach almost as much as her steady rise in the polls.

Joe Biden? The left can’t stand him. The Nation just ran an “anti-endorsement” urging Biden to drop out, saying he’d been “picking up where the Obama administration left off: a restoration of business as usual for the K Street lobbyists and Wall Street speculators.”

MEDIA TRUMPET KENTUCKY VOTE AS TRUMP FAVORITE FACES DEFEAT

But Warren would be the scourge of the big bankers, checks all the progressive boxes and isn’t a white male to boot. No wonder Bill Gates is openly worrying that she’ll soak him for $100 billion.

Sure, the Massachusetts senator is starting to get a tad more scrutiny since she unveiled a $20-trillion plan to pay for Medicare for All, after months of finessing journalists’ questions on the issue. And there was an “SNL” skit with Kate McKinnon portraying her as a know-it-all playing with funny money—not exactly Alec Baldwin territory.

But these have been dwarfed by glowing profiles of her time in Oklahoma, or at Harvard, or even as a bankruptcy lawyer, and how she developed into a fierce consumer advocate.

So why is a founding editor of Politico suggesting the press is giving her short shrift?

The argument John Harris makes in his new column is that reporters talk to downbeat Democrats who are chattering about Warren and “her embrace of mandatory ‘Medicare for All.’ By these lights: The plan is wildly expensive, unrealistic, frightening to moderate voters in key swing states who want to dump Trump but need reassurance before empowering a liberal in the Oval Office.”

After all, how much of an albatross would it be in a fall campaign when more voters learn that Warren would kick 150 million Americans off private insurance in favor of a massive government-run program?

Harris, a former Washington Post reporter, concludes that “the more pervasive force shaping coverage of Washington and elections is what might be thought of as centrist bias, flowing from reporters and sources alike. It is a headwind for Warren, Sanders, the ‘squad’ on Capitol Hill, even for Trump. This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”

Harris admits to this bias, and then challenges himself to provide the other side.

Warren, he writes, “is ready to divide the county and her party over the proposition that a much more aggressive role for government is needed to bring business to heel and protect individuals and the global climate from the predations of a free market…Fundamental societal change comes from people burning with grievances, obsessed with remedies, ready to demolish old power arrangements to achieve their ends.”

In other words, it’s risky and aggressive candidates who wind up changing society, such as Trump in 2016, not the wise and seasoned incrementalists. In fact, it’s the media establishment and Beltway mandarins that have brought us such debacles as the Iraq war and 2008 financial meltdown.

Well, maybe. But first you’ve gotta get elected. And Democrats have to decide whether Warren represents their best shot.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post takes some relatively mild criticism of Warren from Biden and Pete Buttigieg to ask whether they are getting into “one of the most fraught areas for a female candidate: Is she likable?”

Buttigieg criticized Warren’s “my way or the highway approach” and said she is “so absorbed in the fighting that it is as though fighting were the purpose.” Biden said she reflects “an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.”

These are garden-variety jabs in politics. They’re not saying she’s personally angry. They’re saying she’s a rigid ideologue who doesn’t like compromise—just what you’d expect from rivals occupying the moderate lane.

If even policy-based criticism of Elizabeth Warren is ruled suspect, she’ll sail to the nomination, despite the misgivings of the media and political establishment."

""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing. But the late timing of our entry means that many candidates already have a big head start in the four early states, where they've spent months and months campaigning and spending money,” Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said in a statement.

BIDEN ON BLOOMBERG: 'I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HIM GETTING IN THE RACE'

“We have enormous respect for the Democratic primary process and many friends in those states, but our plan is to run a broad-based, national campaign,” he added.

Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina are the first four states to kick off the presidential nominating calendar. They are scheduled to hold their caucuses and primaries in February of next year, ahead of the rest of the country.

Top-tier candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have built up strong organizations – with plenty of boots on the ground - in the early voting states.

Bloomberg flirted with a presidential bid early this year – including a swing through New Hampshire - but in March ruled out a 2020 White House run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

On Friday, Bloomberg aides filed paperwork in Alabama to designate him as a candidate in that state’s Democratic presidential primary just ahead of the deadline.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News the next primary ballot deadline he faces as he takes concrete steps towards launching a White House bid is Tuesday in Arkansas

But it's all but certain Bloomberg won’t travel to New Hampshire before the November 15 deadline for candidates to place their name on the ballot in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Minutes after Bloomberg’s announcement, New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley responded.

“We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn't run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states,” Buckley wrote.

“New Hampshire and other early state voters are some of the most engaged voters in the country,"" the longtime state party chair added. ""They ask tough questions that prepare the candidates for what's to come in the general election. It's unfortunate that Michael Bloomberg doesn't want to participate in this invaluable, important, and unique primary process and be tested the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.""

And Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price tweeted that ""it's disappointing to hear that Mayor Bloomberg doesn’t plan on competing in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses or the other three early nominating states.""

Retail campaigning is a crucial compenent of campaign politics in Iowa and New Hampshire, with some voters in both states often meeting and asking qusetions of the candidates multiple times during the course of a presidential primary cycle.

If Bloomberg follows through and officially enters the race, he's expected to spend millions of his own money on his White House bid, lauching TV and digital ads from coast to coast as he likely runs a national campaign.

But Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang, who's campaigned extensively in Iowa and New Hampshire over the past year and a half, predicted that Bloomberg is ""going to have a uphill climb in the race.""

Speaking to reporters after he filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot - hours before Bloomberg's announced decision to skip the early voting states - Yang said “there are somethings money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible.""

""I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him,"" Yang added."

4,Associated Press,Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema… [+5426 chars],Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema…,2019-11-11,Fox News,Buttigieg backs female as VA secy as Dems release vet plans,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-backs-female-as-va-secy-as-dems-release-vet-plans,"Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping female vets.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Sunday.

Sanders was taking questions at a green jobs town hall in Charles City, Iowa, when he was asked for his opinion on mandatory buybacks of AR15s and AK47s.

""I don't support — a mandatory buyback is essentially confiscation, which I think is unconstitutional,"" he replied. ""It means that I am going to walk into your house and take something whether you like it or not. I don't think that stands up to constitutional scrutiny.""

Sanders shared his gun control plan, which included taking an adversarial stance against the National Rifle Association, increasing background checks and banning the sale of assault weapons.

""We cannot allow the NRA to dictate policy because they've intimidated [President] Trump and they've intimidated the Republican party,"" he added. ""I'm not going to be intimidated by them.""

BETO SAYS POLICE WOULD ENFORCE GUN CONFISCATION UNDER HIS BUYBACK PLAN: 'THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCES'

Former fellow 2020 candidate Beto O'Rourke was an outspoken advocate of mandatory gun buybacks for assault-style weapons and made it a centerpiece of his campaign.

In September at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, O'Rourke called for mandatory buybacks, red flag laws, and a national registry, all in the same speech.

""A gun registry in this country, licensing for every American who owns a firearm, and every single one of those AR-15s and AK-47s will be bought back so they’re not on our streets, not in our homes, [and] do not take the lives of our fellow Americans,"" O'Rourke said.

This isn't the first time the issue of gun buybacks has been thrust into the spotlight and criticized by the Democratic presidential field. In October, South Bend Mayor and 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg agreed with Sanders that buybacks are akin to confiscation. He drew fire from fellow candidates Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who supported the plan.

Last month, before withdrawing from the race, O'Rourke said police officers would have to enforce the buybacks and enter private homes to carry out the confiscation.

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”



Pergram: The ‘impeachment resolution,’ and Dems' fight over its meaning - Fox News: “It didn’t matter what that resolution was called or wasn’t called a few weeks ago. Congress has descended into impeachapalooza. There’s no quibbling about what’s consuming Capitol Hill. Some Democrats may fret about the political ramifications of impeachment. Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

BLOOMBERG'S BARRIERS TO RUNNING AND WINNING THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Nov. 7-11, with 451 Iowa voters likely to take part in the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."
8,Associated Press,Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema… [+5426 chars],Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema…,2019-11-11,Fox News,Buttigieg backs female as VA secy as Dems release vet plans,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-backs-female-as-va-secy-as-dems-release-vet-plans,"Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping female vets.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Sunday.

Sanders was taking questions at a green jobs town hall in Charles City, Iowa, when he was asked for his opinion on mandatory buybacks of AR15s and AK47s.

""I don't support — a mandatory buyback is essentially confiscation, which I think is unconstitutional,"" he replied. ""It means that I am going to walk into your house and take something whether you like it or not. I don't think that stands up to constitutional scrutiny.""

Sanders shared his gun control plan, which included taking an adversarial stance against the National Rifle Association, increasing background checks and banning the sale of assault weapons.

""We cannot allow the NRA to dictate policy because they've intimidated [President] Trump and they've intimidated the Republican party,"" he added. ""I'm not going to be intimidated by them.""

BETO SAYS POLICE WOULD ENFORCE GUN CONFISCATION UNDER HIS BUYBACK PLAN: 'THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCES'

Former fellow 2020 candidate Beto O'Rourke was an outspoken advocate of mandatory gun buybacks for assault-style weapons and made it a centerpiece of his campaign.

In September at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, O'Rourke called for mandatory buybacks, red flag laws, and a national registry, all in the same speech.

""A gun registry in this country, licensing for every American who owns a firearm, and every single one of those AR-15s and AK-47s will be bought back so they’re not on our streets, not in our homes, [and] do not take the lives of our fellow Americans,"" O'Rourke said.

This isn't the first time the issue of gun buybacks has been thrust into the spotlight and criticized by the Democratic presidential field. In October, South Bend Mayor and 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg agreed with Sanders that buybacks are akin to confiscation. He drew fire from fellow candidates Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who supported the plan.

Last month, before withdrawing from the race, O'Rourke said police officers would have to enforce the buybacks and enter private homes to carry out the confiscation.

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat. … In her new post as fundraising director, Israel is taking on the daunting task of raising up to $70 million for next July's big event.”



SUPREME COURT DIVIDED OVER FUTURE OF DACA

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”



Widow Rep. Elijah Cummings announces campaign for husband's seat - Fox News: “The widow of late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on Monday that she will launch a campaign to win her husband’s seat as representative of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, initially told The Baltimore Sun that she would formally announce her campaign on Tuesday, nearly a month after her husband died of cancer on Oct. 17 at age 68. … In her first televised interview since her husband’s death, Rockeymoore Cummings said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show Monday evening that she and her husband decided about six months ago that she would be the best fit to carry on his legacy and vision for the Baltimore district.

AUDIBLE: ‘THE ENEMY WITHIN’

“Our politics are paralyzing the country. We practice suspicion or contempt where trust is needed, imposing a sentence of anger and loneliness on others and ourselves. We scorch our opponents with language that precludes compromise. We brush aside the possibility that a person with whom we disagree might be right. We talk about what divides us and seldom acknowledge what unites us. … Contending viewpoints and vocal dissent are inevitable, and not the issue. … What is dangerous is not that people have serious differences. It is the tone—the snarl, the scorn, the lacerating despair.” – Former Defense Secretary James Mattis in his piece “The Enemy Within,” published in the Atlantic.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”



THE RULEBOOK: TAKE NOTE

TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”



Pergram: The ‘impeachment resolution,’ and Dems' fight over its meaning - Fox News: “It didn’t matter what that resolution was called or wasn’t called a few weeks ago. Congress has descended into impeachapalooza. There’s no quibbling about what’s consuming Capitol Hill. Some Democrats may fret about the political ramifications of impeachment. Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

BLOOMBERG'S BARRIERS TO RUNNING AND WINNING THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

On the roster: GOP on defense ahead of public impeachment hearings - Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa - Supreme Court divided over future of DACA - La. governor’s race sees record number in early voting - Marathon man



GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat. … In her new post as fundraising director, Israel is taking on the daunting task of raising up to $70 million for next July's big event.”



SUPREME COURT DIVIDED OVER FUTURE OF DACA

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”



Widow Rep. Elijah Cummings announces campaign for husband's seat - Fox News: “The widow of late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on Monday that she will launch a campaign to win her husband’s seat as representative of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, initially told The Baltimore Sun that she would formally announce her campaign on Tuesday, nearly a month after her husband died of cancer on Oct. 17 at age 68. … In her first televised interview since her husband’s death, Rockeymoore Cummings said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show Monday evening that she and her husband decided about six months ago that she would be the best fit to carry on his legacy and vision for the Baltimore district.

AUDIBLE: ‘THE ENEMY WITHIN’

“Our politics are paralyzing the country. We practice suspicion or contempt where trust is needed, imposing a sentence of anger and loneliness on others and ourselves. We scorch our opponents with language that precludes compromise. We brush aside the possibility that a person with whom we disagree might be right. We talk about what divides us and seldom acknowledge what unites us. … Contending viewpoints and vocal dissent are inevitable, and not the issue. … What is dangerous is not that people have serious differences. It is the tone—the snarl, the scorn, the lacerating despair.” – Former Defense Secretary James Mattis in his piece “The Enemy Within,” published in the Atlantic.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,506 Nevada voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 627 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic caucus. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters and plus or minus 4 points for Democratic caucusgoers."

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries.

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

AUDIBLE: THESE GO TO 11

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,506 Nevada voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 627 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic caucus. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters and plus or minus 4 points for Democratic caucusgoers."

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,504 North Carolina voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 669 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic primary and 574 the GOP primary. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters, 3.5 points for Democratic primary voters, and 4 points for GOP primary voters."

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries.

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY, INDEED

“If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 61



TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6.

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""You've got the Iowa [caucuses] coming up the first week of August, followed by New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses, and then a caucus, a primary in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

Kamala Harris, whose campaign cut staff in a dramatic restructuring last month, is now polling at just 3 percent, tying her with Michael Bloomberg for fifth place among the Democratic Party’s presidential nominees -- according to a poll released Friday -- even though Bloomberg hasn't even formally announced his 2020 candidacy.

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY, INDEED

“If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 61



TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm.

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""You've got the Iowa [caucuses] coming up the first week of August, followed by New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses, and then a caucus, a primary in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg nine percentage points clear of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., indicating the one-time longshot is now a force to be reckoned with in the race for the Democratic nomination.

The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Buttigieg with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

Warren's support has dropped six percentage points from the September CNN/DMR/Mediacom poll, while Biden's backing has slipped five percentage points. Sanders' support has risen four percentage points from two months ago.

FOX NEWS POLL: CLOSE RACES BETWEEN TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS IN NORTH CAROLINA

No one else in the poll cracked double-digit support. In fifth place, behind Sanders, is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who earned six percent of the vote.

""This @DMRegister poll confirms what we’re seeing every day — MOMENTUM!"" Klobuchar tweeted Saturday night. ""

Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii; businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are all tied at three percent. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not formally announced his candidacy, earned two percent.

Buttigieg has moved to the front of the pack in other recent polls of Iowa. A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday pegged Buttigieg at 22 percent, Biden at 19 percent, Warren at 18 percent and Sanders at 13 percent. Buttigieg's support jumped 14 percentage points compared to Monmouth’s last survey in August, while Biden’s dropped seven percentage points, Warren’s edged down two percentage points, and Sanders jumped five percentage points from the August survey.

A Quinnipiac survey released last week however had Buttigieg one point behind Warren, at 19 and 20 percentage points respectively.

BUTTIGIEG CLAIMS NARROW IOWA LEAD AMID PRIMARY SURGE: POLL

Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Navy war veteran and would be America’s first openly gay president if elected. Without any sort of Washington name-recognition, the mayor’s campaign seemed a longshot before he rose to middle-tier status in the spring.

Buttigieg for many seems to offer a more moderate approach than the radical policy proposals of Warren and Sanders, and unlike Biden, he does not have to fight many concerns about his age or past voting record. Among Iowa caucusgoers, 63 percent say Buttigieg's views are about right, while only seven percent say they are too liberal and 13 percent say they are too conservative.

According to the CNN/DMR poll, Buttigieg excels with caucusgoers with incomes over $100,000 (32 percent) and self-described moderates (also 32 percent) but underperforms with union households (17 percent) and those who call themselves very liberal (12 percent)."

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

The problem – as first reported by The Intercept’s Ryan Grim – was that the image was a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently has nothing to do with the campaign.

LEFT TURNS ON OBAMA AFTER CRITICISM

But Fox News has learned that the photo mix-up was far from an isolated case for the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s White House campaign. Its website has used other stock pictures of black individuals seemingly unaffiliated with the campaign, especially in promoting “the Douglass Plan,” which is billed as an investment in the “empowerment of black America.”

While campaigns have long used generic stills and clips in ads and elsewhere, they sometimes do so at their own peril. And for Buttiegieg – who’s soared to top-tier status in recent weeks, particularly in Iowa, but still struggles with black voters who compose roughly one-fifth of the primary electorate – the dust-up over stock photos falls within a sensitive area for the campaign. It comes as he’s launching a new effort to court black voters with series of events surrounding Wednesday’s Democratic presidential primary debate in Atlanta.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a rival for the Democratic nomination and one of several black candidates in the 2020 race, called it ""a big mistake.""

Speaking at a campaign event in Nevada on Monday, she said: ""He's going to have to answer for that. ... Let's be clear that the Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are, as the diversity of the American people.""

Buttigieg’s proposal – named the Douglass Plan after the abolitionist and activist Frederick Douglass – was rolled out in July. The plan calls for changes to the nation’s health, education and criminal justice systems to combat institutional racism.

The Buttigieg campaign told Fox News that the Kenya photo ""was removed from the page on our website promoting the Douglass Plan months ago as part of a regular update. However, we know we owe an explanation for how it came to be used to begin with. Using stock photos is standard practice across many campaigns.""

""The stock photo in question, which is widely utilized across the Internet, was initially selected while a contractor was running our site, and the website it was pulled from did not indicate the photo was taken in Kenya in any way. As our campaign has grown, we have brought all of our web development in-house to help guard against mistakes like this. We apologize for its use and the confusion it created,"" added Sean Savett, the Buttigieg campaign's rapid response communications director.

While the campaign has mostly taken down the image of the woman kneeling next to a child – replacing it with an image that features Buttigieg – it still appears on an active page that is separate from the website. Further, several additional stock images of minorities have been used by the campaign, including at least one that remained on the main Douglass Plan site until Monday afternoon, when Fox News first flagged it.

The Douglass Plan page had featured a stock photo of a black female student sitting on steps, with text that read: “American needs to create an education system that trains and empowers the next generation of black scientists, artists, writers, college professors, lawyers, tech entrepreneurs, doctors, software engineers, police officers, teachers, and so much more. Yet today, too many children of color are being denied educational justice.”

According to the photo site Pexels, the picture of the student is from the stock photo site “Nappy,” which offers “beautiful, high-res photos of black and brown people. For free.”

The campaign removed the picture on Monday to ""eliminate any confusion,"" after being notified of it by Fox News.

Another stock photo, showing a black child running through a sprinkler, was captioned, “Freedom.” The picture was originally posted on Unsplash.com and published on Aug. 22, 2016. That photo is no longer on the website.

The Douglass Plan section wasn’t the only one to feature stock pictures of minorities. The candidate’s Climate Plan For Latinx and Black Communities has featured an uncaptioned photo of a Hurricane Katrina survivor. According to Getty Images, the black-and-white photo was taken on Oct. 1, 2005, of a Pearlington, Miss., resident who had helped an elderly neighbor escape rising floodwaters. (That photo remains on an active web page affiliated with the campaign, along with the Kenya photo that was removed from the main Douglass Plan page.)

The photo of the woman in Kenya went viral over the weekend, igniting plenty of criticism on social media that there’s a disconnect between Buttigieg’s campaign and minority voters. Grim tweeted that the woman in the photo by Nicholas Githiri reached out to him “very confused.” He said the campaign grabbed the photo from a stock photo service, and the subject “didn’t intend to pose for a stock photo but did agree to be photographed.”

High-profile Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – who is a Somalia-born refugee – criticized Buttigieg for the photo faux pas. “This is not ok or necessary,” she tweeted.

While Buttigieg’s poll numbers are soaring in Iowa and New Hampshire – the two mostly white states that kick off the presidential nominating calendar – surveys indicate the candidate is struggling to connect with black voters. In South Carolina, where a majority of likely Democratic presidential primary voters are African-American, a new Quinnipiac University poll released Monday indicated Buttigieg at less than 1 percent among black voters.

This isn't the first unforced error for Buttigieg when it comes to black voters.

The campaign's still dealing with clean-up after unveiling a large list of some 400 South Carolina Democrats who backed the Douglass Plan. But some of those listed later reportedly said they're supporting other candidates in the Democratic nomination race.

And last month, the campaign removed as a co-host of a Buttigieg fundraiser a Chicago attorney who pushed to block the release of a video showing the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.

McDonald was killed in 2014 by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke. A court-ordered video showed McDonald walking away from the police when he was slain, rather than charging them as the offices had claimed.

“Pete’s campaign is a media-savvy and disciplined campaign; but everything he does from here on out is under a microscope, and with that more pressure for him and his team,"" said veteran Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso.

""He’ll need to be close to perfect between now and the Iowa caucus to keep the media from writing negative stories about his perceived inability to appeal to Latino and African America voters. He has to show he can both win early in the Democratic primary calendar and resonate in diverse communities before Nevada and South Carolina to convert voters who are on the fence to vote for him,"" said Ceraso, a New Hampshire state director for Buttigieg before parting ways this summer.

""Pete’s team doesn’t have the time to react to unforced errors that will distract his campaign team from doing that,"" he added.

But longtime Democratic consultant Bill Burton -- national press secretary for Barack Obama's historic 2008 campaign who later helped steer the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA -- said that ""this distraction is small.""

""I've been on the giving and receiving end of these sort of attacks and they rarely have an impact,"" Burton said.

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO THE TOP IN A NEW IOWA POLL

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Nov. 13 through Sunday, with 768 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.

The Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida poll was conducted Nov. 5-13, with 436 likely Palmetto State state Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.

Steyer was in fourth place - at 8 percent - in the poll - with Harris at 4 percent. Buttigieg stood at 3 percent, and Booker at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less.

South Carolina’s scheduled to hold its primary on Saturday, Feb. 29, following the contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. Three days after South Carolina votes, 14 states hold contests on Super Tuesday."

On the roster: Impeachment probe draws in Trump’s answers to Mueller - Butti-boom, Butti-bing - Trump craps out on gubernatorial gambles - Deep yogurt



IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

The decision by the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman to conduct the first series of interviews behind closed doors allowed Republicans to appropriately brand the enterprise as unfair and clandestine.

His next step, orchestrating a steady stream of leaks and disclosures timed and edited for maximum impact, all but guaranteed that last week’s subsequent live hearings would be anti-climactic.

Schiff stole his own thunder.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARING ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."

The problem – as first reported by The Intercept’s Ryan Grim – was that the image was a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently has nothing to do with the campaign.

LEFT TURNS ON OBAMA AFTER CRITICISM

But Fox News has learned that the photo mix-up was far from an isolated case for the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s White House campaign. Its website has used other stock pictures of black individuals seemingly unaffiliated with the campaign, especially in promoting “the Douglass Plan,” which is billed as an investment in the “empowerment of black America.”

While campaigns have long used generic stills and clips in ads and elsewhere, they sometimes do so at their own peril. And for Buttiegieg – who’s soared to top-tier status in recent weeks, particularly in Iowa, but still struggles with black voters who compose roughly one-fifth of the primary electorate – the dust-up over stock photos falls within a sensitive area for the campaign. It comes as he’s launching a new effort to court black voters with series of events surrounding Wednesday’s Democratic presidential primary debate in Atlanta.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a rival for the Democratic nomination and one of several black candidates in the 2020 race, called it ""a big mistake.""

Speaking at a campaign event in Nevada on Monday, she said: ""He's going to have to answer for that. ... Let's be clear that the Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are, as the diversity of the American people.""

Buttigieg’s proposal – named the Douglass Plan after the abolitionist and activist Frederick Douglass – was rolled out in July. The plan calls for changes to the nation’s health, education and criminal justice systems to combat institutional racism.

The Buttigieg campaign told Fox News that the Kenya photo ""was removed from the page on our website promoting the Douglass Plan months ago as part of a regular update. However, we know we owe an explanation for how it came to be used to begin with. Using stock photos is standard practice across many campaigns.""

""The stock photo in question, which is widely utilized across the Internet, was initially selected while a contractor was running our site, and the website it was pulled from did not indicate the photo was taken in Kenya in any way. As our campaign has grown, we have brought all of our web development in-house to help guard against mistakes like this. We apologize for its use and the confusion it created,"" added Sean Savett, the Buttigieg campaign's rapid response communications director.

While the campaign has mostly taken down the image of the woman kneeling next to a child – replacing it with an image that features Buttigieg – it still appears on an active page that is separate from the website. Further, several additional stock images of minorities have been used by the campaign, including at least one that remained on the main Douglass Plan site until Monday afternoon, when Fox News first flagged it.

The Douglass Plan page had featured a stock photo of a black female student sitting on steps, with text that read: “American needs to create an education system that trains and empowers the next generation of black scientists, artists, writers, college professors, lawyers, tech entrepreneurs, doctors, software engineers, police officers, teachers, and so much more. Yet today, too many children of color are being denied educational justice.”

According to the photo site Pexels, the picture of the student is from the stock photo site “Nappy,” which offers “beautiful, high-res photos of black and brown people. For free.”

The campaign removed the picture on Monday to ""eliminate any confusion,"" after being notified of it by Fox News.

Another stock photo, showing a black child running through a sprinkler, was captioned, “Freedom.” The picture was originally posted on Unsplash.com and published on Aug. 22, 2016. That photo is no longer on the website.

The Douglass Plan section wasn’t the only one to feature stock pictures of minorities. The candidate’s Climate Plan For Latinx and Black Communities has featured an uncaptioned photo of a Hurricane Katrina survivor. According to Getty Images, the black-and-white photo was taken on Oct. 1, 2005, of a Pearlington, Miss., resident who had helped an elderly neighbor escape rising floodwaters. (That photo remains on an active web page affiliated with the campaign, along with the Kenya photo that was removed from the main Douglass Plan page.)

The photo of the woman in Kenya went viral over the weekend, igniting plenty of criticism on social media that there’s a disconnect between Buttigieg’s campaign and minority voters. Grim tweeted that the woman in the photo by Nicholas Githiri reached out to him “very confused.” He said the campaign grabbed the photo from a stock photo service, and the subject “didn’t intend to pose for a stock photo but did agree to be photographed.”

High-profile Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – who is a Somalia-born refugee – criticized Buttigieg for the photo faux pas. “This is not ok or necessary,” she tweeted.

While Buttigieg’s poll numbers are soaring in Iowa and New Hampshire – the two mostly white states that kick off the presidential nominating calendar – surveys indicate the candidate is struggling to connect with black voters. In South Carolina, where a majority of likely Democratic presidential primary voters are African-American, a new Quinnipiac University poll released Monday indicated Buttigieg at less than 1 percent among black voters.

This isn't the first unforced error for Buttigieg when it comes to black voters.

The campaign's still dealing with clean-up after unveiling a large list of some 400 South Carolina Democrats who backed the Douglass Plan. But some of those listed later reportedly said they're supporting other candidates in the Democratic nomination race.

And last month, the campaign removed as a co-host of a Buttigieg fundraiser a Chicago attorney who pushed to block the release of a video showing the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.

McDonald was killed in 2014 by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke. A court-ordered video showed McDonald walking away from the police when he was slain, rather than charging them as the offices had claimed.

“Pete’s campaign is a media-savvy and disciplined campaign; but everything he does from here on out is under a microscope, and with that more pressure for him and his team,"" said veteran Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso.

""He’ll need to be close to perfect between now and the Iowa caucus to keep the media from writing negative stories about his perceived inability to appeal to Latino and African America voters. He has to show he can both win early in the Democratic primary calendar and resonate in diverse communities before Nevada and South Carolina to convert voters who are on the fence to vote for him,"" said Ceraso, a New Hampshire state director for Buttigieg before parting ways this summer.

""Pete’s team doesn’t have the time to react to unforced errors that will distract his campaign team from doing that,"" he added.

But longtime Democratic consultant Bill Burton -- national press secretary for Barack Obama's historic 2008 campaign who later helped steer the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA -- said that ""this distraction is small.""

""I've been on the giving and receiving end of these sort of attacks and they rarely have an impact,"" Burton said.

But two new public opinion surveys in South Carolina – the first Southern state to vote in the race for the White House - shows the former vice president holding a large lead over his rivals for the Democratic nomination.

Biden – he has deep ties to South Carolina -- stands at 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is a distant second – at 13 percent -- with Sanders at 11 percent and Buttigieg at 6 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED SEVERAL STOCK PHOTOS

And Biden stands at 36 percent among likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters in a University of South Florida survey, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at just 10 percent.

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

Among black voters – a majority of Democratic presidential primary voters in South Carolina – Biden stands at 44 percent. Sanders, the Vermont senator, is second at 10 percent, with everyone else registering in single digits.

THE LATEST 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO THE TOP IN A NEW IOWA POLL

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Nov. 13 through Sunday, with 768 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.

The Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida poll was conducted Nov. 5-13, with 436 likely Palmetto State state Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.

Steyer was in fourth place - at 8 percent - in the poll - with Harris at 4 percent. Buttigieg stood at 3 percent, and Booker at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less.

South Carolina’s scheduled to hold its primary on Saturday, Feb. 29, following the contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. Three days after South Carolina votes, 14 states hold contests on Super Tuesday."

On the roster: What would Buttigieg’s path look like? - As impeachment grinds on, voters dig in - Congress kicks can on spending until Dec. 20 - Audible: Audible, indeed - Three wise guys wanted for questioning



WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

AUDIBLE: AUDIBLE, INDEED

“TOTAL EXONERATION!” – Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, tweeted after an interview Monday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” in response to what sounded like him expelling a thunderous toot while on air. The official ‘Hardball’ Twitter account clarified the noise was from someone dragging a coffee mug across a table in the studio.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

So why don't they ditch primaries, too?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-electoral-college-primaries-david-avella,"While South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge in the polls in Iowa, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has consistently shown staying power nationally to remain the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. However, before she declares victory and announces its time to focus on the general election, here is an obvious question for her. If she is so convinced that a national popular vote is how we should elect the president of the United States in the general election, why don't Democrats hold a national primary to select their presidential nominee?

At the core of Warren’s plans for America is the end of the Electoral College. She wants to replace it with a national popular vote.

She is hardly alone among Democrats. Day after day, we are treated to Democrats decrying the Electoral College as being unfair, as being wrong, as being something that gives too much-undeserved power to voters in less populated states.

LIZ PEEK: SCHIFF STEERS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD A DITCH — HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

However, when one examines the arcane and near-mystical process the Democrats have chosen to determine their nominee for president of the United States, one would be hard-pressed to conclude anything other than that Democrats are unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

It would seem to be a pretty simple matter to switch to a national primary where whoever receives the most votes is declared the winner. Why don’t Democrats do that?

One concern could be that with multiple candidates vying for the party’s nomination, one of them could prevail with less than a majority of the votes. That is surely so. Would not that same logic apply to anytime there was a strong third-party candidate?

We did not hear Democrats in 1992, 2000 or any other time arguing that only the votes of the two major-party candidates should count in the presidential tally to ensure the winner has earned a majority of the votes.

In 2016, when Hillary Clinton prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it is pretty clear the Democratic National Committee (DNC) put more than a thumb on the scale to all but assure that she prevailed.

If you go back to the last truly contested race for the Democratic Party nomination, in 2008, the process used might startle you. Suffice it to say, it was a little different than one man, one vote.

Florida and Michigan did not hold their primaries on the days the DNC deemed proper, so their votes were treated in a different fashion than those cast by voters in states bowing to the DNC. They did not even count the popular vote from Michigan (where President Obama did not have his name on the ballot). Eventually, the decision was made to split the delegate vote evenly in these two states, despite Clinton having defeated Obama soundly in Florida where both names were on the ballot.

It gets weirder. Democrats abroad, including those in American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands had delegates who each received a half vote. Would it not just have been easier to have them cut the number of delegates in half?

At the end of the day, if you include the votes cast in Michigan, Hillary Clinton received 48.1 percent and Barack Obama 47.4 percent. Really close.

When delegates selected via primary and caucus were totaled up, neither candidate had enough to win at the convention.

So, just how did the Democrats resolve this tricky and difficult situation? Why, they turned to their consiglieres, otherwise known as super delegates. These are elected officials, party officials, etc.

In other words, an elitist class established to fix problems when the electorate gets out of hand. The super delegates overwhelmingly sided with Obama, and he became the nominee.

Fast forward to 2020. The Democrats are still holding a series of primaries, conventions, and caucuses. Fully 16 percent of the delegates will do nothing more than wake up in the morning and be designated as such. No longer are they called “super delegates.” These folks are now “automatic delegates,” as though they are granted divine intervention powers.

In other words, it’s more of the same old, same old. You do not even hear a murmur that this process should be replaced by a national primary.

The conclusion here is pretty simple. If the Democrats think a straight-up election with a winner-take-all outcome in the general election for president is right and good enough for the nation, they ought to at least demonstrate the pretense of the courage of their convictions and apply that standard to themselves.

Until that day comes to pass, Americans will have to accept that their posturing on the Electoral College is just that… posturing.

The decision by the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman to conduct the first series of interviews behind closed doors allowed Republicans to appropriately brand the enterprise as unfair and clandestine.

His next step, orchestrating a steady stream of leaks and disclosures timed and edited for maximum impact, all but guaranteed that last week’s subsequent live hearings would be anti-climactic.

Schiff stole his own thunder.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARING ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.



THE RULEBOOK: BIG BOSS MAN

“The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 74



TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program. If you can’t handle Tim Alberta for five questions, you darned sure can’t handle the presidency.]

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

On the roster: What would Buttigieg’s path look like? - As impeachment grinds on, voters dig in - Congress kicks can on spending until Dec. 20 - Audible: Audible, indeed - Three wise guys wanted for questioning



WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

AUDIBLE: AUDIBLE, INDEED

“TOTAL EXONERATION!” – Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, tweeted after an interview Monday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” in response to what sounded like him expelling a thunderous toot while on air. The official ‘Hardball’ Twitter account clarified the noise was from someone dragging a coffee mug across a table in the studio.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

“What does a party do when it runs out of ideas? It can only hope that the other guy has even fewer ideas.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Nov. 2, 1990.

So why don't they ditch primaries, too?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-electoral-college-primaries-david-avella,"While South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge in the polls in Iowa, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has consistently shown staying power nationally to remain the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. However, before she declares victory and announces its time to focus on the general election, here is an obvious question for her. If she is so convinced that a national popular vote is how we should elect the president of the United States in the general election, why don't Democrats hold a national primary to select their presidential nominee?

At the core of Warren’s plans for America is the end of the Electoral College. She wants to replace it with a national popular vote.

She is hardly alone among Democrats. Day after day, we are treated to Democrats decrying the Electoral College as being unfair, as being wrong, as being something that gives too much-undeserved power to voters in less populated states.

LIZ PEEK: SCHIFF STEERS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD A DITCH — HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

However, when one examines the arcane and near-mystical process the Democrats have chosen to determine their nominee for president of the United States, one would be hard-pressed to conclude anything other than that Democrats are unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

It would seem to be a pretty simple matter to switch to a national primary where whoever receives the most votes is declared the winner. Why don’t Democrats do that?

One concern could be that with multiple candidates vying for the party’s nomination, one of them could prevail with less than a majority of the votes. That is surely so. Would not that same logic apply to anytime there was a strong third-party candidate?

We did not hear Democrats in 1992, 2000 or any other time arguing that only the votes of the two major-party candidates should count in the presidential tally to ensure the winner has earned a majority of the votes.

In 2016, when Hillary Clinton prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it is pretty clear the Democratic National Committee (DNC) put more than a thumb on the scale to all but assure that she prevailed.

If you go back to the last truly contested race for the Democratic Party nomination, in 2008, the process used might startle you. Suffice it to say, it was a little different than one man, one vote.

Florida and Michigan did not hold their primaries on the days the DNC deemed proper, so their votes were treated in a different fashion than those cast by voters in states bowing to the DNC. They did not even count the popular vote from Michigan (where President Obama did not have his name on the ballot). Eventually, the decision was made to split the delegate vote evenly in these two states, despite Clinton having defeated Obama soundly in Florida where both names were on the ballot.

It gets weirder. Democrats abroad, including those in American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands had delegates who each received a half vote. Would it not just have been easier to have them cut the number of delegates in half?

At the end of the day, if you include the votes cast in Michigan, Hillary Clinton received 48.1 percent and Barack Obama 47.4 percent. Really close.

When delegates selected via primary and caucus were totaled up, neither candidate had enough to win at the convention.

So, just how did the Democrats resolve this tricky and difficult situation? Why, they turned to their consiglieres, otherwise known as super delegates. These are elected officials, party officials, etc.

In other words, an elitist class established to fix problems when the electorate gets out of hand. The super delegates overwhelmingly sided with Obama, and he became the nominee.

Fast forward to 2020. The Democrats are still holding a series of primaries, conventions, and caucuses. Fully 16 percent of the delegates will do nothing more than wake up in the morning and be designated as such. No longer are they called “super delegates.” These folks are now “automatic delegates,” as though they are granted divine intervention powers.

In other words, it’s more of the same old, same old. You do not even hear a murmur that this process should be replaced by a national primary.

The conclusion here is pretty simple. If the Democrats think a straight-up election with a winner-take-all outcome in the general election for president is right and good enough for the nation, they ought to at least demonstrate the pretense of the courage of their convictions and apply that standard to themselves.

Until that day comes to pass, Americans will have to accept that their posturing on the Electoral College is just that… posturing.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the better Democratic candidates for financials and housing, and would be well received by markets if he won the presidential election in 2020, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote Wednesday.

Buttigieg's background likely makes him ""pragmatic,"" and he has surrounded himself with other progressive pragmatists such as Sonal Shah, his national policy adviser who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Google.

Though Buttigieg hasn't shared many views on financials or housing, Seiberg highlights some he has shared.

Read more on Business Insider.

If presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg wins the Democratic nomination and the election in 2020, it would likely be ""well received in the market,"" according to Cowen.

That's because the South Bend, Indiana, mayor is likely the most pragmatic of the leading Democratic candidates, suggesting ""less radical policy swings"" than if a more progressive Democrat won, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a Wednesday note.

""As a mayor, his experience is solving problems rather than partisan brawling,"" Seiberg said. ""That means the door is more open for him to be positive for financials and housing than the other Democrats running for the White House.""

Seiberg does point out that little is known about Buttigieg's views on financial firms or housing, as he doesn't often address them in stump speeches and hasn't been forced to take a stand on them as members of Congress must.

Still, Seiberg argues that Buttigieg's background has left him more pragmatic than ideological. Buttigieg is a self-proclaimed ""Democratic capitalist"" who studied at Harvard and Oxford and worked on economic stabilization in war-torn areas for McKinsey, according to the note.

It also appears that Buttigieg has surrounded himself with other ""progressive pragmatists,"" Seiberg writes, including national policy adviser Sonal Shah. Her resume boasts names such as Goldman Sachs, Google, and the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation at Georgetown University.

In addition, Seiberg writes that Buttigieg would be the candidate most likely to pick a Federal Reserve chairman similar to Janet Yellen, due to his experience in ""dealing with restoring economies.""

Here are some of Buttigieg's known policy views, highlighted by Seiberg:"

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

After the candidates left the stage, progressive author and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson -- who didn't qualify for Wednesday's debate -- tweeted simply, ""Miss me?

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. He understands our immigration problems are being caused by the wrong policies, not by the people who enforce those policies.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

The late entrant into the 2020 Democratic race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick not only didn’t make the debate stage he also canceled an event he organized at Morehouse College in Atlanta, the site of the debate, when only two people showed up."

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.



THE RULEBOOK: BIG BOSS MAN

“The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 74



TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

AUDIBLE: MUY CALIENTE

“The campaigns, of course, are always, shall I say, hot salsa, but the governing part doesn’t need to be that way.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a speech in his home commonwealth of Kentucky decrying the level of vitriol in government.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program. If you can’t handle Tim Alberta for five questions, you darned sure can’t handle the presidency.]

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

Here's what you need to know as you start your Wednesday...

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo. Click here for a complete preview of Wednesday's testimony.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the better Democratic candidates for financials and housing, and would be well received by markets if he won the presidential election in 2020, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote Wednesday.

Buttigieg's background likely makes him ""pragmatic,"" and he has surrounded himself with other progressive pragmatists such as Sonal Shah, his national policy adviser who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Google.

Though Buttigieg hasn't shared many views on financials or housing, Seiberg highlights some he has shared.

Read more on Business Insider.

If presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg wins the Democratic nomination and the election in 2020, it would likely be ""well received in the market,"" according to Cowen.

That's because the South Bend, Indiana, mayor is likely the most pragmatic of the leading Democratic candidates, suggesting ""less radical policy swings"" than if a more progressive Democrat won, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a Wednesday note.

""As a mayor, his experience is solving problems rather than partisan brawling,"" Seiberg said. ""That means the door is more open for him to be positive for financials and housing than the other Democrats running for the White House.""

Seiberg does point out that little is known about Buttigieg's views on financial firms or housing, as he doesn't often address them in stump speeches and hasn't been forced to take a stand on them as members of Congress must.

Still, Seiberg argues that Buttigieg's background has left him more pragmatic than ideological. Buttigieg is a self-proclaimed ""Democratic capitalist"" who studied at Harvard and Oxford and worked on economic stabilization in war-torn areas for McKinsey, according to the note.

It also appears that Buttigieg has surrounded himself with other ""progressive pragmatists,"" Seiberg writes, including national policy adviser Sonal Shah. Her resume boasts names such as Goldman Sachs, Google, and the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation at Georgetown University.

In addition, Seiberg writes that Buttigieg would be the candidate most likely to pick a Federal Reserve chairman similar to Janet Yellen, due to his experience in ""dealing with restoring economies.""

Here are some of Buttigieg's known policy views, highlighted by Seiberg:"

* It looked to me like voters learned quite a bit during last night’s Democratic presidential primary debate.

* In one of the most important polls I’ve seen in a while, the latest Marquette University Law School poll found Donald Trump leading each of the top four Democratic presidential contenders in hypothetical general-election match-ups in Wisconsin, in margins ranging from three to eight points.

* Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign picked up a new congressional endorsement this morning, when the Virgin Islands’ Rep. Stacey Plaskett (D) threw her support behind the California senator. Plaskett is the 11th member of the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Harris.

* For the second time this week, a poll out of Iowa offers good news for Pete Buttigieg: a new Iowa State University poll found the former mayor leading the Democrats’ presidential field with 26%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 19%. Bernie Sanders is a very close third with 18% followed by Joe Biden at 12%.

* In New York, a new Siena College poll found Biden leading Warren among Democratic voters, 24% to 14%, with the former vice president’s support fueled in large part by African-American support. Sanders is a close third with 13% in the poll.

* Google announced changes to its policy on microtargeted advertising yesterday. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Under the new policy, political ads can only be targeted based on users’ age, gender, and location at the postal-code level. Political advertisers will also still be able to display ads based on the content of the page a user is viewing.

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

After the candidates left the stage, progressive author and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson -- who didn't qualify for Wednesday's debate -- tweeted simply, ""Miss me?

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. He understands our immigration problems are being caused by the wrong policies, not by the people who enforce those policies.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

The late entrant into the 2020 Democratic race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick not only didn’t make the debate stage he also canceled an event he organized at Morehouse College in Atlanta, the site of the debate, when only two people showed up."

Why MSNBC’s Democratic debate made no news,https://www.foxnews.com/media/forgotten-why-msnbcs-democratic-debate-made-no-news,"After a nearly 11-hour hearing on impeaching President Trump, MSNBC and the Washington Post hosted a Democratic debate where the leadoff topic was…impeaching President Trump.

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

On the roster: Dems hustle to separate black voters from Biden - Hearings done, House plots next steps on impeachment - Trump says Pompeo may run for Senate - Get your hooves did



DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

“In re: Monday's podcast: you're totally correct about it being too early for Christmas music, and I share your love of good Advent hymns. You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

Why MSNBC’s Democratic debate made no news,https://www.foxnews.com/media/forgotten-why-msnbcs-democratic-debate-made-no-news,"After a nearly 11-hour hearing on impeaching President Trump, MSNBC and the Washington Post hosted a Democratic debate where the leadoff topic was…impeaching President Trump.

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."
76,Andrew Craft,"DAHLONEGA, Ga. -- Democratic presidential hopefuls are calling for the government to spend billions of dollars to increase broadband access in rural America, lamenting the digital divide in ""internet deserts” as they campaign across the country.

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

A few dozen protesters made their way onto the field. Some held signs demanding that Ivy League schools divest from the fossil fuel industry. Others had signs that raised issues of Puerto Rican debt and the treatment of the Uighurs in China.

The incident ended after about an hour when police escorted some of the protesters off the field. A handful of others were arrested.

Police in yellow vests initially lined up alongside the sit-in but did not intervene. When the 15-minute halftime expired and the protest continued, hundreds more fans streamed onto the field to join in. By halftime, Harvard was leading Yale 15-3.

DONALD TRUMP REACTS TO JANE FONDA'S ARRESTS: 'NOTHING CHANGES'

Chants of “Hey Hey! Ho Ho! Fossil fuels have got to go!” were interrupted by the public address announcer imploring the protesters to leave.

“As a courtesy to both teams, the game must resume,” he said.

After about an hour, police formed a line and moved forward, from the Yale sideline toward the Harvard sideline. An agreement was reached to escort the remaining protesters off the field, with one police officer to accompany every two protesters.

Those who did not leave at that point, about one or two dozen, were informed by Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins that they would be arrested.

The protest received support from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has become a leading figure of the progressive movement's climate advocacy.

Others weren't supportive of the protest.

""If we haven’t yet reached peak stupid, then we are assuredly about to cross the event horizon,"" former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino tweeted.

The incident was just the latest in a series of climate demonstrations that erupted in the fall. Protesters held sit-ins in the offices of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, demanding more aggressive action on climate change. Actress Jane Fonda has participated in several protests, including one on Friday that resulted in multiple arrests.

On the roster: Dems hustle to separate black voters from Biden - Hearings done, House plots next steps on impeachment - Trump says Pompeo may run for Senate - Get your hooves did



DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

“In re: Monday's podcast: you're totally correct about it being too early for Christmas music, and I share your love of good Advent hymns. You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

Once private insurance companies were eliminated there would be nothing to stop the federal government from raising premiums and taxes and cutting insurance benefits. And we, the American people, would have nowhere else to turn to get needed health insurance.

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes.

They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there.

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

Once private insurance companies were eliminated there would be nothing to stop the federal government from raising premiums and taxes and cutting insurance benefits. And we, the American people, would have nowhere else to turn to get needed health insurance.

On the roster: Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden knotted in N.H. - Detroit Democrat does impeachment flip-flop-flip - Audible: How it’s done - The car that caught the dog



BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”



Bloomy’s low-key, high-dollar launch - NYT: “Michael R. Bloomberg started his campaign at a hushed diner in downtown Norfolk, Va. … before strolling to a nearby hotel ballroom and making an efficient statement before a bank of television cameras. Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

AUDIBLE: HOW IT’S DONE

“Chris Wallace is a damn good reporter. He asked me a very direct question. He asked me about hacking the DNC computer. I heard him say I thought he'd said meddling in the election. Chris was right. I was wrong. So let me be clear. Russia hacked the DNC computer. I have no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine did it.” – Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

“The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62



TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: Did you ever hear the one about the blind men trying to describe an elephant? One said it was a snake, one said it was a rope, one said it was the trunk of a tree. It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”

Telling the truth,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ben-shapiro-pete-buttigiegs-big-mistake-telling-the-truth,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Buttigieg's early candidacy gained credibility thanks to the moderation he displayed compared with other Democrats. He quickly lost steam when he tacked to the left.

Now Buttigieg has swiveled back toward the center, launching a series of assaults on the radical plans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and stealing her momentum in the largely white early primary states.

LIZ PEEK: BLOOMBERG RUN COULD HURT WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG — BUT MAYOR WOULD FACE UPHILL BATTLE

Normally, such political rises are attended by a spate of negative reactionary coverage, and Buttigieg's story is no different. The most effective attack on Buttigieg has centered around his complete lack of black support -- a crucial problem for a candidate whose party sees black voters as a near supermajority of primary voters in states like South Carolina.

Some of those attacks have focused on Buttigieg's less-than-stellar governance in South Bend, where crime rates have remained critically high and relations between the local population and police have been strained throughout his tenure.

But the latest attack is on Buttigieg's entire political mentality. This week, an article from Michael Harriot at The Root, titled ""Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF,"" trended on Twitter. What, exactly, was Buttigieg's lie? He suggested back in 2011 that not all educational outcome disparities between blacks and whites are attributable to systemic racism.

""The kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,"" Buttigieg stated (""whitely,"" in Harriot's adjective). ""You're motivated because you believe that at the end of your educational process, there is a reward; there's a stable life; there's a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially the lower-income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.""

According to Harriot, this statement makes Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----."" Why? Because majority-minority schools are underfunded compared with majority-white schools; because black students are ""disciplined more harshly than white students,"" as Harriot says; because black college graduates don't have as successful an employment record as white college graduates.

""Get-along moderates would rather make s--- up out of whole cloth than wade into the waters of reality,"" Harriot wrote. ""Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.""

But none of these three factors should explain the bulk of racial educational disparities. The black dropout rate from high school is far higher than that of white students, which has nothing to do with underfunded schools.

Black students, by best available data, misbehave in school more often than white students. Black students drop out of college far more often than white students, which has nothing to do with institutional discrimination. Adjusting for household income, black women actually overperform white women in terms of college attendance and income. Something else is going on.

What is going on? According to a 2018 study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, young black men do best in areas with high levels of fatherhood. Lack of school mobility, largely due to entrenched interests preventing such mobility, doesn't help either.

Harvard's Roland Fryer formalized ""a particular peer effect, 'acting white,' which potentially contributes to the ongoing puzzle of black underachievement.""

Former President Obama similarly suggested an ""element of truth"" in the accusation that education is undervalued in many black homes, lamenting the attitude ""OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly?"" A study from the Brookings Institution found that black students spend less time on homework than other racial groups -- by a long shot.

So, is Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----"" for pointing out that not all disparities can be attributed to institutional discrimination? Of course not. But in the Democratic Party, such common sense represents political suicide.

""Is this just a reminder that this does exist in the world? That's why people like Colin Kaepernick are kneeling, that's why people are protesting, that's why Black Lives Matter came out,"" she said.

Behar responded by arguing that ""systemic racism is with you whether you have a role model or not."" She added that former President Obama provided the ""greatest role model"" for black children and all Americans.

Co-host Sunny Hostin said race is one of Buttigieg's ""blind spots"" that hinders his campaign. She went on to praise Root writer Michael Harriot who blasted Buttigieg's comments in an article titled, ""Pete Buttigieg is a Lying MF.""

""He's a wonderful writer, he's extremely thoughtful,"" Hostin said. During the piece, Harriot drops a slew of profanities, including when he calls Buttigieg a ""lucky m**********r.""

Hostin added that she was surprised Buttigieg didn't ""know better"" than to make those comments in 2011. His claim about role models was factually incorrect, too, Hostin argued.

According to Harriot, Buttigieg called him and said, “I don’t think I’ve ever been called a ‘lying m----------r’ before.”

The two discussed his role model comments.

""For 18 minutes and 45 seconds, we talked about educational inequality, poverty and institutional racism in America and how to fix it. OK...I’m lying,"" Harriot said."

On the roster: Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden knotted in N.H. - Detroit Democrat does impeachment flip-flop-flip - Audible: How it’s done - The car that caught the dog



BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”



Bloomy’s low-key, high-dollar launch - NYT: “Michael R. Bloomberg started his campaign at a hushed diner in downtown Norfolk, Va. … before strolling to a nearby hotel ballroom and making an efficient statement before a bank of television cameras. Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!



TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me?

Telling the truth,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ben-shapiro-pete-buttigiegs-big-mistake-telling-the-truth,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Buttigieg's early candidacy gained credibility thanks to the moderation he displayed compared with other Democrats. He quickly lost steam when he tacked to the left.

Now Buttigieg has swiveled back toward the center, launching a series of assaults on the radical plans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and stealing her momentum in the largely white early primary states.

LIZ PEEK: BLOOMBERG RUN COULD HURT WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG — BUT MAYOR WOULD FACE UPHILL BATTLE

Normally, such political rises are attended by a spate of negative reactionary coverage, and Buttigieg's story is no different. The most effective attack on Buttigieg has centered around his complete lack of black support -- a crucial problem for a candidate whose party sees black voters as a near supermajority of primary voters in states like South Carolina.

Some of those attacks have focused on Buttigieg's less-than-stellar governance in South Bend, where crime rates have remained critically high and relations between the local population and police have been strained throughout his tenure.

But the latest attack is on Buttigieg's entire political mentality. This week, an article from Michael Harriot at The Root, titled ""Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF,"" trended on Twitter. What, exactly, was Buttigieg's lie? He suggested back in 2011 that not all educational outcome disparities between blacks and whites are attributable to systemic racism.

""The kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,"" Buttigieg stated (""whitely,"" in Harriot's adjective). ""You're motivated because you believe that at the end of your educational process, there is a reward; there's a stable life; there's a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially the lower-income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.""

According to Harriot, this statement makes Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----."" Why? Because majority-minority schools are underfunded compared with majority-white schools; because black students are ""disciplined more harshly than white students,"" as Harriot says; because black college graduates don't have as successful an employment record as white college graduates.

""Get-along moderates would rather make s--- up out of whole cloth than wade into the waters of reality,"" Harriot wrote. ""Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.""

But none of these three factors should explain the bulk of racial educational disparities. The black dropout rate from high school is far higher than that of white students, which has nothing to do with underfunded schools.

Black students, by best available data, misbehave in school more often than white students. Black students drop out of college far more often than white students, which has nothing to do with institutional discrimination. Adjusting for household income, black women actually overperform white women in terms of college attendance and income. Something else is going on.

What is going on? According to a 2018 study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, young black men do best in areas with high levels of fatherhood. Lack of school mobility, largely due to entrenched interests preventing such mobility, doesn't help either.

Harvard's Roland Fryer formalized ""a particular peer effect, 'acting white,' which potentially contributes to the ongoing puzzle of black underachievement.""

Former President Obama similarly suggested an ""element of truth"" in the accusation that education is undervalued in many black homes, lamenting the attitude ""OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly?"" A study from the Brookings Institution found that black students spend less time on homework than other racial groups -- by a long shot.

So, is Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----"" for pointing out that not all disparities can be attributed to institutional discrimination? Of course not. But in the Democratic Party, such common sense represents political suicide.

""And a lot of kids -- especially the lower income, minority neighborhoods -- who literally just haven't seen it work.

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg indicated that Buttigieg's comments were another indication that racism still existed.

""Is this just a reminder that this does exist in the world? That's why people like Colin Kaepernick are kneeling, that's why people are protesting, that's why Black Lives Matter came out,"" she said.

Behar responded by arguing that ""systemic racism is with you whether you have a role model or not."" She added that former President Obama provided the ""greatest role model"" for black children and all Americans.

Co-host Sunny Hostin said race is one of Buttigieg's ""blind spots"" that hinders his campaign. She went on to praise Root writer Michael Harriot who blasted Buttigieg's comments in an article titled, ""Pete Buttigieg is a Lying MF.""

""He's a wonderful writer, he's extremely thoughtful,"" Hostin said. During the piece, Harriot drops a slew of profanities, including when he calls Buttigieg a ""lucky m**********r.""

Hostin added that she was surprised Buttigieg didn't ""know better"" than to make those comments in 2011. His claim about role models was factually incorrect, too, Hostin argued.

According to Harriot, Buttigieg called him and said, “I don’t think I’ve ever been called a ‘lying m----------r’ before.”

The two discussed his role model comments.

""For 18 minutes and 45 seconds, we talked about educational inequality, poverty and institutional racism in America and how to fix it. OK...I’m lying,"" Harriot said."

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!



TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

AUDIBLE: THE LEFTOVERS ARE THE BEST

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me?

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly,” Kelly Mehlenbacher, then the state operations director for Harris’ campaign, said in the letter obtained by The New York Times. “While I still believe that Senator Harris is the strongest candidate to win in the General Election in 2020, I no longer have confidence in our campaign or its leadership.”

HARRIS AIDES BELIEVE GABBARD ATTACKS ACCELERATED 2020 WOES: REPORT

She went on to criticize the campaign in blistering terms for pushing staffers to move to Baltimore, only to let them go without notice.

“It is not acceptable to me that we encouraged people to move from Washington, DC to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice, with no plan for the campaign, and without thoughtful consideration of the personal consequences to them or the consequences that their absence would have on the remaining staff,” the letter says.

Mehlenbacher has since joined former New York City Michael Bloomberg's campaign, joining as deputy chief operating officer. She had previously worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.

The letter forms part of an in-depth report, featuring interviews with dozens of current and former aides, by the Times. The article marks how Harris, once surging at the top of the polls, has since plummeted amid a reportedly dysfunctional and often headless campaign.

BLOOMBERG PILFERS TOP HARRIS CAMPAIGN AIDE

The article points to a campaign that has not been able to afford TV advertising and has struggled to handle attacks from other Democrats, such as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez issued a statement to the Times.

""Our team, from the candidate to organizers across the country, are working day in and out to make sure Kamala is the nominee to take on Donald Trump and end the national nightmare that is his presidency,” he said. “Just like every campaign, we have made tough decisions to have the resources we need to place in Iowa and springboard into the rest of the primary calendar.”

According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the nomination, Harris was in second place in early July, commanding an average of 15 percent of primary voters. But since then, she has declined quickly.

Now, RCP polls have her with an average of just under 4 percent — far behind candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden (27 percent), Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (18.3 percent), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (15.8 percent), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (11 percent)."

It was the most direct response to -- and an embrace of -- an attack launched by Biden in a Medium post on Tuesday in which he assailed the senator, without naming names, over her suggestion that his arguments against ""Medicare for All"" sounded like they were coming from a candidate ""running in the wrong presidential primary.""

In her response, Warren also made explicit what many of her supporters have suggested in recent days: that recent criticisms lodged against her by rivals like Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have a sexist edge to them.

Both have singled out Warren for taking a ""my way or the highway"" approach to her campaign. On Tuesday, Biden wrote that Warren's remarks accusing him of employing ""Republican talking points"" against Medicare for All suggested a more damning analysis.

""These kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,"" the former vice president wrote, before describing Warren's ""approach to politics"" as ""condescending"" and elitist.

The word that jumped off the screen to many Democrats -- and a lot of women: ""angry."" Almost immediately, a series of writers and pundits zeroed in on and denounced the phrasing as sexist -- which, to many observers of her campaign, seemed odd, if not plainly misleading.

""This is not an endorsement of Elizabeth Warren the candidate, but an affirmation of who I know her to be. Anyone falsely casting her as angry & antagonistic is telegraphing the limits of their minds, & the magnitude of their insecurities,"" wrote journalist Connie Schultz , who is the wife of Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

'That has nothing to do with it'

In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Friday, after Warren's email landed, Biden denied that he had characterized his rival for the nomination as angry because of her gender.

""The strong women in my life are angry -- they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,"" he said.

Criticizing her in terms used to denigrate women, Biden added, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""It had nothing to do with that,"" the former vice president said. ""It had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.""

The Biden campaign's view -- and those of his close allies, men and women -- is that Warren threw the first punch, during the health care dust-up, and he is merely answering her remarks.

Warren's initial comment about running in the ""wrong presidential primary"" was ""absurd, because Joe Biden has served this country honorably -- he's been a Democrat his entire life,"" said senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders, baking in an implicit jab at Warren's decision, in 1996, to switch her registration from Republican to Democrat.

""This has been and is about health care, and we want to be able to have a high-level policy conversation,"" Sanders said. ""And as Democrats, we should be able to disagree without asserting that someone doesn't know what they're talking about or should be kicked out of the party or is corrupt.""

The Warren campaign, which has made it a practice from the starting line not to swat at every provocation, opted against putting out a direct reply to Biden's initial criticism. Instead, her team amplified some of the ambient online criticism and appeared poised, at least until Friday afternoon, to leave it at that.

Despite the more forward wording, Warren's email offered a different flavor of the same message she regularly delivers to supporters on the campaign trail. Lines in the email detailing her anger ""on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump's government, our rigged economy, and business as usual,"" were nearly indistinguishable from her stump speech.

Her frustration, Warren has said throughout the campaign, does not hold some distorting grip on her politics.

""I don't propose a wealth tax because I'm cranky,"" she said during a rally in Seattle this summer, a line she often repeats now on the stump, sometimes smiling broadly for effect. ""I don't propose it because I'm mad at anybody.""

This is the narrow line Warren has been made to walk throughout the campaign. Polling over the course of the past 10 months suggests she has successfully charted the path. Warren tops a number of early-state polls and is regularly found to be among the leaders when voters are asked to name their second-choice candidates.

'A smarty britches'

Still, the prospect of a Warren presidency has provoked anxiety and attacks from those opposed to her politics, and, quite literally, brought at least one grown man to the brink of tears.

""I don't need Elizabeth Warren, or the government, giving away my money,"" billionaire former hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman told CNBC earlier this week, his eyes watering, when the conversation turned to Warren's signature wealth tax.

Cooperman is one in a growing crowd of powerful men -- including some campaign rivals -- to paint Warren, who has campaigned on a populist promise to tax the rich in order to fund an ambitious suite of social programs, as angry or vindictive.

Asked this week if he would ever discuss tax policy with Warren, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: ""I'm not sure how open-minded she is ... or that she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.""

Before he bowed out of the race, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas suggested that Warren ""is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other"" than ""lifting people up.""

A source close to Biden's campaign described the new tone of attacks on Warren coming from him and his team as intentional in a different way: to communicate the message that ""Warren is a smarty britches who thinks if you don't agree with her, you're an idiot.""

Faced with accusations, amplified on social media by Warren's campaign during the week, over what some saw as sexist attacks, Biden's campaign also pointed to examples of him using the same words and phrases to criticize men -- including the time he called John McCain an ""angry man"" and ""a little more angry than he usually is"" in 2008, before labeling Mitt Romney an ""elitist"" in 2012.

Carol Moseley Braun, a Biden-supporting former senator from Illinois, said she's known the former vice president since the 1990s and has seen ""nothing, zero, zippo, to suggest this man has got a sexist bone in his body. I just haven't.""

""I don't think it's so much gendered criticism as it is a stupid argument, and you can quote me on that,"" she said. ""It's a silly argument, as far as I'm concerned. The fact is that Sen. Warren is entitled to her position, VP Biden is entitled to his position and they're not going to be the same position -- they're different candidates.""

She also alluded to Biden's implicit digs at Warren for being a registered Republican until the 1990s.

""To have somebody that just came around beating up on (Biden), to me, is just insulting,"" she said.

Biden's campaign also needled the Warren campaign for its response to his comments -- which during the week largely came through retweeting women and progressive activists who were critical.

""Donald Trump has already tried to extort a foreign country into intervening in this election, and we fought back. In his attempts to get reelected, no dirty trick will be off limits and no stone left unturned,"" said spokesman Andrew Bates. ""Anyone who thinks they will be able to simply subtweet their way to victory against Donald Trump is flat-out wrong."""

“As a candidate for president, the best thing that could happen is to defeat not just Trump, but Trumpism,” Buttigieg said in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo on Thursday.

The South Bend mayor said he was encouraged by Republicans he met who are “furious” with what President Trump is doing in office.

He urged Americans to give “such a thumping in November 2020 against Trumpism and everything associated with it that it creates the shockwaves required to reunite Republicans in elected office with their conscience or lead to the dissolution and reinvention of that party.”

In 2018, Time magazine posited that President Trump had created a political revolution of economic populism that would outlast Trump’s presidency.

The president shared a GIF of the cover on Twitter, joking that he will remain in office after his second term:

Cuomo asserted that Buttigieg is too young and “too nice” to beat Trump, prompting the mayor to talk tough.

“I believe in kindness, but no one should mistake my kindness for weakness,” he said.

Buttigieg expressed confidence that his experience as a mayor would show Americans his leadership abilities, emphasizing his military service and his roots in the Midwest.

“I live in a middle-class neighborhood in the Midwest and drive a Chevy. I don’t helicopter around to golf courses with my name on it,” he said.

Buttigieg added that he could not respect Trump as the President of the United States, saying:

He has done nothing to command my respect, I’ll say that, because he doesn’t respect his own presidency. And, frankly, at a deeper level, I don’t think he respects himself. I think he has created a sort of cartoon character, which is fine if you are a reality TV star where you’re playing a part, even when the part is yourself. When you are President of the United States, lives depend on your integrity, on your wisdom, on your judgement, and I just don’t see it in this White House.

When Cuomo remarked that he was “jealous” of the young South Bend mayor for not having a single grey hair on his head, Buttigieg replied, “Every time I open Twitter, I get a new gray hair.”"

Those of you looking for even more proof that the establishment media have almost no impact on public opinion need only read on…

Keep in mind that this a poll of 835 registered voters taken between October 30 and November 2, 2019 — or while Democrats and their media allies are on a 24/7 crusade to impeach Trump.

Favorable / Unfavorable Donald Trump: 44 / 54 percent Quid Pro Joe Biden: 43 / 50 percent Bernie “The Fossil” Sanders: 41 / 54 percent Cherokee Princess Elizabeth Warren: 42 / 44 percent Dingbat Kamala Harris: 27 / 46 percent Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg: 27 / 34 percent

If that is not interesting enough for you, since this poll was taken in late September, Trump’s numbers have improved… Previously, he was at 43 percent favorable, 56 percent unfavorable.

And guess whose numbers got worse, and I mean a whole lot worse… Yep, Slow Joe Biden’s… Which, once again, proves that the Ukrainian torpedoes aimed at the Bad Orange Man went off course and nailed Old Joe.

In September, before we learned how Joe and his son Hunter looted at least two foreign countries, Joe sat at 46 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable. That’s a loss of eight net points while Trump gained three points.

Granted, Trump is more upside-down than Biden, but only by three points (10 to 7), which is well within the margin of error. Buttigieg is also upside down by seven points, while Bernie is buried by 13 points and Kamala by 19 points — which is an accurate reflection of just how awful she is.

One warning sign for Trump is that only 42 percent of those polled believe he deserves reelection, while 55 percent do not want him reelected. But even on this point, since September, Trump has improved from a 39 to 57 percent response. So he has been gaining ground … during impeachment!

But here’s the other thing…

Even if 55 percent of the country wants Trump replaced in 2020, they have to replace him with someone else. There has to be an acceptable alternative, and what we have here is a Democrat field so weak, so extreme and unappealing, Big Guns like Michael Bloomberg and Eric Holder are seriously considering jumping in at this very late date.

As far as impeachment, despite 24/7 negative news coverage and selective leaks, this pig just isn’t going to fly.

“It’s important not to read too much into differences within the margin of error. But the fact that there is no significant change in the current results suggests that the opening salvo of the House impeachment inquiry has had little impact on the overall 2020 dynamic. Voter opinion remains baked in,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

Ya think?

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Trump currently enjoys a relatively healthy job approval rating of 44 percent, and the polls gauging impeachment have either stalled or are losing altitude. Monmouth has Trump’s job approval at 45 percent.

Most telling, at least in my opinion, is that impeachment has not boosted the cable news ratings. Far-left CNN is actually attracting fewer viewers when compared to last year. This shows an extraordinary amount of voter indifference towards impeachment. Americans just don’t see impeachment as a big deal, as anything more than just another partisan food fight.

If voters believed there was an actual crime here, cable news ratings would be through the roof, and Trump’s favorability, reelect, and job approval ratings would not be on the upswing.

Bottom line: this is the media fail of all media fails.

Earlier this year, Bloomberg backed away from a presidential run after clashing with left-wing Democrats. He said that while he could defeat President Donald Trump, he had doubts about the primary: “I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,” he wrote.

At the time, Bloomberg went further, arguing that “until 2021, and possibly longer, our only real hope for progress lies outside of Washington.” He pledged to continue to devote himself to cherished causes, such as gun control and climate change (which he has pursued by literally paying the salaries of state prosecutors around the country). The mayor who tried to ban large sodas and claims China’s Xi Jinping is “not a dictator” was bearish about his chances.

Left unsaid at the time was the fact that former Vice President Joe Biden had entered the race, making it harder for Bloomberg and other so-called “moderates” to join. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who had also toyed with an independent run for president, likewise deferred and then declined to run.

Biden, though nearing 80, was the heir apparent to Obama’s donors, if not his endorsement. The party establishment realized it had to stay united to win.

But then Biden began to falter — first in the debates, where he was embarrassed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for his collegiality with former segregationists, and then in the polls.

While still nominally the nationwide frontrunner , Biden has lost ground to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). In a recent Iowa poll, Biden was in fourth place — even losing to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has surged to second there.

Moreover, Biden has also lost the battle for the soul of the party. Radical socialist policies have become the default among Democrat activists. Both Warren and Sanders back “Medicare for All,” a government takeover of health care that would cost $52 trillion under Warren’s plan. She denies that her plan would impose new taxes on middle class families, but Sanders, whose plan has been costed at a mere $32 trillion, openly and proudly admits that it would.

In January, when “Medicare for All” moved to the fore — thanks in part to the efforts of newly-elected “democratic socialist” Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) — Bloomberg told New Hampshire voters frankly: “You could never afford that, you’re talking about trillions of dollars.” He also embraced a version of Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal” — but one that he said would be “achievable,” in contrast to her plan to kill the fossil fuel industry.

Bloomberg was incredulous at Democrats’ other policies. He blasted Warren’s “wealth tax” on billionaires such as himself: “If you want to look at a system that’s non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death — it’s called Venezuela,” he said. And: “I’m a little bit tired of listening to things that are pie in the sky, that we never are going to pass or never are going to afford.”

It was Joe Biden’s job to stop all of that, and appeal to Democrats in the “battleground states” who prefer a moderate candidate. But he failed, and none of the other candidates seem to be electable.

That is why Democrats have chosen impeachment: they do not believe their candidates can win.

And it is why Bloomberg is thinking of jumping in — in Alabama, of all places. He like much of America, is voting “no confidence” in the Democratic presidential field.

1. Hong Kong

Protests in Hong Kong have been escalating for five months now, and several serious incidents this weekend may mark a new boiling point. A traffic police officer shot a 21-year-old protester in the torso, sparking renewed outrage and violence . (Police say the protester is expected to survive.) Hours after the shooting, a man who confronted a group of pro-democracy protesters was doused in a flammable liquid and set alight. Amid the violence, a police officer appeared to drive his motorcycle into a crowd and has been suspended by the force. All of this escalating unrest follows the death of a 22-year-old student on Friday, who passed away after falling from a parking garage during a demonstration. The surge in violence has taken a toll on the economy: Hong Kong stocks suffered their worst day in more than three months on Monday.

2. Impeachment Inquiry

Could this be the biggest week yet for the House impeachment investigation ? Those closed-door testimonies are about to become public, and Democrats will trot out a stable of career State Department employees who will testify under oath to things they've already talked about in private. On the docket: Bill Taylor, still the top State Department official in Ukraine; US Diplomat George Kent; and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Not scheduled to appear: The unknown whistleblower whose alarm uncovered Trump's alleged effort to use financial aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to further his own political interests. Republican leaders like Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham want the whistleblower to come forward and testify . House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says the whistleblower's claims have been corroborated, so an appearance would be redundant.

Bolivian President Evo Morales and Vice President Álvaro García Linera resigned yesterday amid growing outrage after an international audit found the results of last month's general election could not be validated because of ""serious irregularities."" The October elections sparked protests across the country. Thousands of demonstrators accused electoral authorities of manipulating the vote count in favor of Morales, the country's longtime socialist leader who was seeking his fourth term. Now that Morales is out, even more uncertainty is coming down the road as Bolivians must go back to the polls for a new general election. Morales was president for 14 years, and there isn't a clear successor to his administration.

Winter is DEFINITELY here. The US is in for a record-breaking Arctic blast this week that could cause temperatures in some part of the country to plummet to 30 degrees below average. The National Weather Service predicts that more than 200 record lows could be tied or set from Monday to Wednesday. The Great Plains area will probably get hit first, and then the cold will move east over the week. Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Ohio Valley may see record lows on Tuesday, and the Deep South and the Gulf Coast will feel the freeze on Wednesday. Keep those mittens handy for a while, though -- the cold may not let up for five to seven days.

Some vicarious morning traffic stress"
109,"Dana Bash and Bridget Nolan, CNN","Tune in tonight at 9 p.m. ET for a CNN presidential town hall in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden, moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett.

It's not that he couldn't move faster, it's that he clearly didn't want to. Stopping and talking to people, especially young people there to greet him, is the essence of Biden. Aides joke that it often takes him longer than scheduled for him to get to events because he talks to everyone.

That was vividly on display here, where he was taking part in a Granite State rite of passage: filing for the first-in-the-nation primary here in person. Spending the day with Biden, as CNN did on Friday, was to watch him on the front lines of an increasingly heated two-front war as he seeks his party's presidential nomination in 2020: against his Democratic rivals and also President Donald Trump

Biden continues to face attacks from Trump and his allies over his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. And the former vice president is engaged in an increasingly ugly back and forth with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over health care policy.

When asked if Trump's relentless attacks are helping, without hesitation, he said yes.

""They're helping me in every way,"" Biden tells us, arguing the basics: Democratic voters see that the President considers him a threat.

Biden also suggested that he doesn't want to fight with Warren but feels he has no choice after she suggested his arguments against her plan to fund ""Medicare for All"" meant he was running in the wrong presidential primary. He responded by calling her approach elitist , writing that they ""reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics."" On Friday, in an email to supporters, Warren embraced the angry label, writing, ""I am angry and I own it,"" and said women have been told ""over and over"" that they are not allowed to be angry.

Biden told us attacking Warren, using a term some see as sexist, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""I was responding to a comment she made,"" Biden said. ""She said that anyone who disagreed with her and took her on, on her issue of Medicare for All, somehow either was a coward, wasn't willing to stand up and state what they thought. Somehow doing something -- I think the phrase was should be in a Republican primary. When we talk about Medicare for All, people talk about taking two years, five years, 10 years to get it done. That doesn't give any real reassurance to people out there,"" he explained.

When asked directly whether somebody who supports Medicare for All, a sweeping liberal proposal that would create a national health care system, can beat Donald Trump, Biden demurred.

""I'm not going to make that judgment,"" he told CNN.

Biden's sharpened attacks on Warren comes as a recent Monmouth University poll shows Warren catching Biden at the top of the field among Democrats nationally. She has also placed in the top tier in the most recent surveys of likely Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, while Biden has fallen behind the pack in some early state polls.

The rough reality for Biden, one his campaign started setting expectations about months ago, is that despite being a front-runner, he's not there alone and he very well could lose Iowa and New Hampshire.

If that happened, would his candidacy survive?

""I think I'm going to do better in both places than that,"" Biden insisted.

Pushed again on what would happen, Biden replied: ""Not going to go there,"" he replied.

On the trail

For Biden, being greeted here in New Hampshire by throngs of people holding campaign signs and beating drums (props born out of one of Biden's greatest hits lines -- that he will beat Trump ""like a drum"") was a chance to show passion behind a candidacy that leans hard into the practical.

""Eight years of Donald Trump will forever and fundamentally change the character of this country, and that's why I am running,"" Biden declared at a rally outside on a blustery cold day.

Other candidates, especially his fellow leading contenders like Warren and Bernie Sanders, are selling a wholesale change in approach to governance. Biden is not. He is all about getting Trump out of the White House and says he's the best to do it.

Still, in an interview inside the State House gift shop, he insisted that his candidacy is about more than a pragmatic promise to beat Trump.

""You feel passion for your campaign?"" we asked.

""I do, sure I do. Or I wouldn't be, look, the only reason I'm doing this is because we cannot, we cannot continue down the road of dividing this nation and walking away from the rest of the world,"" he replied, ticking off reasons he said the President has hurt America globally.

It's an understandable approach. Talking to voters who came to see him, many said flatly that the main reason they're considering supporting Biden is because he has the best chance of defeating the President, which anecdotally here, just as in polls of Democratic voters, matters more than anything to them in 2020.

On the stump, Biden's campaign clearly tries to weave in reminders of his experience, with opportunities to show how he has grown.

At a roundtable to discuss the Violence Against Women Act, which he helped write in the Senate, Biden goes deep into the history of how hard it was to convince his male colleagues to make changes that are taken for granted in 2019, like making it illegal for a man to rape his wife.

To show he has a grasp on modern day issues, he reminded the audience that men -- especially trans men -- are frequent victims of violence.

Events like this also allow for Biden to do what Biden does best: emote and empathize. After the event was over and the microphones turned off, he stayed in his seat talking intensely to a woman who told her own story of being a victim of violence.

Later, at a town hall in Franklin, New Hampshire, two of the questioners were children. One about climate change, and another about gun violence.

""How are you going to make schools more safe from mass shootings?"" asked a 10-year-old boy who said his name was Jordan.

""Think about this. Those of you over 30. Could you ever imagine having asked that question?"" responded with a question of his own from the audience.

""You talk about the soul of America. It's a sick soul we have when in fact we send our kids into school these days that duck and cover."" he added.

Third time a charm?

The first time Biden ran for president was 1987. The world has changed a lot since then, and -- riding with him to an event -- he insists he has changed with it. This is Biden's third time running for president, which he admitted is tricky.

""The good news is the bad news. Everybody knows me. Everybody has an opinion. So it's harder to mislabel me or to say something about me that's not true. I have weaknesses. It's easier to talk about the weaknesses, but the generic point is that people know who I am,"" he said.

Familiarity and comfort drew voters we talked to see him, even though some said they're are not sold yet.

Ruth Kovacs and Terri Arangio were at the State House to see Biden wearing his campaign stickers and holding his signs.

But they told us they're still actively candidate shopping.

""Not 100%"" Kovacs said about her support for Biden. ""Personally, I like the middle of the roaders, not far left. I like Amy [Klobuchar], Pete Buttigieg and of course Joe Biden.""

""I've always loved Joe Biden,"" added Arangio.

""He's a likable guy, he says what it is, sometimes he has his gaffes, but I think that's what makes Joe Joe.""

We met several voters who said they came to see Biden in person, a privilege that Granite State voters hold dear, in order to see for themselves if the 76-year-old former vice president seems too old to be president.

Eric Swendsen came to the Franklin town hall with concerns about Biden's age, but told us he felt better after seeing him in action.

""I think he'll be fine. I think he'll be just fine,"" Swendsen said in his post-town hall assessment.

It is a topic we discussed with Biden during our car ride -- that anecdotally older voters who are his age tell us they can't imagine having the stamina to be president.

""What I tell them is, 'Watch me.' Oh God. The one thing that I've learned is, hopefully that age comes with experience, with experience comes with adjustment, and with adjustment comes some wisdom."""

“New Hampshire has mountains. Iowa has plains. They couldn’t be more different except for the results of the last two Quinnipiac University polls, which both show 4 candidates in the top tier,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy stated, warning that the state’s lineup is “far from rock solid.”

“Although Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it’s far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs,” Malloy added.

Quinnipiac also asked 636 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters if they would support Michael Bloomberg. Only two percent signaled they would “definitely” support him, while 37 percent said they “would consider voting for him.” The majority, 54 percent, said they “definitely would not vote for him.” The margin of error for that question is +/- 5 percent.

“If he truly is in, there is a lot of work to do. But with vast resources to draw from, Michael Bloomberg’s nascent campaign could morph from ‘under construction’ to ‘full steam ahead’ in a New York minute,” Malloy said."

If you want to run for president, it is a 50 state process that requires filing papers and whatever else is required to get on the ballot. Alabama’s filing deadline passed last week. New Hampshire and Arkansas expire this week. The heavy hitters of Illinois, California, and Texas are just weeks away. Ohio and North Carolina arrive before Christmas.

In other words, unless someone gets off the pot, the current 2020 crop of tired, old extremists is locked in forever. Which means one of them will face Trump in 2020, and a quick look around shows that Democrats are not happy about that.

There are rumblings about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg seriously considering taking the plunge. There’s even talk about former Attorney General Eric Holder. And because she’s a vampire who keeps coming back in terrible sequels, there’s Hillary.

No one knows what’s going to happen, but it was not supposed to be like this…

For the last four years, Trump has been smeared by the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) as a crazed rapist, racist, and traitor owned by the Russians who must be impeached… Gee, 2020 should be a lay-up for Democrats; after all, we have all those Fox News polls proving Trump is down something like 99 points to every Democrat politician in America, including Ted Kennedy’s corpse.

Why so nervous, Democrats?

Why so nervous, media?

Why this search for a last-minute ringer when the walls are closing in on Drumpf fer realsies this time?

Well, if there’s one thing Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) remember, it’s how meaningless those polls were in 2020… And what I mean by “remember” is “still haven’t come to terms with or accepted.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is the great slight hope, has the best chance against Trump, and he’s not only a walking-talking example of the physical and mental deterioration that awaits those of us lucky enough to live so long, no matter how much the media scream HOAX on his behalf, this Ukraine-China-Hunter thing is a real problem.

Biden was a terrible candidate before he started operating just a notch above “zombie.” Today he’s not just a mess, his son Hunter’s appallingly mercenary, greedy, and unethical business practices, his shameless looting of two countries while his sitting-vice president father led American policy there, is something the Trump campaign is already exploiting.

Remember how Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election team looked at the lay of the Republican presidential field and correctly guessed Mitt Romney would come out on top? It was a gamble, but with an unlimited pile of money, it really wasn’t, and that unlimited pile of money allowed Team Obama to define Romney as a corporate raider even before he secured the nomination.

It was a brilliant play on Obama’s part, and it worked, and now Team Trump is doing the same to Biden. The far-left Politico reports the Trump campaign has spent $287,000 just in Iowa on ads that blast Biden over Ukraine, and this pales compared to the money spent on ads targeting Biden on Facebook and YouTube.

Biden is already getting roughed up and defined by Trump, his numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are cratering, and while he’s still in the lead nationally, he’s nowhere near the safe zone of 35 percent. Regardless, Iowa and New Hampshire matter. If you lose there, your national lead evaporates mighty quick.

And if Biden loses the nomination, that leaves the socialists Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg, the 11-year-old mayor black people can’t stand.

Help us, Michael Bloomberg, you’re our only hope…

The New York Post’s Michael Goodwin is a smart political observer immune to the conventional wisdom that is always wrong, and he thinks Bloomberg is a good bet for Democrats. He makes some good points, but Bloomberg’s biggest problem — by far — is that he has no natural constituency. For all his own problems, Biden has the working class and blacks. Warren and Sanders have the far-far-left. Buttigieg is making a serious play for the same kind of young people who fell in love with Obama.

Who does Bloomberg have? He’s a billionaire businessman, a pushing 80 technocrat… He might be seen as a “moderate” in the Democrat Party, a centrist, but that is where he stands politically, which has zero to do with winning votes. Amy Klobuchar is a centrist — she’s polling at 1 percent. John Hickenlooper is a centrist governor from the swing state of Colorado, he’s already been forced to drop out. The term “centrist” is meaningless without a constituency.

Sure, never bet against a guy who can write a check for $52 billion, but already Bloomberg has said he would not even try to win Iowa and New Hampshire, which I guess is a strategy — a BAD Strategy. We have decades of data proving Iowa and New Hampshire matter. You either get shot out of one of those cannons or you are doomed.

Ask Rudy Giuliani about this strategy. One of the most beloved politicians in 2008 doomed himself under the belief he could ignore Iowa and New Hampshire as he sat on his national and Florida lead and waited for the campaign to come to him. But by the time it did, he had collapsed in the polls.

Yes, Democrats have every reason to be nervous, and after Republicans turn these impeachment hearings into The Joe and Hunter Biden Looted Ukraine and China Show, they will have even more reason.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday, pointing to her advocacy for ""Medicare for All"" and saying it comes from an elitist belief that Americans shouldn't be allowed to make up their own minds on health care.

The former vice president's comments came at a CNN town hall in Iowa. During the town hall, Biden also discussed how he has connected with Americans on the campaign trail about grief. Additionally, he said he isn't worried about potential political blowback from House Democrats' impeachment proceedings.

He offered a contradictory view on Republicans, insisting they'll be more willing to work with Democrats after President Donald Trump leaves office -- while telling a story about them refusing to cooperate before Trump had even become the GOP presidential nominee.

Here are four takeaways from Biden's town hall:

Attacking Warren

Biden continued to characterize Warren as ""angry"" and ""elitist,"" saying her health care plan is driven by a belief that ""people can't make up their own mind.""

The former vice president also said he's merely been responding after ""she attacked me.""

He was referring to Warren jabbing at him for his opposition to Medicare for All, suggesting without naming the former vice president that he is running in the wrong party's presidential primary. Biden has escalated his criticism of Warren over that comment in recent days. In a Medium post published last week, he wrote that Warren, without naming her, was ""condescending"" and ""representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share.""

Biden said his criticism wasn't about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs.

This time mimicking Medicare for All proponents, Biden said Monday that what he's been calling elitist was ""the attitude that we know better than ordinary people what's in their interests. 'I know more than you, let me tell you what to do.'""

""The attitude is elitist that people can't make up their own mind,"" Biden said.

""You like your health insurance,"" he said, then dropped to a lower voice: ""'But you shouldn't like your health insurance, you should have to give that up. I'm going to demand you not have that. We're going to give you something better.'""

""It's not about her, it's about the attitude out there -- the attitude that we know best, you do it my way.""

He added: ""I resent that. And I wasn't talking about her, I was talking about the attitude that if you don't agree with me, get in the other party.""

Connecting through grief

The strongest connections Biden makes on the campaign trail often come when opening up about the tragedies he has faced -- and hearing about the deep losses of others.

Asked what it meant to have people take comfort in sharing some of their deep personal tragedies with him, Biden said, ""Well, you know, I have -- a lot of people have suffered more than I have as loss, and I have been really -- sounds bizarre to say -- lucky in the sense that I had an incredible family.""

Biden's wife and infant daughter died in a car crash in 1972 and his sons were injured. His son, Beau, died of brain cancer four years ago.

He went on to explain how his family stepped up to help him raise his children.

""When you're the recipient of someone's understanding and empathy, you understand how it can help and it's just impossible, although sometimes it's hard to not share it with others. When people come up to me often, as you've observed, is they come up and they'll walk up to me and all of a sudden a man or woman will just grab me and hug me and say, 'I just lost my son, lost my daughter, tell me, am I going to be OK, am I going to be OK?' ""

Biden said the best way to overcome tragedy is to find purpose in life.

""Purpose. And a purpose is best utilized if it relates to something that related to what the person you lost cared about,"" he said.

He continued: ""There will come a time if anybody of you are going through it where the thought of the person you lost will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to be able to make it. That's when you know. But it's hard. It's hard. It gives me some -- it gives me some sense of purpose when I'm able to be of some help.""

Contradictory takes on the GOP

Biden repeated a belief he often expresses on the campaign trail: that Republicans will be more willing to work with Democrats if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.

But he also offered a contradictory example -- one that showed, as Biden's Democratic rivals have frequently pointed out, that GOP lawmakers refused to cooperate with Democrats well before Trump became the party's standard-bearer.

Biden pointed to then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in March 2016. Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a hearing.

""I called 12 Republicans and said, 'What are you doing?' "" Biden said. ""I said, 'You realize what you're doing to the Constitution?' They said, 'We know, Joe, but here's the deal: Joe, I'm in a state where if in fact the Koch brothers drop in $10, $12 million, I will lose the primary.' ""

Garland was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Trump was elected later that year.

Still, Biden said, ""I honest to God believe, with Trump out of the way, you're going to find people screwing up a lot more courage than they had before to say, 'OK, OK, I can move now, I have more leeway.'""

Biden didn't explain why, if Republicans had been unbending before Trump due to concerns that they'd anger their conservative base, they'd be more willing to work with Democrats after his departure.

That missing link is part of what Biden's opponents have used against him: As he argues for a return to pre-Trump normalcy, his Democratic rivals -- including Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who bemoans the ""old normal"" -- say that era wasn't working for progressives, either.

Not sweating impeachment politics

Biden expressed no worries about potential electoral backlash on Monday, saying that impeachment proceedings against Trump could help convince independents and Republicans to oppose the President.

Asked whether impeachment proceedings would help or hurt Democrats in the 2020 election, Biden answered that -- no matter the political outcome -- Trump's actions have left the House of Representatives with no choice but to proceed.

""The House has no option. It has to enforce the Constitution, whether or not -- whether or not -- it turns out to work or not work, or whether or not it turns out that he should or shouldn't be kicked out of office,"" he said.

Biden added that if Democrats make a strong case that Trump violated his oath of office, ""you're going to find that those areas that are independent and Republican areas saying, whoa, whoa, we got to do something, we got to do something.""

""That's going to change their view. Let's see where the facts lead us,"" Biden said. He added: ""My job is just to go beat him."""

""I'm the one from the Midwest that has actually won in a statewide race over and over again,"" in part by attracting voters on the fence, Klobuchar said.

""Those are the kind of voters I've won and that is not true of Mayor Pete -- that is just a fact,"" Klobuchar continued. ""I also am someone that has passed multiple bills as a lead Democrat, important bills in Washington, DC. He's had a different experience.""

Klobuchar's comments join those of other female candidates who have made taking ownership of their frustration with the political status quo focal points of their campaigns.

1. Hong Kong

Protests in Hong Kong have been escalating for five months now, and several serious incidents this weekend may mark a new boiling point. A traffic police officer shot a 21-year-old protester in the torso, sparking renewed outrage and violence . (Police say the protester is expected to survive.) Hours after the shooting, a man who confronted a group of pro-democracy protesters was doused in a flammable liquid and set alight. Amid the violence, a police officer appeared to drive his motorcycle into a crowd and has been suspended by the force. All of this escalating unrest follows the death of a 22-year-old student on Friday, who passed away after falling from a parking garage during a demonstration. The surge in violence has taken a toll on the economy: Hong Kong stocks suffered their worst day in more than three months on Monday.

2. Impeachment Inquiry

Could this be the biggest week yet for the House impeachment investigation ? Those closed-door testimonies are about to become public, and Democrats will trot out a stable of career State Department employees who will testify under oath to things they've already talked about in private. On the docket: Bill Taylor, still the top State Department official in Ukraine; US Diplomat George Kent; and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Not scheduled to appear: The unknown whistleblower whose alarm uncovered Trump's alleged effort to use financial aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to further his own political interests. Republican leaders like Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham want the whistleblower to come forward and testify . House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says the whistleblower's claims have been corroborated, so an appearance would be redundant.

Bolivian President Evo Morales and Vice President Álvaro García Linera resigned yesterday amid growing outrage after an international audit found the results of last month's general election could not be validated because of ""serious irregularities."" The October elections sparked protests across the country. Thousands of demonstrators accused electoral authorities of manipulating the vote count in favor of Morales, the country's longtime socialist leader who was seeking his fourth term. Now that Morales is out, even more uncertainty is coming down the road as Bolivians must go back to the polls for a new general election. Morales was president for 14 years, and there isn't a clear successor to his administration.

Winter is DEFINITELY here. The US is in for a record-breaking Arctic blast this week that could cause temperatures in some part of the country to plummet to 30 degrees below average. The National Weather Service predicts that more than 200 record lows could be tied or set from Monday to Wednesday. The Great Plains area will probably get hit first, and then the cold will move east over the week. Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Ohio Valley may see record lows on Tuesday, and the Deep South and the Gulf Coast will feel the freeze on Wednesday. Keep those mittens handy for a while, though -- the cold may not let up for five to seven days.

Some vicarious morning traffic stress"
116,"Dana Bash and Bridget Nolan, CNN","Tune in tonight at 9 p.m. ET for a CNN presidential town hall in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden, moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett.

It's not that he couldn't move faster, it's that he clearly didn't want to. Stopping and talking to people, especially young people there to greet him, is the essence of Biden. Aides joke that it often takes him longer than scheduled for him to get to events because he talks to everyone.

That was vividly on display here, where he was taking part in a Granite State rite of passage: filing for the first-in-the-nation primary here in person. Spending the day with Biden, as CNN did on Friday, was to watch him on the front lines of an increasingly heated two-front war as he seeks his party's presidential nomination in 2020: against his Democratic rivals and also President Donald Trump

Biden continues to face attacks from Trump and his allies over his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. And the former vice president is engaged in an increasingly ugly back and forth with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over health care policy.

When asked if Trump's relentless attacks are helping, without hesitation, he said yes.

""They're helping me in every way,"" Biden tells us, arguing the basics: Democratic voters see that the President considers him a threat.

Biden also suggested that he doesn't want to fight with Warren but feels he has no choice after she suggested his arguments against her plan to fund ""Medicare for All"" meant he was running in the wrong presidential primary. He responded by calling her approach elitist , writing that they ""reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics."" On Friday, in an email to supporters, Warren embraced the angry label, writing, ""I am angry and I own it,"" and said women have been told ""over and over"" that they are not allowed to be angry.

Biden told us attacking Warren, using a term some see as sexist, was ""not anything that I did or was intended to do.""

""I was responding to a comment she made,"" Biden said. ""She said that anyone who disagreed with her and took her on, on her issue of Medicare for All, somehow either was a coward, wasn't willing to stand up and state what they thought. Somehow doing something -- I think the phrase was should be in a Republican primary. When we talk about Medicare for All, people talk about taking two years, five years, 10 years to get it done. That doesn't give any real reassurance to people out there,"" he explained.

When asked directly whether somebody who supports Medicare for All, a sweeping liberal proposal that would create a national health care system, can beat Donald Trump, Biden demurred.

""I'm not going to make that judgment,"" he told CNN.

Biden's sharpened attacks on Warren comes as a recent Monmouth University poll shows Warren catching Biden at the top of the field among Democrats nationally. She has also placed in the top tier in the most recent surveys of likely Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, while Biden has fallen behind the pack in some early state polls.

The rough reality for Biden, one his campaign started setting expectations about months ago, is that despite being a front-runner, he's not there alone and he very well could lose Iowa and New Hampshire.

If that happened, would his candidacy survive?

""I think I'm going to do better in both places than that,"" Biden insisted.

Pushed again on what would happen, Biden replied: ""Not going to go there,"" he replied.

On the trail

For Biden, being greeted here in New Hampshire by throngs of people holding campaign signs and beating drums (props born out of one of Biden's greatest hits lines -- that he will beat Trump ""like a drum"") was a chance to show passion behind a candidacy that leans hard into the practical.

""Eight years of Donald Trump will forever and fundamentally change the character of this country, and that's why I am running,"" Biden declared at a rally outside on a blustery cold day.

Other candidates, especially his fellow leading contenders like Warren and Bernie Sanders, are selling a wholesale change in approach to governance. Biden is not. He is all about getting Trump out of the White House and says he's the best to do it.

Still, in an interview inside the State House gift shop, he insisted that his candidacy is about more than a pragmatic promise to beat Trump.

""You feel passion for your campaign?"" we asked.

""I do, sure I do. Or I wouldn't be, look, the only reason I'm doing this is because we cannot, we cannot continue down the road of dividing this nation and walking away from the rest of the world,"" he replied, ticking off reasons he said the President has hurt America globally.

It's an understandable approach. Talking to voters who came to see him, many said flatly that the main reason they're considering supporting Biden is because he has the best chance of defeating the President, which anecdotally here, just as in polls of Democratic voters, matters more than anything to them in 2020.

On the stump, Biden's campaign clearly tries to weave in reminders of his experience, with opportunities to show how he has grown.

At a roundtable to discuss the Violence Against Women Act, which he helped write in the Senate, Biden goes deep into the history of how hard it was to convince his male colleagues to make changes that are taken for granted in 2019, like making it illegal for a man to rape his wife.

To show he has a grasp on modern day issues, he reminded the audience that men -- especially trans men -- are frequent victims of violence.

Events like this also allow for Biden to do what Biden does best: emote and empathize. After the event was over and the microphones turned off, he stayed in his seat talking intensely to a woman who told her own story of being a victim of violence.

Later, at a town hall in Franklin, New Hampshire, two of the questioners were children. One about climate change, and another about gun violence.

""How are you going to make schools more safe from mass shootings?"" asked a 10-year-old boy who said his name was Jordan.

""Think about this. Those of you over 30. Could you ever imagine having asked that question?"" responded with a question of his own from the audience.

""You talk about the soul of America. It's a sick soul we have when in fact we send our kids into school these days that duck and cover."" he added.

Third time a charm?

The first time Biden ran for president was 1987. The world has changed a lot since then, and -- riding with him to an event -- he insists he has changed with it. This is Biden's third time running for president, which he admitted is tricky.

""The good news is the bad news. Everybody knows me. Everybody has an opinion. So it's harder to mislabel me or to say something about me that's not true. I have weaknesses. It's easier to talk about the weaknesses, but the generic point is that people know who I am,"" he said.

Familiarity and comfort drew voters we talked to see him, even though some said they're are not sold yet.

Ruth Kovacs and Terri Arangio were at the State House to see Biden wearing his campaign stickers and holding his signs.

But they told us they're still actively candidate shopping.

""Not 100%"" Kovacs said about her support for Biden. ""Personally, I like the middle of the roaders, not far left. I like Amy [Klobuchar], Pete Buttigieg and of course Joe Biden.""

""I've always loved Joe Biden,"" added Arangio.

""He's a likable guy, he says what it is, sometimes he has his gaffes, but I think that's what makes Joe Joe.""

We met several voters who said they came to see Biden in person, a privilege that Granite State voters hold dear, in order to see for themselves if the 76-year-old former vice president seems too old to be president.

Eric Swendsen came to the Franklin town hall with concerns about Biden's age, but told us he felt better after seeing him in action.

""I think he'll be fine. I think he'll be just fine,"" Swendsen said in his post-town hall assessment.

It is a topic we discussed with Biden during our car ride -- that anecdotally older voters who are his age tell us they can't imagine having the stamina to be president.

""What I tell them is, 'Watch me.' Oh God. The one thing that I've learned is, hopefully that age comes with experience, with experience comes with adjustment, and with adjustment comes some wisdom."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D), a Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday revealed.

Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed.

The Monmouth University poll, taken November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren’s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth’s previous poll.

No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three — Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:

Bloomberg 0%

Delaney 0%

Sestak 0% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) November 12, 2019

According to Monmouth, Buttigieg “has gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.”

Per Monmouth:

His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren). Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden’s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders). Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren).

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said, noting that the presidential hopeful’s support cannot be attributed to any one group.

“While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,” he continued. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent."

“New Hampshire has mountains. Iowa has plains. They couldn’t be more different except for the results of the last two Quinnipiac University polls, which both show 4 candidates in the top tier,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy stated, warning that the state’s lineup is “far from rock solid.”

“Although Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it’s far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs,” Malloy added.

Quinnipiac also asked 636 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters if they would support Michael Bloomberg. Only two percent signaled they would “definitely” support him, while 37 percent said they “would consider voting for him.” The majority, 54 percent, said they “definitely would not vote for him.” The margin of error for that question is +/- 5 percent.

“If he truly is in, there is a lot of work to do. But with vast resources to draw from, Michael Bloomberg’s nascent campaign could morph from ‘under construction’ to ‘full steam ahead’ in a New York minute,” Malloy said."

New Hampshire and Arkansas expire this week. The heavy hitters of Illinois, California, and Texas are just weeks away. Ohio and North Carolina arrive before Christmas.

In other words, unless someone gets off the pot, the current 2020 crop of tired, old extremists is locked in forever. Which means one of them will face Trump in 2020, and a quick look around shows that Democrats are not happy about that.

There are rumblings about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg seriously considering taking the plunge. There’s even talk about former Attorney General Eric Holder. And because she’s a vampire who keeps coming back in terrible sequels, there’s Hillary.

No one knows what’s going to happen, but it was not supposed to be like this…

For the last four years, Trump has been smeared by the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) as a crazed rapist, racist, and traitor owned by the Russians who must be impeached… Gee, 2020 should be a lay-up for Democrats; after all, we have all those Fox News polls proving Trump is down something like 99 points to every Democrat politician in America, including Ted Kennedy’s corpse.

Why so nervous, Democrats?

Why so nervous, media?

Why this search for a last-minute ringer when the walls are closing in on Drumpf fer realsies this time?

Well, if there’s one thing Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) remember, it’s how meaningless those polls were in 2020… And what I mean by “remember” is “still haven’t come to terms with or accepted.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is the great slight hope, has the best chance against Trump, and he’s not only a walking-talking example of the physical and mental deterioration that awaits those of us lucky enough to live so long, no matter how much the media scream HOAX on his behalf, this Ukraine-China-Hunter thing is a real problem.

Biden was a terrible candidate before he started operating just a notch above “zombie.” Today he’s not just a mess, his son Hunter’s appallingly mercenary, greedy, and unethical business practices, his shameless looting of two countries while his sitting-vice president father led American policy there, is something the Trump campaign is already exploiting.

Remember how Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election team looked at the lay of the Republican presidential field and correctly guessed Mitt Romney would come out on top? It was a gamble, but with an unlimited pile of money, it really wasn’t, and that unlimited pile of money allowed Team Obama to define Romney as a corporate raider even before he secured the nomination.

It was a brilliant play on Obama’s part, and it worked, and now Team Trump is doing the same to Biden. The far-left Politico reports the Trump campaign has spent $287,000 just in Iowa on ads that blast Biden over Ukraine, and this pales compared to the money spent on ads targeting Biden on Facebook and YouTube.

Biden is already getting roughed up and defined by Trump, his numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are cratering, and while he’s still in the lead nationally, he’s nowhere near the safe zone of 35 percent. Regardless, Iowa and New Hampshire matter. If you lose there, your national lead evaporates mighty quick.

And if Biden loses the nomination, that leaves the socialists Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg, the 11-year-old mayor black people can’t stand.

Help us, Michael Bloomberg, you’re our only hope…

The New York Post’s Michael Goodwin is a smart political observer immune to the conventional wisdom that is always wrong, and he thinks Bloomberg is a good bet for Democrats. He makes some good points, but Bloomberg’s biggest problem — by far — is that he has no natural constituency. For all his own problems, Biden has the working class and blacks. Warren and Sanders have the far-far-left. Buttigieg is making a serious play for the same kind of young people who fell in love with Obama.

Who does Bloomberg have? He’s a billionaire businessman, a pushing 80 technocrat… He might be seen as a “moderate” in the Democrat Party, a centrist, but that is where he stands politically, which has zero to do with winning votes. Amy Klobuchar is a centrist — she’s polling at 1 percent. John Hickenlooper is a centrist governor from the swing state of Colorado, he’s already been forced to drop out. The term “centrist” is meaningless without a constituency.

Sure, never bet against a guy who can write a check for $52 billion, but already Bloomberg has said he would not even try to win Iowa and New Hampshire, which I guess is a strategy — a BAD Strategy. We have decades of data proving Iowa and New Hampshire matter. You either get shot out of one of those cannons or you are doomed.

Ask Rudy Giuliani about this strategy. One of the most beloved politicians in 2008 doomed himself under the belief he could ignore Iowa and New Hampshire as he sat on his national and Florida lead and waited for the campaign to come to him. But by the time it did, he had collapsed in the polls.

Yes, Democrats have every reason to be nervous, and after Republicans turn these impeachment hearings into The Joe and Hunter Biden Looted Ukraine and China Show, they will have even more reason.

“Suburban women, who power a significant electoral battleground, are a key demographic for 2020,” wrote Grace Haley at the research group that tracks money in U.S. politics. “Since Trump’s inauguration, more than 7,000 women in suburban districts have given large-dollar contributions to his campaign. That totals $8 million, the most of all candidates.”

Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner, drew attention to the Open Secrets report.

He noted that 28 percent of Trump’s “itemized contributions” were from women in 2016.

“For the 2020 election, they are 35 [percent],” Bedard reported.

On paper, Trump ranks fifth in donations from women at $15.1 million, with the leader in donations from women reported from Sen. Bernie Sanders at $17.1 million, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who have all raised $15 million or more from women, Open Secrets reported.

However, the research group also observed that “Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million” since the Trump campaign does not report demographic information about its small donors:

Campaigns are not required to itemize donations of $200 or less, so we do not have demographic information about Trump’s small donors giving to his joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee, Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. An estimated 59 percent of Trump’s donations are from small-donors, so Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million. Trump’s totals are underestimated more than the other candidates. Because Democrats are relying on ActBlue and the Republicans are not relying on the Republican equivalent WinRed as significantly, we only have most (not all) donor demographic data for Democratic small-dollar donors.

Amy Kremer, chairwoman of Women for America First and co-founder and chair of Women for Trump PAC, told Breitbart News it is “no surprise that women are contributing to the president’s campaign” since many women in suburbs have families and children.

“Women are focused on issues that impact our children and our families and President Trump is delivering results,” she said, adding that when women contribute to his campaign “it’s an easy donation when you know what you are going to get in return and this president has followed through on his promises, and his policies have been good for women and their families.”

Open Secrets noted the Trump campaign says there are often more suburban women supporting the president than reported because “the polling data does not account for suburban women who favor Trump but do not feel comfortable publicly saying so.”

Kremer agreed with this statement.

“Not all women who support the President may be vocal about their support, but they are quietly doing their share to ensure another four years of America First with President Trump,” she said."

When the impeachment frenzy began in September, the former vice president was still leading his Democrat rivals by solid margins, according to national and state polls. Weeks of revelations about influence peddling in the Obama-era State Department and the conflicts of interest between the former vice president’s office and the business interests of his youngest son, Hunter, however, have taken their toll.

This was first evidenced by the Biden campaign’s fundraising troubles and has more recently been exhibited by the former vice president’s slippage in the polls.

Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading his fellow 2020 Democrats by as much as double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa in late-October showed the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Warren (D-MA), but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Since that time, two other polls have also shown Biden firmly in fourth place, according to polling data compiled by Real Clear Politics.

A similar situation has played out in New Hampshire, where Biden once led by more than 15 percentage points, the former vice president has been eclipsed by neighboring state rival, Warren. In fact, Biden had not led Warren in the first primary state in any poll taken between mid-September and November. That trend was only broken on Monday when a Quinnipiac Poll found the former vice president with a four percentage point advantage over Warren in New Hampshire. Although Biden’s campaign was quick to laud the poll as proof their campaign was rebounding, they failed to mention that the former vice president’s lead was exactly within the margin of error.

Biden has also faltered nationally in the race for the Democrat nomination, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from October found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden’s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to 27 percent.

Several national polls from the past week continue to show Biden in decline. A Monmouth University poll conducted between October 30 and November 3, found the former vice president in a statistical tie with Warren, with both Democrats pulling 23 percent of the vote. Likewise, a poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov between November 3 through November 5 showed Biden with narrow one point advantage, well within the margin of error, over Warren.

Not only are Biden’s fortunes dropping in the race for the Democrat nomination, but his viability for the general election is also taking a hit. When Biden first entered the 2020 race, most polls had him leading the president by wide margins. In June, alone, a Quinnipiac Poll had Biden leading Trump in a head-t0-head matchup by 13 percentage points, 53 percent to 40 percent. Now the former vice presidents leads Trump narrowly, often within the margin of error. An Emerson poll conducted in October, indicated Biden only had a one percentage point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent, in a hypothetical general election.

The Morning Consult found a similar trend in its national polling data. In between June and October, Trump was able to cut Biden’s lead in a potential general election by half. In June, the Morning Consult’s poll found Biden with an 11 point advantage over the incumbent. The same poll conduct at the end of October found the former vice president only leading Trump by five percentage points. The president’s ability came from improved numbers among women and voters between the ages of 18-to-29 years of age—two demographic groups essential to a Democrat’s retaking the White House in 2020.

Biden’s drop in the polls has occurred as his son’s wheeling and dealing in Ukraine has come to for-front of the impeachment inquiry. The controversy started when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, an eastern European oil and gas Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the company in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in Ukraine.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting Western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering.

Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be charged with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.

Joe Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter.

Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor, who is now himself being investigated for public corruption, dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Although the former vice president and his son have denied any wrongdoing, voters do not seem to be buying their arguments.

A recent poll by the Associated Press found that 69 percent of Americans believe Hunter Biden’s work on behalf of Burisma was inappropriate. Furthermore, a Harvard/Harris poll taken at the same time showed that a 51 percent of Americans think the younger Biden should return any money he made through his ventures in Ukraine."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday, pointing to her advocacy for ""Medicare for All"" and saying it comes from an elitist belief that Americans shouldn't be allowed to make up their own minds on health care.

The former vice president's comments came at a CNN town hall in Iowa. During the town hall, Biden also discussed how he has connected with Americans on the campaign trail about grief. Additionally, he said he isn't worried about potential political blowback from House Democrats' impeachment proceedings.

He offered a contradictory view on Republicans, insisting they'll be more willing to work with Democrats after President Donald Trump leaves office -- while telling a story about them refusing to cooperate before Trump had even become the GOP presidential nominee.

Here are four takeaways from Biden's town hall:

Attacking Warren

Biden continued to characterize Warren as ""angry"" and ""elitist,"" saying her health care plan is driven by a belief that ""people can't make up their own mind.""

The former vice president also said he's merely been responding after ""she attacked me.""

He was referring to Warren jabbing at him for his opposition to Medicare for All, suggesting without naming the former vice president that he is running in the wrong party's presidential primary. Biden has escalated his criticism of Warren over that comment in recent days. In a Medium post published last week, he wrote that Warren, without naming her, was ""condescending"" and ""representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share.""

Biden said his criticism wasn't about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs.

This time mimicking Medicare for All proponents, Biden said Monday that what he's been calling elitist was ""the attitude that we know better than ordinary people what's in their interests. 'I know more than you, let me tell you what to do.'""

""The attitude is elitist that people can't make up their own mind,"" Biden said.

""You like your health insurance,"" he said, then dropped to a lower voice: ""'But you shouldn't like your health insurance, you should have to give that up. I'm going to demand you not have that. We're going to give you something better.'""

""It's not about her, it's about the attitude out there -- the attitude that we know best, you do it my way.""

He added: ""I resent that. And I wasn't talking about her, I was talking about the attitude that if you don't agree with me, get in the other party.""

Connecting through grief

The strongest connections Biden makes on the campaign trail often come when opening up about the tragedies he has faced -- and hearing about the deep losses of others.

Asked what it meant to have people take comfort in sharing some of their deep personal tragedies with him, Biden said, ""Well, you know, I have -- a lot of people have suffered more than I have as loss, and I have been really -- sounds bizarre to say -- lucky in the sense that I had an incredible family.""

Biden's wife and infant daughter died in a car crash in 1972 and his sons were injured. His son, Beau, died of brain cancer four years ago.

He went on to explain how his family stepped up to help him raise his children.

""When you're the recipient of someone's understanding and empathy, you understand how it can help and it's just impossible, although sometimes it's hard to not share it with others. When people come up to me often, as you've observed, is they come up and they'll walk up to me and all of a sudden a man or woman will just grab me and hug me and say, 'I just lost my son, lost my daughter, tell me, am I going to be OK, am I going to be OK?' ""

Biden said the best way to overcome tragedy is to find purpose in life.

""Purpose. And a purpose is best utilized if it relates to something that related to what the person you lost cared about,"" he said.

He continued: ""There will come a time if anybody of you are going through it where the thought of the person you lost will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to be able to make it. That's when you know. But it's hard. It's hard. It gives me some -- it gives me some sense of purpose when I'm able to be of some help.""

Contradictory takes on the GOP

Biden repeated a belief he often expresses on the campaign trail: that Republicans will be more willing to work with Democrats if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.

But he also offered a contradictory example -- one that showed, as Biden's Democratic rivals have frequently pointed out, that GOP lawmakers refused to cooperate with Democrats well before Trump became the party's standard-bearer.

Biden pointed to then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in March 2016. Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a hearing.

""I called 12 Republicans and said, 'What are you doing?' "" Biden said. ""I said, 'You realize what you're doing to the Constitution?' They said, 'We know, Joe, but here's the deal: Joe, I'm in a state where if in fact the Koch brothers drop in $10, $12 million, I will lose the primary.' ""

Garland was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Trump was elected later that year.

Still, Biden said, ""I honest to God believe, with Trump out of the way, you're going to find people screwing up a lot more courage than they had before to say, 'OK, OK, I can move now, I have more leeway.'""

Biden didn't explain why, if Republicans had been unbending before Trump due to concerns that they'd anger their conservative base, they'd be more willing to work with Democrats after his departure.

That missing link is part of what Biden's opponents have used against him: As he argues for a return to pre-Trump normalcy, his Democratic rivals -- including Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who bemoans the ""old normal"" -- say that era wasn't working for progressives, either.

Not sweating impeachment politics

Biden expressed no worries about potential electoral backlash on Monday, saying that impeachment proceedings against Trump could help convince independents and Republicans to oppose the President.

Asked whether impeachment proceedings would help or hurt Democrats in the 2020 election, Biden answered that -- no matter the political outcome -- Trump's actions have left the House of Representatives with no choice but to proceed.

""The House has no option. It has to enforce the Constitution, whether or not -- whether or not -- it turns out to work or not work, or whether or not it turns out that he should or shouldn't be kicked out of office,"" he said.

Biden added that if Democrats make a strong case that Trump violated his oath of office, ""you're going to find that those areas that are independent and Republican areas saying, whoa, whoa, we got to do something, we got to do something.""

""That's going to change their view. Let's see where the facts lead us,"" Biden said. He added: ""My job is just to go beat him."""

On the eve of the first public impeachment hearings, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a run to Arkansas on Tuesday to secure his spot on that state's Democratic primary ballot, should he decide to run. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick weighed a late entry to the race while facing down Friday's filing deadline in the key state of New Hampshire. And Hillary Clinton coyly suggested, once again, that she could leap from the sidelines.

Clearly enjoying the opportunity to taunt Trump at this vulnerable moment in his presidency -- and undoubtedly unnerving some current 2020 Democrats -- Clinton told BBC Radio that she was not running for president in 2020, but she left the door ajar.

""Never say never, and I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,"" Clinton told BBC radio in the midst of a publicity tour for her new book with her daughter, Chelsea. ""But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.""

In Clinton's case, teasing another White House bid was most likely a lighthearted way of drawing publicity for her new book. Last month, when Trump tweeted that ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" should run again to ""steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,"" the 2016 Democratic nominee playfully tweeted back : ""Don't tempt me. Do your job."" ( CNN reported in October that Clinton's admirers have tried to coax her off the sidelines, but she has repeatedly ruled out a run).

Still, the fact that Patrick and Bloomberg could soon join the field underscores how fractured Democrats are three months before the opening contest in Iowa.

The party still has not settled its long-running debate about whether to swing hard to the left by nominating a candidate like Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- both of whom have excited a younger generation of activists -- or embrace a more moderate candidate who could theoretically appeal to Republicans and independents disenchanted by Trump, as well as blue-collar voters who the party lost to Trump in 2016.

The latest polls in early-primary states demonstrate that lack of consensus among Democrats about who would be strongest against Trump, which has prompted much of the hand-wringing in recent months.

A new Monmouth University poll of likely caucusgoers out Tuesday showed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging to the top of the field with 22%, followed by Biden with 19%, Warren with 18% and Sanders at 13%. All four were within the margin of error -- meaning that none of them could claim front-runner status in the Hawkeye State. (Bloomberg registered at 1%).

Biden held a slender lead in New Hampshire in a new Quinnipiac University poll t his week with the support of 20% of likely voters in the state. Warren followed at 16%, Buttigieg at 15% and Sanders at 14%.

The glimmer of hope for Patrick and Bloomberg at this late stage is rooted in Democrats' uncertainty about Biden, who was perceived as a far stronger front-runner before he entered the race earlier this year. But both men are untested among the broader electorate.

The filing deadlines to get on key state ballots this week appear to have forced the hand of Bloomberg and Patrick, who could face a major disadvantage if they miss the chance to compete in all 50 states, particularly if the race devolves into a prolonged delegate fight.

Last week Bloomberg's team filed the paperwork needed to get on the primary ballot in Alabama. (Patrick missed the deadlines in Alabama and appears to have missed Arkansas').

Bloomberg's adviser Howard Wolfson told CNN in a statement last week that Bloomberg plans to skip the first four primary contests. ""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,"" Wolfson said.

On Tuesday in Arkansas, Bloomberg told a gaggle of reporters he was ""still exploring what we're going to do"" and deflected questions about Biden's strength as a candidate, calling him ""a very nice guy.""

""I've known him for a long time, and if you want to know about Joe Biden, you've got to talk to Joe Biden. He's running his campaign, I'm running mine and one thing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with another,"" Bloomberg told reporters.

""All I've got to do is -- if I run -- explain to people what I think is wrong with this country, and how I would fix it. And then the public can make a decision,"" the former New York mayor said.

""I've been more and more upset with what's going on here,"" he said. ""We don't talk to each other. We don't work together. There's a lack of honesty and civility. That is not good for our country, and I've got two daughters and two grandkids that I care about. And I'd like to do something about it, whether it's running for president or something else."""

Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed.

The Monmouth University poll, taken November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren’s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth’s previous poll.

No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three — Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:

Bennet 0%

Bloomberg 0%

Delaney 0%

Williamson 0%

Sestak 0% — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) November 12, 2019

According to Monmouth, Buttigieg “has gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.”

Per Monmouth:

His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren). Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden’s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders). Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren).

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said, noting that the presidential hopeful’s support cannot be attributed to any one group.

“While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,” he continued. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent."

While mainstream media are reporting some polls that suggest Trump is losing the support of women, the report by Open Secrets, part of the Center for Responsive Politics, shows the president has over 10,500 large-dollar contributions from women in suburbs, and has received $8,293,135 from them – the largest amount than any of the Democrat 2020 candidates.

“Suburban women, who power a significant electoral battleground, are a key demographic for 2020,” wrote Grace Haley at the research group that tracks money in U.S. politics. “Since Trump’s inauguration, more than 7,000 women in suburban districts have given large-dollar contributions to his campaign. That totals $8 million, the most of all candidates.”

Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner, drew attention to the Open Secrets report.

He noted that 28 percent of Trump’s “itemized contributions” were from women in 2016.

“For the 2020 election, they are 35 [percent],” Bedard reported.

On paper, Trump ranks fifth in donations from women at $15.1 million, with the leader in donations from women reported from Sen. Bernie Sanders at $17.1 million, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who have all raised $15 million or more from women, Open Secrets reported.

However, the research group also observed that “Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million” since the Trump campaign does not report demographic information about its small donors:

Campaigns are not required to itemize donations of $200 or less, so we do not have demographic information about Trump’s small donors giving to his joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee, Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. An estimated 59 percent of Trump’s donations are from small-donors, so Trump’s contributions from women are most certainly higher than $15 million. Trump’s totals are underestimated more than the other candidates. Because Democrats are relying on ActBlue and the Republicans are not relying on the Republican equivalent WinRed as significantly, we only have most (not all) donor demographic data for Democratic small-dollar donors.

Amy Kremer, chairwoman of Women for America First and co-founder and chair of Women for Trump PAC, told Breitbart News it is “no surprise that women are contributing to the president’s campaign” since many women in suburbs have families and children.

“Women are focused on issues that impact our children and our families and President Trump is delivering results,” she said, adding that when women contribute to his campaign “it’s an easy donation when you know what you are going to get in return and this president has followed through on his promises, and his policies have been good for women and their families.”

Open Secrets noted the Trump campaign says there are often more suburban women supporting the president than reported because “the polling data does not account for suburban women who favor Trump but do not feel comfortable publicly saying so.”

Kremer agreed with this statement.

“Not all women who support the President may be vocal about their support, but they are quietly doing their share to ensure another four years of America First with President Trump,” she said."

When the impeachment frenzy began in September, the former vice president was still leading his Democrat rivals by solid margins, according to national and state polls. Weeks of revelations about influence peddling in the Obama-era State Department and the conflicts of interest between the former vice president’s office and the business interests of his youngest son, Hunter, however, have taken their toll.

This was first evidenced by the Biden campaign’s fundraising troubles and has more recently been exhibited by the former vice president’s slippage in the polls.

Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading his fellow 2020 Democrats by as much as double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa in late-October showed the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Warren (D-MA), but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Since that time, two other polls have also shown Biden firmly in fourth place, according to polling data compiled by Real Clear Politics.

A similar situation has played out in New Hampshire, where Biden once led by more than 15 percentage points, the former vice president has been eclipsed by neighboring state rival, Warren. In fact, Biden had not led Warren in the first primary state in any poll taken between mid-September and November. That trend was only broken on Monday when a Quinnipiac Poll found the former vice president with a four percentage point advantage over Warren in New Hampshire. Although Biden’s campaign was quick to laud the poll as proof their campaign was rebounding, they failed to mention that the former vice president’s lead was exactly within the margin of error.

Biden has also faltered nationally in the race for the Democrat nomination, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from October found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden’s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to 27 percent.

Several national polls from the past week continue to show Biden in decline. A Monmouth University poll conducted between October 30 and November 3, found the former vice president in a statistical tie with Warren, with both Democrats pulling 23 percent of the vote. Likewise, a poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov between November 3 through November 5 showed Biden with narrow one point advantage, well within the margin of error, over Warren.

Not only are Biden’s fortunes dropping in the race for the Democrat nomination, but his viability for the general election is also taking a hit. When Biden first entered the 2020 race, most polls had him leading the president by wide margins. In June, alone, a Quinnipiac Poll had Biden leading Trump in a head-t0-head matchup by 13 percentage points, 53 percent to 40 percent. Now the former vice presidents leads Trump narrowly, often within the margin of error. An Emerson poll conducted in October, indicated Biden only had a one percentage point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent, in a hypothetical general election.

The Morning Consult found a similar trend in its national polling data. In between June and October, Trump was able to cut Biden’s lead in a potential general election by half. In June, the Morning Consult’s poll found Biden with an 11 point advantage over the incumbent. The same poll conduct at the end of October found the former vice president only leading Trump by five percentage points. The president’s ability came from improved numbers among women and voters between the ages of 18-to-29 years of age—two demographic groups essential to a Democrat’s retaking the White House in 2020.

Biden’s drop in the polls has occurred as his son’s wheeling and dealing in Ukraine has come to for-front of the impeachment inquiry. The controversy started when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, an eastern European oil and gas Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the company in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in Ukraine.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting Western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering.

Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be charged with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.

Joe Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter.

Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor, who is now himself being investigated for public corruption, dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Although the former vice president and his son have denied any wrongdoing, voters do not seem to be buying their arguments.

A recent poll by the Associated Press found that 69 percent of Americans believe Hunter Biden’s work on behalf of Burisma was inappropriate. Furthermore, a Harvard/Harris poll taken at the same time showed that a 51 percent of Americans think the younger Biden should return any money he made through his ventures in Ukraine."

On the eve of the first public impeachment hearings, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a run to Arkansas on Tuesday to secure his spot on that state's Democratic primary ballot, should he decide to run. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick weighed a late entry to the race while facing down Friday's filing deadline in the key state of New Hampshire. And Hillary Clinton coyly suggested, once again, that she could leap from the sidelines.

Clearly enjoying the opportunity to taunt Trump at this vulnerable moment in his presidency -- and undoubtedly unnerving some current 2020 Democrats -- Clinton told BBC Radio that she was not running for president in 2020, but she left the door ajar.

""Never say never, and I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,"" Clinton told BBC radio in the midst of a publicity tour for her new book with her daughter, Chelsea. ""But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.""

In Clinton's case, teasing another White House bid was most likely a lighthearted way of drawing publicity for her new book. Last month, when Trump tweeted that ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" should run again to ""steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,"" the 2016 Democratic nominee playfully tweeted back : ""Don't tempt me. Do your job."" ( CNN reported in October that Clinton's admirers have tried to coax her off the sidelines, but she has repeatedly ruled out a run).

Still, the fact that Patrick and Bloomberg could soon join the field underscores how fractured Democrats are three months before the opening contest in Iowa.

The party still has not settled its long-running debate about whether to swing hard to the left by nominating a candidate like Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- both of whom have excited a younger generation of activists -- or embrace a more moderate candidate who could theoretically appeal to Republicans and independents disenchanted by Trump, as well as blue-collar voters who the party lost to Trump in 2016.

The latest polls in early-primary states demonstrate that lack of consensus among Democrats about who would be strongest against Trump, which has prompted much of the hand-wringing in recent months.

A new Monmouth University poll of likely caucusgoers out Tuesday showed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging to the top of the field with 22%, followed by Biden with 19%, Warren with 18% and Sanders at 13%. All four were within the margin of error -- meaning that none of them could claim front-runner status in the Hawkeye State. (Bloomberg registered at 1%).

Biden held a slender lead in New Hampshire in a new Quinnipiac University poll t his week with the support of 20% of likely voters in the state. Warren followed at 16%, Buttigieg at 15% and Sanders at 14%.

The glimmer of hope for Patrick and Bloomberg at this late stage is rooted in Democrats' uncertainty about Biden, who was perceived as a far stronger front-runner before he entered the race earlier this year. But both men are untested among the broader electorate.

The filing deadlines to get on key state ballots this week appear to have forced the hand of Bloomberg and Patrick, who could face a major disadvantage if they miss the chance to compete in all 50 states, particularly if the race devolves into a prolonged delegate fight.

Last week Bloomberg's team filed the paperwork needed to get on the primary ballot in Alabama. (Patrick missed the deadlines in Alabama and appears to have missed Arkansas').

Bloomberg's adviser Howard Wolfson told CNN in a statement last week that Bloomberg plans to skip the first four primary contests. ""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,"" Wolfson said.

On Tuesday in Arkansas, Bloomberg told a gaggle of reporters he was ""still exploring what we're going to do"" and deflected questions about Biden's strength as a candidate, calling him ""a very nice guy.""

""I've known him for a long time, and if you want to know about Joe Biden, you've got to talk to Joe Biden. He's running his campaign, I'm running mine and one thing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with another,"" Bloomberg told reporters.

""All I've got to do is -- if I run -- explain to people what I think is wrong with this country, and how I would fix it. And then the public can make a decision,"" the former New York mayor said.

""I've been more and more upset with what's going on here,"" he said. ""We don't talk to each other. We don't work together. There's a lack of honesty and civility. That is not good for our country, and I've got two daughters and two grandkids that I care about. And I'd like to do something about it, whether it's running for president or something else."""

At this point, there are really only two people who could scramble the board: Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama. Patrick is waaaay behind in the crucial areas of fundraising and field organization, and has no national name recognition.

Nevertheless, Patrick, a popular two-term governor, has some things going for him. At 63, he’s younger than 77-year-old Biden (But who isn’t? — oh, yeah, Bernie Sanders.), he’s not disintegrating mentally and physically like Biden, he’s not a demented socialist like Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, he’s older than 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, and as a black man he can win those votes in South Carolina.

In other words, had he launched his campaign months ago, he might very well be the frontrunner today.

Granted, there are also some benefits to jumping in late. He’s a clean slate without any gaffes, and he knows what the competition is up to.

The deficits, however, are huge. On top of money and organizational issues, after leaving the governor’s office in 2015, he went to work for *shuts off lights, places flashlight under chin* BBBBAAAAAIN CAAAAAAPITAL.

You remember Bain Capital, the organization evil corporate raider Mitt Romney worked for, the organization Obama used to beat Romney senseless with during their 2012 presidential match, the organization that gives women cancer?

Yep, same Bain.

In a party openly embracing socialism, a party that turned the words “Bain” and “Capital” into the Boogeyman… Well, let’s just say Warren and Sanders are going to have a field day. And if the unexpected happens and Patrick does win the nomination, Trump will have countless clips of Obama and other high profile Democrats (not to mention the media) declaring Bain a disqualifier for the presidency.

Patrick’s late entry is a Hail Mary, but a calculated one… The question is, why?

Well, Patrick and Obama are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer.

But Patrick is getting in now, isn’t he? And it is more than fair to assume he’s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious…

As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren’s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay… But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn’t have the stuff.

To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He’s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running.

And then there’s Joe and his son Hunter looting China and Ukraine, the two countries Obama put Biden in charge of. Although Democrats and the media are frantically trying to cover for Biden with this stupid impeachment crusade, Trump’s numbers haven’t moved, while Quid Pro Joe’s have sunk.

Don’t forget Joe’s looting reflects on Obama, on his legacy, and if impeachment hits the Senate for a trial, Republicans are in charge over there, which means any trial that takes place will be a referendum on Joe and Hunter Biden just as Iowa and New Hampshire get ready to vote.

Obama is looking at his legacy, he is looking at the quality of a hapless Democrat field, and he is so concerned he just stabbed Biden, his ever-loyal vice president, right in the back, and is doing so with the biggest vote of “no confidence” a frontrunner ever received in modern presidential politics.

Sure, Patrick may swipe some New Hampshire voters from Warren and Bernie, but that’s unlikely. The Democrats who back Bernie and Warren are in love. No, Patrick’s beliefs align more closely with Biden, and the threat he represents is aimed right at Biden’s Achilles heel: the black vote that is just barely keeping Biden above water.

And if the unexpected happens and Patrick does win the nomination, Trump will have countless clips of Obama and other high profile Democrats (not to mention the media) declaring Bain a disqualifier for the presidency.

Patrick’s late entry is a Hail Mary, but a calculated one… The question is, why?

Well, Patrick and Obama are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer.

But Patrick is getting in now, isn’t he? And it is more than fair to assume he’s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious…

As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren’s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay… But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn’t have the stuff.

To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He’s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running.

And then there’s Joe and his son Hunter looting China and Ukraine, the two countries Obama put Biden in charge of. Although Democrats and the media are frantically trying to cover for Biden with this stupid impeachment crusade, Trump’s numbers haven’t moved, while Quid Pro Joe’s have sunk.

Don’t forget Joe’s looting reflects on Obama, on his legacy, and if impeachment hits the Senate for a trial, Republicans are in charge over there, which means any trial that takes place will be a referendum on Joe and Hunter Biden just as Iowa and New Hampshire get ready to vote.

Obama is looking at his legacy, he is looking at the quality of a hapless Democrat field, and he is so concerned he just stabbed Biden, his ever-loyal vice president, right in the back, and is doing so with the biggest vote of “no confidence” a frontrunner ever received in modern presidential politics.

Sure, Patrick may swipe some New Hampshire voters from Warren and Bernie, but that’s unlikely. The Democrats who back Bernie and Warren are in love. No, Patrick’s beliefs align more closely with Biden, and the threat he represents is aimed right at Biden’s Achilles heel: the black vote that is just barely keeping Biden above water.

Bloomberg, who signaled his intention to jump into the crowded Democrat primary field this week by filing paperwork to appear on the ballot in Arkansas’ March 3 presidential primary, is failing to see any sort of significant support nationally, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The poll, which surveyed 2,235 adults between November 12–14, 2019, showed only three percent of Democrats and independents supporting the former New York City mayor.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) led in support with 19 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 13 percent. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) followed with six percent support, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) fell to three percent, tying with Bloomberg despite a months-long presence in the race.

The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less:

More on the methodology:

The sample includes 958 Democrats, 848 Republicans, and 249 independents. Weighting was then employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample’s composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The precision of Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within ± 2.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Americans been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error. The poll also has a credibility interval ± 3.6 percentage points for Democrats, ± 3.8 percentage points for Republicans ± 7.1 percentage points for independents.

Bloomberg has not received a warm welcome from Democrats, particularly from Warren or Sanders. Most recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) took a veiled swipe at Bloomberg as well as other Democrats, who appear to be joining the race at the last minute.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday released her plan to transition the United States to her $52 trillion Medicare for All program, notably holding off on ending private insurance right off the bat and making it part of her second legislative push, which she claims will occur before the end of her first term.

Warren unveiled her Medicare for All plan in a Medium post this month, proclaiming, proudly, that the multitrillion-dollar plan would not require a tax hike on middle class Americans, even though experts state that it would. Rather, Warren claims she will pay for the plan, in part, via an additional tax hike on the wealthy, cuts on defense spending, and amnesty.

The presidential hopeful added to her plan on Friday, explaining how she would transition the country to a Medicare for All system. While she claims the transition would occur entirely in her first term, its enactment would occur under two legislative pushes. She describes the first as a “fast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that’s free for tens of millions”:

Today, I'm sharing my plan to transition to #MedicareForAll. In my first term, we will reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower drug prices, lower the Medicare age to 50 and create a true Medicare for All option—and fully transition to #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/ZErB1evhnC — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

Her plan states:

Coverage under the new Medicare for All option will be immediately free for children under the age of 18 and for families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (about $51,000 for a family of four). For all others, the cost will be modest, and eventually, coverage under this plan will be free for everyone.

Then, “no later” than her third year in office, Warren would “fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All,” essentially eliminating the need for private insurance:

By this point, the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company. Per the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn’t duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs.

Warren believes that the methodical, step by step approach will result in “millions” of Americans paying less in health care and claims they will see the “quality of their current health coverage improve.”

“And millions more Americans will have the choice to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality public plan,” her plan states, reiterating that it will not result in an increased tax burden for middle class families.

“And, at each step, the changes in our health care system will be fully paid for without raising taxes one penny on middle class families,” her plan claims.

“Let’s not kid ourselves: every Democratic plan for expanding public health care coverage is a challenge to these industries’ bottom lines – and every one of these plans is already being drowned in money to make sure it never happens,” Warren wrote, adding in a jab to two of her fiercest Democrat critics, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D).

“Any candidate who believes more modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention,” she warned.

Warren confirmed at a town hall meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, this month that her Medicare for All plan will also cover illegal immigrants.

“Medicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that’s it,” Warren told the crowd:"

Buttigieg is running… [+1363 chars]",CNN released a new Iowa poll Saturday night about the 2020 Democratic candidates. Follow here for live analysis.,2019-11-17,CNN,CNN's latest Iowa poll: Live analysis on Buttigieg surging to first place,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-poll-11-16-2019/index.html,"If there is one lesson you should take from the dramatic shifts in our Iowa polls over the last two months, it's that things are volatile.

Although a higher percentage of caucusgoers say their mind is made up (30%) now than in September (20%), 69% say they either don't have a first choice or could be persuaded to vote a different way.

There are seven candidates with favorable ratings over 50%.

When you look to history, leaders in Buttigieg's position have lost many times. In caucuses without an incumbent running, the leader in the Iowa polls at this point have only gone on to win the caucuses three of the last nine times since 2000. That means they have lost more often than they have won.

This is especially the case when the leader was polling below 49% like Buttigieg is currently. In each of these six cases, the Iowa polling leader at this point since 2000 went on to lose the caucuses -- and they went on to lose the nomination as well.

Now, that doesn't mean Buttigieg is destined to lose or anything like that. Rather, it's an indication that a lead at this point doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot when there are a slew of well-liked candidates not too far behind."

5. Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment: The steady drumbeat of the 2020 campaign isn't coming from Iowa or New Hampshire. It's coming from Washington and, specifically, Capitol Hill, where the second week of public impeachment hearings is packed with potential problems for President Donald Trump.

There are five hearings featuring eight total witnesses scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- a massive increase from the three witnesses over two hearings last week.

The two big(gest) ones to watch:

*National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman, who was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and has testified behind closed doors that he believed the conversation was inappropriate and immediately alerted his superior to that fact. Vindman will testify publicly Tuesday morning.

*Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify Wednesday morning in what will be the most-watched (and potentially most consequential) of the week's testimony. Sondland has been identified as taking a call with Trump on July 26 to convey that the Ukrainians were ready to announce an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Sondland also revised his original closed-door testimony to note that he had, in early September, told a top Ukrainian official that the hold-up of nearly $400 million in US military aid was directly due to the lack of an announcement of a Biden investigation. (There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.)

If this week on the impeachment front is as bad as last week -- and there is every indication it will be -- Trump will be in a world of hurt.

4. Kamala's collapse continues: The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new CNN/Des Moines Register pol l, it isn't working; Harris is at 3% with a bunch of other longer-shot candidates.)

That external turmoil is reportedly mirrored by internal fighting, with fingers being pointed at Harris' campaign manager, according to terrific reporting by Politico's Christopher Cadelago . Cadelago writes in a devastating piece on Harris' campaign:

""As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez.""

Having seen a lot of presidential candidacies over my time covering this stuff (aka I am old), I can say unequivocally that this is how campaigns end. Money problems, poll problems and, finally, the blame game. Harris has already qualified for this week's debate (much more on that below) and the next debate in December, but I'm skeptical she can hold on for another week with this current trajectory.

3. Trump's health questions: On Saturday, President Trump made an On Saturday, President Trump made an unscheduled and unannounced visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to undergo a ""quick exam and labs"" that was, according to the White House, part of his annual physical. ""Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, DC, to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed,"" explained White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.

Trump echoed that sentiment in a tweet Sunday morning , casting the visit as ""phase one of my yearly physical"" and pronouncing that ""everything very good (great!).""

But given a) the unscheduled nature of the trip b) the fact that his two previous yearly physical exams were on his official calendar and announced to the media and c) the fact that Trump is 73, it seems as though more questions will (and should) be asked about what exactly happened on Saturday.

All of those questions -- why was it an unannounced visit, why did he start his physical less than a year after his last one, etc. -- may well be easily answered to everyone's satisfaction. But given the way Trump obfuscated about his health as a candidate -- Dr. Harold Bornstein, anyone? -- they are questions that should be answered by this White House.

And then there is the fact that Trump -- in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton and again in 2020 targeting potential rival Joe Biden -- has sought to raise questions about his opponents' mental and physical heath. To insufficiently answer questions about his own health would seem to be, in a word, hypocritical.

2. A new Iowa front-runner: It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll proves just how much momentum the man they call Mayor Pete has.

Buttigieg has a 9-point lead over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a 10-point edge over both Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Which is remarkable given that Buttigieg was entirely unknown in the state as recently as a year ago.

What's more remarkable -- and more worrisome for Buttigieg's rivals -- is the trend line in Iowa for the mayor. Buttigieg is up 16 percentage points since a September CNN/DMR poll while both Warren (down 6 points) and Biden (down 5 points) lost support over that time. (Sanders gained 4 points from September to today.)

And Buttigieg's approval numbers suggest he will be difficult to topple in the remaining months before the Iowa caucuses. Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) have a favorable view of Mayor Pete while just 16% have an unfavorable one. That's both the highest favorable number and the lowest unfavorable number in the field. Plus, the 42% who said they feel ""very"" favorably toward Buttigieg is rivaled only by the 36% who say the same of Warren.

1. It's starting to get late in the debates: On Wednesday in Atlanta, 10 Democratic candidates will take the stage at Tyler Perry Studios. For eight of them, it will be their fifth debate of the primary season. For one -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- it will be her fourth. (Gabbard did not qualify for the August debate.) And for billionaire Tom Steyer, it will be his second (straight) debate -- after a late entry in the field causes him to miss the first three set-to's.

While more debates remain before the first vote in Iowa, this week's debate feels like the last best chance for the second-tier (and below) candidates to begin building the momentum they need to seriously challenge for the nomination.

Case in point: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She is at 6% in the most recent CNN/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa -- behind the front-running four but above the low single-digit crowd. Klobuchar has been solid in the debates to date but has struggled to build momentum coming off of her above-average performances. She's running out of time -- and needs to find a way to distinguish herself (and turn that into votes) in this debate.

No matter what happens, Klobuchar will have another debate in December. (She is one of six candidates who have already qualified for the Los Angeles debate.) Which makes the stakes for her high but not as high as the four candidates on stage Wednesday who haven't qualified for next month's debate yet : New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and technologist Andrew Yang as well as Steyer and Gabbard.

Booker may be in the most tenuous place of those four, as the New Jersey Democrat entered the 2020 race with high expectations that he simply has not met. Unless Booker has a standout performance Wednesday, he may well miss the next debate. And if someone of his stature is missing a debate two months before thew actual vote, it's hard to justify staying in the race."

The Douglass Plan, named for the (Republican) former slave and abolitionist, proposes a variety of policies aimed at helping black Americans, alongside a committee to study the issue of reparations, which Buttigieg also backs.

The plan is partly aimed at addressing Buttigieg’s persistent weakness among black voters, which is partly the result of difficulties in his relationship with the black community in South Bend. He fired the city’s first black police chief, then faced criticism from the black community after an officer-involved shooting earlier this year. When he tried to make amends by accusing the police department of racism, he faced criticism from law enforcement as well.

As The Intercept reported Friday (original links):

When pressed on the lack of black support, Buttigieg and his campaign have made repeated references to the Douglass Plan, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass. “Our response to those who ask what our agenda for black America is, is the Douglass Plan.” Buttigieg said recently on CNN. “It is the most comprehensive vision put forward by a 2020 candidate on the question of how we’re going to tackle systemic racism in this country.” … The campaign hasn’t publicly claimed that every supporter of the plan listed is African American, though it wouldn’t be hard to draw that implication: It was published in the HBCU Times, and the bylines and top-listed supporters are all black. To be sure, a multiracial coalition would be needed to push the Douglass Plan through Congress, but the campaign didn’t say that, either. After publication, the Buttigieg campaign said it had sent the plan to the list of supporters and asked them to opt out if they did not want their name included on the list. That email also specified that the list was meant to represent “over 400 Black South Carolinians.”

In an email sent by the campaign, Buttigieg touted support from 400 black South Carolinians, according to Slate.

But as The Intercept reported, not all of those who signed on were black — and not all who signed on were aware that they had. Three of the signatories, one of whom has already endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), were shocked to see that the Buttigieg campaign was touting their support when they had not, in fact, backed the plan.

Moreover:

Whatever the intent, a review of the 422 names on the list of supporters finds that at least 297 of them appear in the South Carolina voter file. … But for 184 of them, the voter file lists either one name, or lists multiple people, all of whom self-identify as white — so at least 42 percent of the entire list is white. And that means 62 percent of the 297 names that can be reliably checked are white.

Other names, the Intercept reported, are repeated, or are from outside the U.S.

Slate published the Buttigieg campaign’s response to the story, claiming it never meant to mislead anyone — but revealing that it had used an “opt-out” process, rather than specifically asking “supporters” to opt into the plan:

In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren’t comfortable being listed and we removed them.

Moreover, according to the Intercept’s Ryan Grim, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan:

Bloomberg has not received a warm welcome from Democrats, particularly from Warren or Sanders. Most recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) took a veiled swipe at Bloomberg as well as other Democrats, who appear to be joining the race at the last minute.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday released her plan to transition the United States to her $52 trillion Medicare for All program, notably holding off on ending private insurance right off the bat and making it part of her second legislative push, which she claims will occur before the end of her first term.

Warren unveiled her Medicare for All plan in a Medium post this month, proclaiming, proudly, that the multitrillion-dollar plan would not require a tax hike on middle class Americans, even though experts state that it would. Rather, Warren claims she will pay for the plan, in part, via an additional tax hike on the wealthy, cuts on defense spending, and amnesty.

The presidential hopeful added to her plan on Friday, explaining how she would transition the country to a Medicare for All system. While she claims the transition would occur entirely in her first term, its enactment would occur under two legislative pushes. She describes the first as a “fast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that’s free for tens of millions”:

Today, I'm sharing my plan to transition to #MedicareForAll. In my first term, we will reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower drug prices, lower the Medicare age to 50 and create a true Medicare for All option—and fully transition to #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/ZErB1evhnC — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 15, 2019

Her plan states:

Coverage under the new Medicare for All option will be immediately free for children under the age of 18 and for families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (about $51,000 for a family of four). For all others, the cost will be modest, and eventually, coverage under this plan will be free for everyone.

Then, “no later” than her third year in office, Warren would “fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All,” essentially eliminating the need for private insurance:

By this point, the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company. Per the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn’t duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs.

Warren believes that the methodical, step by step approach will result in “millions” of Americans paying less in health care and claims they will see the “quality of their current health coverage improve.”

“And millions more Americans will have the choice to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality public plan,” her plan states, reiterating that it will not result in an increased tax burden for middle class families.

“And, at each step, the changes in our health care system will be fully paid for without raising taxes one penny on middle class families,” her plan claims.

“Let’s not kid ourselves: every Democratic plan for expanding public health care coverage is a challenge to these industries’ bottom lines – and every one of these plans is already being drowned in money to make sure it never happens,” Warren wrote, adding in a jab to two of her fiercest Democrat critics, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D).

“Any candidate who believes more modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention,” she warned.

Warren confirmed at a town hall meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, this month that her Medicare for All plan will also cover illegal immigrants.

“Medicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that’s it,” Warren told the crowd:"

Mike Rounds Pushes EB-5 Visa Bill Which Aids Chinese, Indian Migrants, Coastal Cities",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/17/gop-sen-mike-rounds-pushes-eb-5-visa-bill-to-aid-chinese-migrants-and-coastal-cities/,"South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds has drafted a bill that would help wealthy Chinese buy citizenship — and would also help steer investment away from the heartland states towards the increasingly wealthy states on the coasts.

The giveaway for the wealthy Chinese lenders is buried on page 85 of Rounds’ draft bill, which offers a “parole” shortcut around the backlog of Chinese who are now waiting in line for EB-5 green cards:

The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary’s discretion, may temporarily parole into the United States, under such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, any alien who is the beneficiary of a petition for immigrant status [once] 3 years or more have elapsed since the petition was filed.

This parole language gives a citizenship shortcut to the foreigners who lend money to the U.S. real-estate industry in exchange for green cards via the EB-5 program. The program is such a giveaway that 73,000 foreigners have joined the line for the annual distribution of 10,000 green-card tickets to citizenship.

But the EB-5 law includes individual “country caps” to help diversify the award of green cards. These country caps have some flexibility, but the rush of lenders means that Chinese who sign up in late 2019 face a 17-year wait to get their cards, while Indians must wait nine years for their cards.

The long waits make it difficult for the U.S. real-estate industry to sell more EB-5 green cards to Indians or Chinese lenders.

Rounds’ bill will fix that real-estate funding problem by allowing Chinese and Indians lenders to skip their waiting lines after just three years if they get “parole” from the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

The foreigners have an obvious strategy to get parole: Persuade Rounds and other legislators to pressure the DHS secretary until the secretary quietly approves the parole requests.

Congress has already used the same indirect strategy to import more H-2B visa-workers for executives in the landscaping industry.

Rounds’ bill is also co-sponsored by Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn and South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham.

It is not clear if the three legislators will push the EB-5 bill up for a vote, or if they will try to attach it to a must-pass bill late in the year. The bill may only be a symbolic signal of support to interest groups, such as Cornyn’s Texas donors, during the run-up to the 2020 election year.

The bill also may have been drafted an alternative Sen. Mike Lee’s S.386 bill, which removes the “country caps” to reward the Chinese and India EB-5 lenders. But Lee’s bill is opposed by populists who say it encourages Indian graduates to take Americans’ college-jobs, and by Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin, who wants to raise immigration levels.

NC GOP @SenThomTillis wants to reward India's workers who take US jobs from American graduates. He's backing @SenMikeLee's @S386 bill which gives citizenship to Indians for taking Americans' jobs. Big subsidy for US investors, big loss for NC graduates. https://t.co/LWeAMULh0C — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 7, 2019

Rounds’ bill also overrides new regulations that pressure foreigners to lend their EB-5 funds to projects in low-income districts.

The new regulations were adopted because most EB-5 loans have gone to building projects in California, New Jersey, or New York.

The regulations will be issued on November 21 by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. The USCIS rules allow lenders to get visas for loaning just $900,000 to projects in lower-income zones, dubbed “targeted employment areas.” Outside the TEAs, lenders must lend $1.8 million to get their visas.

David North at the Center for Immigration Studies described how Rounds gets around the USCIS reforms:

The first 60 or so pages of this 87-page bill are filled with attractive material … Then, on p. 67, we learn that in addition to the precisely defined targeted employment areas (TEAs) of the regulations set to take effect this month — which is where the moneys are to be invested — middlemen will be allowed to place the investments in “qualified opportunity zones” created under another federal law, which are subject to easy manipulation by the middlemen and their allies in state government.

An October meeting of the EB-5 industry included a panel on the “qualified opportunity zones.”

EB-5 has been around since 1990; Opportunity Zones only since 2017. OZs are designated census tracts in which federal tax liabilities on real estate gains are deferred or eliminated under certain conditions, such as a holding period of seven to ten years … This panel will explore how the two programs can be combined to improve the viability and profitability of the underlying EB-5 development project.

Rounds’ bill also apparently reduces the incentives for investors to put their money into lower income areas. On page 87, his bill cuts the loan requirement for normal, non-poor locations to just $1.1 million, down from the $1.8 million in the USCIS regulations. But Rounds’ bill sets the price for TEA areas at $1 million. This shift means his bill offers only a $100,000 incentive for lenders to put their money into lower-income areas.

Rounds’ staff did not respond to emails from Breitbart News.

But the EB-5 bill is just one small part of a much larger Washington policy that is widening the wealth gap between coastal and heartland states.

For roughly 30 years, immigration has supercharged the economic growth in the coastal states. The huge supply of visa workers and legal immigrants arriving at Los Angeles International airport, for example, means that California investors can ignore the pool of American labor in heartland states. The coastal investors can fund new job creation centers close to their neighborhoods, and fill those jobs with the legal immigrants who arrive daily from India, Africa, South America, and Asia.

The flow of government supplied labor denies jobs, investments, opportunities, and wealth to many Americans in slower-growing, lower-priced, interior towns. States, communities, and families expend a huge effort to birth, rear, and educate millions of young Americans — but coastal investors can simply hire the imported workers from around the world.

The shift in power from families to investors — and the resulting regional wealth gap — is spotlighted by a 2018 report from the Economic Innovation Group, “From Great Recession to Great Reshuffling”:

The number of people living in prosperous zip codes swelled by 10.2 million between the two periods to a total of 86.5 million—more than any other quintile. Meanwhile, the number of Americans living in distressed zip codes fell by 3.4 million between the two periods to a total of 50 million—the smallest population of any quintile. … While the overall population in distressed zip codes declined, the number of rural Americans in that category increased by nearly 1 million between the two periods. Rural zip codes exhibited the most volatility and were by far the most likely to be downwardly mobile on the index, with 30 percent dropping into a lower quintile of prosperity—nearly twice the proportion of urban zip codes that fell into a lower quintile.

The same geographic skew is visible in investment deals tracked by the PricewaterhouseCoopers firm, according to a report at SSTI.org:

Once again, more than three-quarters of U.S. venture capital (VC) dollars went to companies in California, New York and Massachusetts in 2016, according to data from the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)/CB Insights’ Moneytree Report Explorer. Approximately 53.3 percent of all VC capital went to California companies … Massachusetts increased from 9.7 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2016; and New York increased from 10.6 percent in 2015 to 12.7 percent in 2016.

The inflow of immigrants matches the wealth shift from the heartland and to coasts, according to data in a 2018 report by the Center for Immigration Studies:

The states with the largest numerical increases since 2010 were Florida (up 721,298); Texas (up 712,109); California (up 502,985); New York (up 242,769); New Jersey (up 210,481); Washington (up 173,891); Massachusetts (up 172,908); Pennsylvania (up 154,701); Virginia (up 151,251); Maryland (up 124,241); Georgia (123,009); Michigan (up 116,059); North Carolina (up 110,279); and Minnesota (up 107,760).

This immigration inflow and job investment also shape the value of housing. In Virginia, for example, a home sale generates $95,000 in extra economic activity, according to the National Association of Realtors. But a home sale generates only $69,000 in South Dakota, the association reports.

Pete Buttigieg wants to stop the loss of people from small-town American by importing more immigrants. But the 'cure' is the problem: Immigration is helping to drain the heartland of people by subsidizing the creation of jobs & wealth in coastal cities. https://t.co/VOm9EYm4gI — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 14, 2019

Rounds’ DACA and prioritization double amnesty won 54 votes, putting it just shy of the 60-vote threshold because nearly all Democrats voted for the amnesty. The bill might have passed the Senate but for strong opposition from President Donald Trump and the officials at the Department of Homeland Security. Their criticism reportedly deterred several additional business first Republicans from pushing the bill up above the threshold of 60 votes. “The administration made it difficult for some [Republicans] to try to publicly support anything,” one Republican senator told Politico.

Rounds is touting his bill despite his prior entanglement in an EB-5 scandal. The Rapid City Journal reported November 8:"
145,,"South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the clear leader with 25% in the latest CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. He's up from a mere 9% in our September poll, 15% in June and 1% in March.

Follow here for live analysis.,2019-11-17,CNN,CNN's latest Iowa poll: Live analysis on Buttigieg surging to first place,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-poll-11-16-2019/index.html,"If there is one lesson you should take from the dramatic shifts in our Iowa polls over the last two months, it's that things are volatile.

Although a higher percentage of caucusgoers say their mind is made up (30%) now than in September (20%), 69% say they either don't have a first choice or could be persuaded to vote a different way.

There are seven candidates with favorable ratings over 50%.

When you look to history, leaders in Buttigieg's position have lost many times. In caucuses without an incumbent running, the leader in the Iowa polls at this point have only gone on to win the caucuses three of the last nine times since 2000. That means they have lost more often than they have won.

This is especially the case when the leader was polling below 49% like Buttigieg is currently. In each of these six cases, the Iowa polling leader at this point since 2000 went on to lose the caucuses -- and they went on to lose the nomination as well.

Now, that doesn't mean Buttigieg is destined to lose or anything like that. Rather, it's an indication that a lead at this point doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot when there are a slew of well-liked candidates not too far behind."

5. Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment: The steady drumbeat of the 2020 campaign isn't coming from Iowa or New Hampshire. It's coming from Washington and, specifically, Capitol Hill, where the second week of public impeachment hearings is packed with potential problems for President Donald Trump.

There are five hearings featuring eight total witnesses scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- a massive increase from the three witnesses over two hearings last week.

The two big(gest) ones to watch:

*National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman, who was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and has testified behind closed doors that he believed the conversation was inappropriate and immediately alerted his superior to that fact. Vindman will testify publicly Tuesday morning.

*Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify Wednesday morning in what will be the most-watched (and potentially most consequential) of the week's testimony. Sondland has been identified as taking a call with Trump on July 26 to convey that the Ukrainians were ready to announce an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Sondland also revised his original closed-door testimony to note that he had, in early September, told a top Ukrainian official that the hold-up of nearly $400 million in US military aid was directly due to the lack of an announcement of a Biden investigation. (There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.)

If this week on the impeachment front is as bad as last week -- and there is every indication it will be -- Trump will be in a world of hurt.

4. Kamala's collapse continues: The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new The slow-motion disaster of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign has been hard to watch. The California senator has gone from one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination this summer to being forced to run a last-ditch, Iowa-only candidacy today. And according to the brand new CNN/Des Moines Register pol l, it isn't working; Harris is at 3% with a bunch of other longer-shot candidates.)

That external turmoil is reportedly mirrored by internal fighting, with fingers being pointed at Harris' campaign manager, according to terrific reporting by Politico's Christopher Cadelago . Cadelago writes in a devastating piece on Harris' campaign:

""As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez.""

Having seen a lot of presidential candidacies over my time covering this stuff (aka I am old), I can say unequivocally that this is how campaigns end. Money problems, poll problems and, finally, the blame game. Harris has already qualified for this week's debate (much more on that below) and the next debate in December, but I'm skeptical she can hold on for another week with this current trajectory.

3. Trump's health questions: On Saturday, President Trump made an On Saturday, President Trump made an unscheduled and unannounced visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to undergo a ""quick exam and labs"" that was, according to the White House, part of his annual physical. ""Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, DC, to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed,"" explained White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.

Trump echoed that sentiment in a tweet Sunday morning , casting the visit as ""phase one of my yearly physical"" and pronouncing that ""everything very good (great!).""

But given a) the unscheduled nature of the trip b) the fact that his two previous yearly physical exams were on his official calendar and announced to the media and c) the fact that Trump is 73, it seems as though more questions will (and should) be asked about what exactly happened on Saturday.

All of those questions -- why was it an unannounced visit, why did he start his physical less than a year after his last one, etc. -- may well be easily answered to everyone's satisfaction. But given the way Trump obfuscated about his health as a candidate -- Dr. Harold Bornstein, anyone? -- they are questions that should be answered by this White House.

And then there is the fact that Trump -- in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton and again in 2020 targeting potential rival Joe Biden -- has sought to raise questions about his opponents' mental and physical heath. To insufficiently answer questions about his own health would seem to be, in a word, hypocritical.

2. A new Iowa front-runner: It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the It's been clear for weeks now that South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in the midst of a second major surge in the race. (Buttigieg's first surge this spring took him for nowhere to the top tier.) Now, the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll proves just how much momentum the man they call Mayor Pete has.

Buttigieg has a 9-point lead over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a 10-point edge over both Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Which is remarkable given that Buttigieg was entirely unknown in the state as recently as a year ago.

What's more remarkable -- and more worrisome for Buttigieg's rivals -- is the trend line in Iowa for the mayor. Buttigieg is up 16 percentage points since a September CNN/DMR poll while both Warren (down 6 points) and Biden (down 5 points) lost support over that time. (Sanders gained 4 points from September to today.)

And Buttigieg's approval numbers suggest he will be difficult to topple in the remaining months before the Iowa caucuses. Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) have a favorable view of Mayor Pete while just 16% have an unfavorable one. That's both the highest favorable number and the lowest unfavorable number in the field. Plus, the 42% who said they feel ""very"" favorably toward Buttigieg is rivaled only by the 36% who say the same of Warren.

1. It's starting to get late in the debates: On Wednesday in Atlanta, 10 Democratic candidates will take the stage at Tyler Perry Studios. For eight of them, it will be their fifth debate of the primary season. For one -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- it will be her fourth. (Gabbard did not qualify for the August debate.) And for billionaire Tom Steyer, it will be his second (straight) debate -- after a late entry in the field causes him to miss the first three set-to's.

While more debates remain before the first vote in Iowa, this week's debate feels like the last best chance for the second-tier (and below) candidates to begin building the momentum they need to seriously challenge for the nomination.

Case in point: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She is at 6% in the most recent CNN/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa -- behind the front-running four but above the low single-digit crowd. Klobuchar has been solid in the debates to date but has struggled to build momentum coming off of her above-average performances. She's running out of time -- and needs to find a way to distinguish herself (and turn that into votes) in this debate.

No matter what happens, Klobuchar will have another debate in December. (She is one of six candidates who have already qualified for the Los Angeles debate.) Which makes the stakes for her high but not as high as the four candidates on stage Wednesday who haven't qualified for next month's debate yet : New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and technologist Andrew Yang as well as Steyer and Gabbard.

Booker may be in the most tenuous place of those four, as the New Jersey Democrat entered the 2020 race with high expectations that he simply has not met. Unless Booker has a standout performance Wednesday, he may well miss the next debate. And if someone of his stature is missing a debate two months before thew actual vote, it's hard to justify staying in the race."

And given his poor fundraising through the end of September and his, uh, middling debate performances, there are some real facts behind that perception.

But one of the under-told storylines of the 2020 campaign to date is that despite the defeatist conventional wisdom, the support for the former vice president has -- and continues -- to show surprising resilience. That's especially true of Biden's support among African Americans, a critical voting bloc in a Democratic presidential primary.

Two polls released Monday out of South Carolina tell that story. In a Quinnipiac University poll , Biden is at 33% with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a distant second at 13%. A University of North Florida poll showed much the same -- Biden at 36% with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lagging well behind at 10% each.

Among black voters in the Quinnipiac poll, Biden took 44% to 10% for Sanders and just 8% for Warren. (South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg received less than 1% of the black vote in South Carolina in the new Q poll. Ouch.)

Of the UNF poll, Dr. Michael Binder, faculty director of the Public Opinion Research Lab, said : ""Buoyed by his support among African American voters, Biden has an established lead far above the other contenders in South Carolina.""

1. Fresno shooting

A shooting at a football watch party in Fresno yesterday ended with four people dead, six others wounded and very few answers as to who's responsible. Authorities say an unknown suspect walked into the yard of a home and began shooting into a crowd. There's no indication the suspect knew anyone there, and police haven't published any details about the suspect's appearance or a possible vehicle description. After the shooting, officers were going door to door to collect security camera footage and possible witness statements to get more information.

2. Impeachment investigation

The impeachment drama doesn't even stop on the weekends anymore. President Trump spent part of yesterday tweeting attacks against Jennifer Williams, an aid to Vice President Mike Pence who said in a deposition that Trump's July 25th call with Ukraine was ""inappropriate."" Williams is one of the people set to testify publicly this week, and the latest witness to face attacks from the President for her cooperation in the investigation. On Saturday, House impeachment investigators released a transcript of Williams' closed door deposition , as well as the deposition transcripts from Gordon Sondland, the American envoy to the European Union; and former NSC official Tim Morrison. The big takeaway from these releases: Morrison's account seems to corroborate Sondland's claim that he was directed by President Trump in his dealings with Ukraine, including an insistence that the country open investigations into the Biden family.

3. Hong Kong

It was a weekend of intense battles and prolonged standoffs between police and protesters in Hong Kong. Protesters are still holing up in some of the city's biggest universities , and police are hoping to wait them out. At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, anywhere from 100 to 1,000 protesters remain inside despite police orders to leave. Some protesters have been reluctant to come out of the university for fear of being beaten and arrested by police -- which happened to another group that fled earlier in the day. Meanwhile, some pro-democracy politicians in the city are upset after members of the Chinese military were spotted cleaning up Hong Kong's protest-marred streets. The politicians want to know if Hong Kong's government requested public security and disaster relief assistance from China in response to the ongoing violence.

5. Prince Andrew

Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, sat for an interview with the BBC about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and...yikes, it did not go well. The Prince referred to Epstein's history of sexual assault as him conducting himself ""in a manner unbecoming"" and revealed Epstein was invited to the 18th birthday party of the Prince's daughter , Princess Beatrice, even though Epstein was at the time subject to an arrest warrant for the sexual assault of a minor. For context, one of Epstein's accusers said in 2015 that Epstein forced her to perform sex acts with several prominent men when she was 17, including Prince Andrew. All of them have denied the allegations. This latest interview was the first time Prince Andrew has spoken publicly about the allegations, and the result drew almost universal condemnation. One British journalist said the interview was ""a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.""

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The American political debate over health care is absurd. Americans pay twice as much as any other nation for health care, and then are told daily that they ""can't afford"" to switch to a lower-cost system very similar to those of Canada and Europe. If President Donald Trump and the plutocratic Republican party were the only ones carrying this ridiculous message, it would be understandable. Yet this message is also coming from media pundits aligned with the Democratic Party and the most conservative wing of the party.

Let's be clear on the central point. Medicare for All, as first proposed by Bernie Sanders and endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, is affordable precisely because it is cheaper , much cheaper, than the current system.

America's health care system relies on local monopolies (such as a health care provider centered at the sole major hospital in a city) and national monopolies, notably pharmaceutical companies holding exclusive patents.

In other countries, the government sets delivery prices and typically pays the health bills through the budget. In the US, the monopolists set the prices.

The sky-high revenues end up as huge corporate profits, wasteful administrative costs, useless and even harmful advertising and lavish salaries. Health care CEOs are making gargantuan salaries , many exceeding $10 million per year.

Who loses? Almost all Americans, whose insurance costs and out-of-pocket outlays inevitably lead to lower income because of unaffordable health care costs, untreated chronic illnesses, premature mortality and personal bankruptcies. Single-payer systems such as in Canada and Europe are cheaper, fairer and have better outcomes.

A recent international comparison of the performance of 11 national health systems on five main dimensions (care process, access, efficiency, equity and health care outcomes) ranked the US health system dead last.

Despite all of this, the US pundits profess to be alarmed about the prospect of Medicare for All. There has been a wave of op-eds and columns published (for example, here and here and here ) declaring that Medicare for All would lead to massive tax increases, and that Sanders' and Warren's support for Medicare for All threatens to reelect Trump. It's ridiculous.

Both Sanders and Warren poll well against Trump, ahead in the overall popular vote (though like all Democrats, facing headwinds of the Electoral College).

And at this stage of a national campaign, the goal should be to explain to voters the vast benefits of a single-payer system rather than to prejudge the politics based on self-fulfilling fearmongering.

Yes, one way or another, taxes would rise with Medicare for All, but private health outlays would go down by much more. Total health costs would fall.

That idea is not so hard to understand.

One influential pundit, economist Paul Krugman, has come around . In the 2016 election cycle, Krugman railed against Medicare for All. Yet after Warren laid out her proposal, Krugman supported Medicare for All. In truth, he was simply returning to the economically sound observations that he had long made before 2016.

The pundits seem to believe that Americans will rebel at ""higher taxes."" Actually, Americans are much smarter than that. They know that their current private health care payments, whether insurance premiums or out-of-pocket, are nothing other than ""taxes"" they pay to stay alive. They'll agree to pay higher taxes to the government if those new taxes eliminate larger private health care bills -- again, there are ""taxes"" by any other name -- that they now pay.

Some mainstream pundits are simply repeating what they hear from Democratic Party conservatives and centrists, the wing that has been dominant since Clinton's election in 1992. They are following the lead of Nancy Pelosi, Pete Buttigieg and others who are trashing Medicare for All.

What in the world are these leading Democratic Party politicians doing in opposing the transition to a fairer, more efficient and lower cost health care system? I would suggest it's not a lack of understanding. It's the power of campaign financing. These Democrats are funded by the status quo. The health sector contributed $265 million to federal campaigns in 2018, of which 56% went to Democrats. The sector spends nearly $500 million per year on lobbying. Money talks. Meanwhile, Americans go bankrupt or die early.

There remains the issue of the best way to raise budget revenues for Medicare for All. The basic answer is to use progressive taxation to fund the program. In this way, the nation as a whole will pay much less for health care and the vast majority of households will as well. The highest income households will end up paying a bit more because their funds will not only finance their own health care but will help to pay the health care costs of the poorest households as well.

Sanders rightly proposed a menu of options to pay for Medicare for All, including payroll and income taxation. Warren has proposed one specific approach: progressive taxes on the super-rich and the corporate sector but also a surprisingly regressive ""head tax"" on companies. She took great pride in not charging a penny of new income or payroll taxes on middle class households. But the proposed head tax on companies would hit wages indirectly and regressively.

Still, both Sanders' and Warrens' approaches would result in a more equitable and less expensive system. For most households, overall health care costs will decline.

The most worrisome thing about Warren's statement as she introduced her Medicare for All plan, is her emphasis on ""not one penny"" of new middle-class taxes. Here we go again. The Democrats have, for far too long, copied the Republican mantra about ""no new taxes,"" even as our public debt soars, our infrastructure and public services collapse and inequality reaches stratospheric dimensions.

To honor the silly stricture of ""no new taxes"" directly paid by middle-class households, Warren ended up endorsing a regressive head tax paid by the employer, which would end up hitting lower-wage workers even though its paid by their employers.

Let's hope this blunder is a one-time stumble for Warren. Most importantly, both Sanders and Warren are pointing the correct way to reform America's costly, unfair and inefficient health care system. And this is a goal that most Americans support."

New potential candidate former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg only has two percent.

Buttigieg softened some of his hard-left rhetoric in recent weeks, offering a health care plan that allowed Americans to choose whether they wanted a government health care plan or to stay on their private insurance.

Buttigieg was speaking at a Latino candidate forum after attending a convention of the state’s Democrats, whom he has been courting aggressively ahead of California’s March 3 primary, in Long Beach.

The Golden State, which has the largest delegate haul, has traditionally voted in June, but state leaders chose to shift it earlier to give voters a bigger role in determining the winner of presidential primaries.

Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn’t violate Mexico’s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn’t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically — do you see a time when troops can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation — as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partner south of the border.

Buttigieg seems to have missed the point of the question: that American lives are, in fact, on the line.

The Sacramento Bee reports that Buttigieg was the only candidate who faced a direct question about sending troops to Mexico.

Other candidates were sharply critical of Buttigieg’s remarks. Aggressive rhetoric about Mexico is taboo in the Democratic Party, ever since President Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on building a wall along the border — and making Mexico pay for it.

(Since then, Trump has ordered the military to build new portions of “wall” — heavy bollard fencing — along the border, over congressional objections, and secured an agreement with Mexico to place thousands of troops at its southern border, at its expense.)

Buttigieg remains in single digits in most nationwide polls, occupying fourth place, the first of the second-tier candidates, well behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the front of the pack. He is leading in recent polls in Iowa, however, and is focusing his resources in early primary states.

Meanwhile, delegates to the convention were reportedly suggesting that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) drop out, given that she is polling poorly in her own home state.

Harris has focused her campaign’s dwindling resources on Iowa, rather than on nearby Nevada, the third primary state, where she has a geographical advantage.

The Douglass Plan, named for the (Republican) former slave and abolitionist, proposes a variety of policies aimed at helping black Americans, alongside a committee to study the issue of reparations, which Buttigieg also backs.

The plan is partly aimed at addressing Buttigieg’s persistent weakness among black voters, which is partly the result of difficulties in his relationship with the black community in South Bend. He fired the city’s first black police chief, then faced criticism from the black community after an officer-involved shooting earlier this year. When he tried to make amends by accusing the police department of racism, he faced criticism from law enforcement as well.

As The Intercept reported Friday (original links):

When pressed on the lack of black support, Buttigieg and his campaign have made repeated references to the Douglass Plan, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass. “Our response to those who ask what our agenda for black America is, is the Douglass Plan.” Buttigieg said recently on CNN. “It is the most comprehensive vision put forward by a 2020 candidate on the question of how we’re going to tackle systemic racism in this country.” … The campaign hasn’t publicly claimed that every supporter of the plan listed is African American, though it wouldn’t be hard to draw that implication: It was published in the HBCU Times, and the bylines and top-listed supporters are all black. To be sure, a multiracial coalition would be needed to push the Douglass Plan through Congress, but the campaign didn’t say that, either. After publication, the Buttigieg campaign said it had sent the plan to the list of supporters and asked them to opt out if they did not want their name included on the list. That email also specified that the list was meant to represent “over 400 Black South Carolinians.”

In an email sent by the campaign, Buttigieg touted support from 400 black South Carolinians, according to Slate.

But as The Intercept reported, not all of those who signed on were black — and not all who signed on were aware that they had. Three of the signatories, one of whom has already endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), were shocked to see that the Buttigieg campaign was touting their support when they had not, in fact, backed the plan.

Moreover:

Whatever the intent, a review of the 422 names on the list of supporters finds that at least 297 of them appear in the South Carolina voter file. … But for 184 of them, the voter file lists either one name, or lists multiple people, all of whom self-identify as white — so at least 42 percent of the entire list is white. And that means 62 percent of the 297 names that can be reliably checked are white.

Other names, the Intercept reported, are repeated, or are from outside the U.S.

Slate published the Buttigieg campaign’s response to the story, claiming it never meant to mislead anyone — but revealing that it had used an “opt-out” process, rather than specifically asking “supporters” to opt into the plan:

In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we’ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren’t comfortable being listed and we removed them.

Moreover, according to the Intercept’s Ryan Grim, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan:

The latest poll in South Carolina has Buttigieg in a distant fourth place, at 8%, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads the field with 45%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at 17% and Sanders at 15%.

Biden made waves over the weekend after expressing skepticism of legalizing marijuana at the federal level, contending that there is “not nearly” enough evidence to definitively determine if it acts as a “gateway drug.”

“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden told an audience in Las Vegas, Nevada, over the weekend. “It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

“It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally,” he continued. “I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

The presidential hopeful’s remark sparked responses from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — who has vowed to legalize marijuana within the first 100 days in the office via executive order and create federal programs designed to help former convicts secure jobs in the marijuana industry — and his supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

The criminalization of marijuana has been a disaster. We are going to legalize it, expunge past convictions and invest in communities of color that have been devastated by the War on Drugs. https://t.co/0xQSHn6F3U — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 17, 2019

Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 18, 2019

Modine’s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats — Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion.

A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks.

The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren’s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.

The Biden campaign’s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful’s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter — a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren — and reported just $9 million cash on hand.

“His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,” as Breitbart News noted."

Mike Rounds Pushes EB-5 Visa Bill Which Aids Chinese, Indian Migrants, Coastal Cities",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/17/gop-sen-mike-rounds-pushes-eb-5-visa-bill-to-aid-chinese-migrants-and-coastal-cities/,"South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds has drafted a bill that would help wealthy Chinese buy citizenship — and would also help steer investment away from the heartland states towards the increasingly wealthy states on the coasts.

The giveaway for the wealthy Chinese lenders is buried on page 85 of Rounds’ draft bill, which offers a “parole” shortcut around the backlog of Chinese who are now waiting in line for EB-5 green cards:

The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary’s discretion, may temporarily parole into the United States, under such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, any alien who is the beneficiary of a petition for immigrant status [once] 3 years or more have elapsed since the petition was filed.

This parole language gives a citizenship shortcut to the foreigners who lend money to the U.S. real-estate industry in exchange for green cards via the EB-5 program. The program is such a giveaway that 73,000 foreigners have joined the line for the annual distribution of 10,000 green-card tickets to citizenship.

But the EB-5 law includes individual “country caps” to help diversify the award of green cards. These country caps have some flexibility, but the rush of lenders means that Chinese who sign up in late 2019 face a 17-year wait to get their cards, while Indians must wait nine years for their cards.

The long waits make it difficult for the U.S. real-estate industry to sell more EB-5 green cards to Indians or Chinese lenders.

Rounds’ bill will fix that real-estate funding problem by allowing Chinese and Indians lenders to skip their waiting lines after just three years if they get “parole” from the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

The foreigners have an obvious strategy to get parole: Persuade Rounds and other legislators to pressure the DHS secretary until the secretary quietly approves the parole requests.

Congress has already used the same indirect strategy to import more H-2B visa-workers for executives in the landscaping industry.

Rounds’ bill is also co-sponsored by Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn and South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham.

It is not clear if the three legislators will push the EB-5 bill up for a vote, or if they will try to attach it to a must-pass bill late in the year. The bill may only be a symbolic signal of support to interest groups, such as Cornyn’s Texas donors, during the run-up to the 2020 election year.

The bill also may have been drafted an alternative Sen. Mike Lee’s S.386 bill, which removes the “country caps” to reward the Chinese and India EB-5 lenders. But Lee’s bill is opposed by populists who say it encourages Indian graduates to take Americans’ college-jobs, and by Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin, who wants to raise immigration levels.

NC GOP @SenThomTillis wants to reward India's workers who take US jobs from American graduates. He's backing @SenMikeLee's @S386 bill which gives citizenship to Indians for taking Americans' jobs. Big subsidy for US investors, big loss for NC graduates. https://t.co/LWeAMULh0C — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 7, 2019

Rounds’ bill also overrides new regulations that pressure foreigners to lend their EB-5 funds to projects in low-income districts.

The new regulations were adopted because most EB-5 loans have gone to building projects in California, New Jersey, or New York.

The regulations will be issued on November 21 by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. The USCIS rules allow lenders to get visas for loaning just $900,000 to projects in lower-income zones, dubbed “targeted employment areas.” Outside the TEAs, lenders must lend $1.8 million to get their visas.

David North at the Center for Immigration Studies described how Rounds gets around the USCIS reforms:

The first 60 or so pages of this 87-page bill are filled with attractive material … Then, on p. 67, we learn that in addition to the precisely defined targeted employment areas (TEAs) of the regulations set to take effect this month — which is where the moneys are to be invested — middlemen will be allowed to place the investments in “qualified opportunity zones” created under another federal law, which are subject to easy manipulation by the middlemen and their allies in state government.

An October meeting of the EB-5 industry included a panel on the “qualified opportunity zones.”

EB-5 has been around since 1990; Opportunity Zones only since 2017. OZs are designated census tracts in which federal tax liabilities on real estate gains are deferred or eliminated under certain conditions, such as a holding period of seven to ten years … This panel will explore how the two programs can be combined to improve the viability and profitability of the underlying EB-5 development project.

Rounds’ bill also apparently reduces the incentives for investors to put their money into lower income areas. On page 87, his bill cuts the loan requirement for normal, non-poor locations to just $1.1 million, down from the $1.8 million in the USCIS regulations. But Rounds’ bill sets the price for TEA areas at $1 million. This shift means his bill offers only a $100,000 incentive for lenders to put their money into lower-income areas.

Rounds’ staff did not respond to emails from Breitbart News.

But the EB-5 bill is just one small part of a much larger Washington policy that is widening the wealth gap between coastal and heartland states.

For roughly 30 years, immigration has supercharged the economic growth in the coastal states. The huge supply of visa workers and legal immigrants arriving at Los Angeles International airport, for example, means that California investors can ignore the pool of American labor in heartland states. The coastal investors can fund new job creation centers close to their neighborhoods, and fill those jobs with the legal immigrants who arrive daily from India, Africa, South America, and Asia.

The flow of government supplied labor denies jobs, investments, opportunities, and wealth to many Americans in slower-growing, lower-priced, interior towns. States, communities, and families expend a huge effort to birth, rear, and educate millions of young Americans — but coastal investors can simply hire the imported workers from around the world.

The shift in power from families to investors — and the resulting regional wealth gap — is spotlighted by a 2018 report from the Economic Innovation Group, “From Great Recession to Great Reshuffling”:

The number of people living in prosperous zip codes swelled by 10.2 million between the two periods to a total of 86.5 million—more than any other quintile. Meanwhile, the number of Americans living in distressed zip codes fell by 3.4 million between the two periods to a total of 50 million—the smallest population of any quintile. … While the overall population in distressed zip codes declined, the number of rural Americans in that category increased by nearly 1 million between the two periods. Rural zip codes exhibited the most volatility and were by far the most likely to be downwardly mobile on the index, with 30 percent dropping into a lower quintile of prosperity—nearly twice the proportion of urban zip codes that fell into a lower quintile.

The same geographic skew is visible in investment deals tracked by the PricewaterhouseCoopers firm, according to a report at SSTI.org:

Once again, more than three-quarters of U.S. venture capital (VC) dollars went to companies in California, New York and Massachusetts in 2016, according to data from the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)/CB Insights’ Moneytree Report Explorer. Approximately 53.3 percent of all VC capital went to California companies … Massachusetts increased from 9.7 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2016; and New York increased from 10.6 percent in 2015 to 12.7 percent in 2016.

The inflow of immigrants matches the wealth shift from the heartland and to coasts, according to data in a 2018 report by the Center for Immigration Studies:

The states with the largest numerical increases since 2010 were Florida (up 721,298); Texas (up 712,109); California (up 502,985); New York (up 242,769); New Jersey (up 210,481); Washington (up 173,891); Massachusetts (up 172,908); Pennsylvania (up 154,701); Virginia (up 151,251); Maryland (up 124,241); Georgia (123,009); Michigan (up 116,059); North Carolina (up 110,279); and Minnesota (up 107,760).

This immigration inflow and job investment also shape the value of housing. In Virginia, for example, a home sale generates $95,000 in extra economic activity, according to the National Association of Realtors. But a home sale generates only $69,000 in South Dakota, the association reports.

Pete Buttigieg wants to stop the loss of people from small-town American by importing more immigrants. But the 'cure' is the problem: Immigration is helping to drain the heartland of people by subsidizing the creation of jobs & wealth in coastal cities. https://t.co/VOm9EYm4gI — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 14, 2019

Rounds’ DACA and prioritization double amnesty won 54 votes, putting it just shy of the 60-vote threshold because nearly all Democrats voted for the amnesty. The bill might have passed the Senate but for strong opposition from President Donald Trump and the officials at the Department of Homeland Security. Their criticism reportedly deterred several additional business first Republicans from pushing the bill up above the threshold of 60 votes. “The administration made it difficult for some [Republicans] to try to publicly support anything,” one Republican senator told Politico.

And given his poor fundraising through the end of September and his, uh, middling debate performances, there are some real facts behind that perception.

But one of the under-told storylines of the 2020 campaign to date is that despite the defeatist conventional wisdom, the support for the former vice president has -- and continues -- to show surprising resilience. That's especially true of Biden's support among African Americans, a critical voting bloc in a Democratic presidential primary.

Two polls released Monday out of South Carolina tell that story. In a Quinnipiac University poll , Biden is at 33% with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a distant second at 13%. A University of North Florida poll showed much the same -- Biden at 36% with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lagging well behind at 10% each.

Among black voters in the Quinnipiac poll, Biden took 44% to 10% for Sanders and just 8% for Warren. (South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg received less than 1% of the black vote in South Carolina in the new Q poll. Ouch.)

Of the UNF poll, Dr. Michael Binder, faculty director of the Public Opinion Research Lab, said : ""Buoyed by his support among African American voters, Biden has an established lead far above the other contenders in South Carolina.""

That sentiment is stronger among registered Republicans who do not plan to attend the Democratic caucuses, with 60% saying the impeachment inquiry is more likely to make it easier than harder (26%) for President Donald Trump to win re-election. Among likely Democratic caucusgoers, 45% say the inquiry would make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win in 2020 compared to 24% who believe it will make it harder. The share of those who say they are not sure what impact the inquiry will have is roughly the same across both voter groups.

For their part, likely Democratic caucusgoers are more likely to report following the impeachment proceedings than are registered Republicans. Nearly seven-in-10 likely Democratic caucusgoers say they are following the proceedings, including 46% indicating they were following them very closely. Of those following very or fairly closely, 52% say the proceedings will make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win the general election. That compares to just 36% of those who are following the inquiry somewhat closely or not at all who feel it will make it easier.

The findings come on the heels of the first week of public testimony in the inquiry with another eight witnesses slated to testify in open hearings this week. The poll was largely conducted before public hearings began.

When it comes to registered Republicans, 30% say they're following the inquiry very closely, with another 25% saying they're following them fairly closely. Among those Republicans following the proceedings very or fairly closely, 72% say they'll make it easier for Trump to win re-election, while just 46% of those who are tracking it somewhat closely or not at all say that's the case.

1. Fresno shooting

A shooting at a football watch party in Fresno yesterday ended with four people dead, six others wounded and very few answers as to who's responsible. Authorities say an unknown suspect walked into the yard of a home and began shooting into a crowd. There's no indication the suspect knew anyone there, and police haven't published any details about the suspect's appearance or a possible vehicle description. After the shooting, officers were going door to door to collect security camera footage and possible witness statements to get more information.

2. Impeachment investigation

The impeachment drama doesn't even stop on the weekends anymore. President Trump spent part of yesterday tweeting attacks against Jennifer Williams, an aid to Vice President Mike Pence who said in a deposition that Trump's July 25th call with Ukraine was ""inappropriate."" Williams is one of the people set to testify publicly this week, and the latest witness to face attacks from the President for her cooperation in the investigation. On Saturday, House impeachment investigators released a transcript of Williams' closed door deposition , as well as the deposition transcripts from Gordon Sondland, the American envoy to the European Union; and former NSC official Tim Morrison. The big takeaway from these releases: Morrison's account seems to corroborate Sondland's claim that he was directed by President Trump in his dealings with Ukraine, including an insistence that the country open investigations into the Biden family.

Protesters are still holing up in some of the city's biggest universities , and police are hoping to wait them out. At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, anywhere from 100 to 1,000 protesters remain inside despite police orders to leave. Some protesters have been reluctant to come out of the university for fear of being beaten and arrested by police -- which happened to another group that fled earlier in the day. Meanwhile, some pro-democracy politicians in the city are upset after members of the Chinese military were spotted cleaning up Hong Kong's protest-marred streets. The politicians want to know if Hong Kong's government requested public security and disaster relief assistance from China in response to the ongoing violence.

For context, one of Epstein's accusers said in 2015 that Epstein forced her to perform sex acts with several prominent men when she was 17, including Prince Andrew. All of them have denied the allegations. This latest interview was the first time Prince Andrew has spoken publicly about the allegations, and the result drew almost universal condemnation. One British journalist said the interview was ""a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.""

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The American political debate over health care is absurd. Americans pay twice as much as any other nation for health care, and then are told daily that they ""can't afford"" to switch to a lower-cost system very similar to those of Canada and Europe. If President Donald Trump and the plutocratic Republican party were the only ones carrying this ridiculous message, it would be understandable. Yet this message is also coming from media pundits aligned with the Democratic Party and the most conservative wing of the party.

Let's be clear on the central point. Medicare for All, as first proposed by Bernie Sanders and endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, is affordable precisely because it is cheaper , much cheaper, than the current system.

America's health care system relies on local monopolies (such as a health care provider centered at the sole major hospital in a city) and national monopolies, notably pharmaceutical companies holding exclusive patents.

In other countries, the government sets delivery prices and typically pays the health bills through the budget. In the US, the monopolists set the prices.

The sky-high revenues end up as huge corporate profits, wasteful administrative costs, useless and even harmful advertising and lavish salaries. Health care CEOs are making gargantuan salaries , many exceeding $10 million per year.

Who loses? Almost all Americans, whose insurance costs and out-of-pocket outlays inevitably lead to lower income because of unaffordable health care costs, untreated chronic illnesses, premature mortality and personal bankruptcies. Single-payer systems such as in Canada and Europe are cheaper, fairer and have better outcomes.

A recent international comparison of the performance of 11 national health systems on five main dimensions (care process, access, efficiency, equity and health care outcomes) ranked the US health system dead last.

Despite all of this, the US pundits profess to be alarmed about the prospect of Medicare for All. There has been a wave of op-eds and columns published (for example, here and here and here ) declaring that Medicare for All would lead to massive tax increases, and that Sanders' and Warren's support for Medicare for All threatens to reelect Trump. It's ridiculous.

Both Sanders and Warren poll well against Trump, ahead in the overall popular vote (though like all Democrats, facing headwinds of the Electoral College).

And at this stage of a national campaign, the goal should be to explain to voters the vast benefits of a single-payer system rather than to prejudge the politics based on self-fulfilling fearmongering.

Yes, one way or another, taxes would rise with Medicare for All, but private health outlays would go down by much more. Total health costs would fall.

That idea is not so hard to understand.

One influential pundit, economist Paul Krugman, has come around . In the 2016 election cycle, Krugman railed against Medicare for All. Yet after Warren laid out her proposal, Krugman supported Medicare for All. In truth, he was simply returning to the economically sound observations that he had long made before 2016.

The pundits seem to believe that Americans will rebel at ""higher taxes."" Actually, Americans are much smarter than that. They know that their current private health care payments, whether insurance premiums or out-of-pocket, are nothing other than ""taxes"" they pay to stay alive. They'll agree to pay higher taxes to the government if those new taxes eliminate larger private health care bills -- again, there are ""taxes"" by any other name -- that they now pay.

Some mainstream pundits are simply repeating what they hear from Democratic Party conservatives and centrists, the wing that has been dominant since Clinton's election in 1992. They are following the lead of Nancy Pelosi, Pete Buttigieg and others who are trashing Medicare for All.

What in the world are these leading Democratic Party politicians doing in opposing the transition to a fairer, more efficient and lower cost health care system? I would suggest it's not a lack of understanding. It's the power of campaign financing. These Democrats are funded by the status quo. The health sector contributed $265 million to federal campaigns in 2018, of which 56% went to Democrats. The sector spends nearly $500 million per year on lobbying. Money talks. Meanwhile, Americans go bankrupt or die early.

There remains the issue of the best way to raise budget revenues for Medicare for All. The basic answer is to use progressive taxation to fund the program. In this way, the nation as a whole will pay much less for health care and the vast majority of households will as well. The highest income households will end up paying a bit more because their funds will not only finance their own health care but will help to pay the health care costs of the poorest households as well.

Sanders rightly proposed a menu of options to pay for Medicare for All, including payroll and income taxation. Warren has proposed one specific approach: progressive taxes on the super-rich and the corporate sector but also a surprisingly regressive ""head tax"" on companies. She took great pride in not charging a penny of new income or payroll taxes on middle class households. But the proposed head tax on companies would hit wages indirectly and regressively.

Still, both Sanders' and Warrens' approaches would result in a more equitable and less expensive system. For most households, overall health care costs will decline.

The most worrisome thing about Warren's statement as she introduced her Medicare for All plan, is her emphasis on ""not one penny"" of new middle-class taxes. Here we go again. The Democrats have, for far too long, copied the Republican mantra about ""no new taxes,"" even as our public debt soars, our infrastructure and public services collapse and inequality reaches stratospheric dimensions.

To honor the silly stricture of ""no new taxes"" directly paid by middle-class households, Warren ended up endorsing a regressive head tax paid by the employer, which would end up hitting lower-wage workers even though its paid by their employers.

Buttigieg was speaking at a Latino candidate forum after attending a convention of the state’s Democrats, whom he has been courting aggressively ahead of California’s March 3 primary, in Long Beach.

The Golden State, which has the largest delegate haul, has traditionally voted in June, but state leaders chose to shift it earlier to give voters a bigger role in determining the winner of presidential primaries.

Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn’t violate Mexico’s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn’t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically — do you see a time when troops can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation — as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partner south of the border.

Buttigieg seems to have missed the point of the question: that American lives are, in fact, on the line.

The Sacramento Bee reports that Buttigieg was the only candidate who faced a direct question about sending troops to Mexico.

Other candidates were sharply critical of Buttigieg’s remarks. Aggressive rhetoric about Mexico is taboo in the Democratic Party, ever since President Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on building a wall along the border — and making Mexico pay for it.

(Since then, Trump has ordered the military to build new portions of “wall” — heavy bollard fencing — along the border, over congressional objections, and secured an agreement with Mexico to place thousands of troops at its southern border, at its expense.)

Buttigieg remains in single digits in most nationwide polls, occupying fourth place, the first of the second-tier candidates, well behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the front of the pack. He is leading in recent polls in Iowa, however, and is focusing his resources in early primary states.

Meanwhile, delegates to the convention were reportedly suggesting that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) drop out, given that she is polling poorly in her own home state.

Harris has focused her campaign’s dwindling resources on Iowa, rather than on nearby Nevada, the third primary state, where she has a geographical advantage.

Warren and Sanders have been battling it out in recent national and early voting state polls. The Hill-HarrisX poll, taken among 449 registered voters November 16 – 17, 2019, showed Joe Biden (D) – who has been in a back and forth with both Warren and Sanders, as recent polls indicate – leading the pack with 30 percent of the vote. Sanders overtook Warren for second place, with 18 percent to the Massachusetts senator’s 15 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in Iowa, came in fourth place with seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who garnered just four percent support. Notably, billionaire Michael Bloomberg came in right behind the California lawmaker with three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less.

Biden made waves over the weekend after expressing skepticism of legalizing marijuana at the federal level, contending that there is “not nearly” enough evidence to definitively determine if it acts as a “gateway drug.”

“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden told an audience in Las Vegas, Nevada, over the weekend. “It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

“It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally,” he continued. “I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”

The presidential hopeful’s remark sparked responses from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — who has vowed to legalize marijuana within the first 100 days in the office via executive order and create federal programs designed to help former convicts secure jobs in the marijuana industry — and his supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 18, 2019

Modine’s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats — Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion.

A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks.

The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren’s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.

The Biden campaign’s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful’s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter — a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren — and reported just $9 million cash on hand.

“His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,” as Breitbart News noted."

A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina. Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent.

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively.

Biden’s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was “safe,” while 55 percent said the former vice president was “down to earth.” A further 71 percent believed Biden’s policy stances were “about right for defeating [President] Donald Trump” in 2020.

Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as “risky” by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist.

The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points.

Biden’s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent survey from Monmouth Poll estimated that more than six-in-ten of South Carolina’s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020.

Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates’ level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president’s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux.

In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter’s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president’s political position. Biden’s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs.

As Biden’s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg’s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor’s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina.

Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor’s speeches.

Another likely late entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend “whatever it takes” to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor’s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he’s already running.

As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president’s position in South Carolina.

When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg’s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn’t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey."

The release came hours before the top Democratic candidates vying to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 take part in the fifth primary debate. The timing is not accidental: Buttigieg, after rising in polls in Iowa , is expecting to be the focus of attention onstage. The tax returns will likely be a response if the mayor is attacked for his work at the firm.

""As someone who worked in the private sector, I understand it is important to be as transparent as possible about how much money I made during that time,"" Buttigieg said. ""Every candidate in this race should be transparent with voters by disclosing their income in the private and public sectors.""

Buttigieg declared $80,397 of adjusted gross income in 2007, his first year at McKinsey. The would-be mayor filed $122,680 of adjusted gross income from his second year, in 2008. Buttigieg previously released 10 years of tax returns in April, including 2009, his last full year at McKinsey. He earned $136,129 that year.

Buttigieg's work at McKinsey has been shrouded in secrecy for the entirety of his 2020 bid. The mayor signed a nondisclosure agreement with the firm when he left, and little is known about his clients. Wednesday's release did not include his list of clients.

Buttigieg worked at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010 before jumping into politics. In 2010, he ran for Indiana treasurer, a race he would lose handily. The following year, he successfully ran for mayor of South Bend.

In his recent memoir, Buttigieg cast his time at McKinsey as a chance to get real world experience after graduating from Harvard and Oxford; the book spends the most time focused on a project to better understand grocery pricing.

""Back to the US in 2007,"" the mayor wrote, ""I landed a job in Chicago at McKinsey & Company, and my classroom was everywhere -- a conference room, a serene corporate office, the break room of a retail store, a safe house in Iraq, or an airplane seat -- any place that could accommodate me and my laptop.""

He added: ""﻿The capstone on my decade of education was in 2010, when I left McKinsey for a tough but priceless year-long political crash course in which I challenged the state treasurer of Indiana and was overwhelmingly defeated in my first experience on the ballot.""

According to a spokesman, Buttigieg has asked McKinsey to be released from the nondisclosure agreement.

""His work there is largely covered by a nondisclosure agreement,"" spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""Previously, the campaign had reached out to McKinsey to inquire about what the NDA encompasses, and this week again reached out to McKinsey about the possibility of being released from the NDA.""

Buttigieg largely leaves his time at McKinsey out of the personal story he tells voters on the campaign trail, and opposing Democratic campaigns have been privately interested in learning more about the mayor's client list.

Buttigieg told CNN earlier this year that he had gone to McKinsey because he ""felt that I needed to get experience in business."" While he had studied economics, he had not ""done the work of being involved in how people and money and goods move around the world.""

""I had an opportunity to work on those things at a place known for being very strong at it and for the kind of training that helps educate for that, and it felt like the missing piece of my education,"" he said. ""I wasn't sure consulting was going to be for me for the long term. But I knew that I could grow and do that, and I do think it's, it could be distinguishing relative to people have no business experience at a time where we got to demonstrate that you can be progressive, pro-labor and reasonably knowledgeable about business too.""

But McKinsey's record is far from spotless.

Lawsuits have raised questions about the firm's role in the opioid crisis . And some of the firm's work abroad, namely -- according to The New York Times -- in Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey, has raised questions about McKinsey's role in helping authoritarian regimes. This controversial work happened after Buttigieg left the firm.

Buttigieg, asked by CNN if he thinks McKinsey is acting ethically, said, ""I think they've made a lot of poor choices, especially in the last few years. I left about 10 years ago, but it's really frustrating as somebody who worked there to see some of the decisions that they've made."""

The debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will take place in the shadow of televised impeachment hearings in Washington. Hours before the debate's start time, officials, including the US ambassador to the European Union, publicly appeared before the House Intelligence Committee.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg enters debate night after emerging as the clear leader in the most recent CNN/Des Moines Register Iowa poll . Like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who entered the October debate with momentum, Buttigieg could face more direct attacks from his opponents during Wednesday night's event given his increased standing in the race.

Since the last debate, three candidates have suspended their campaigns: former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also launched a late-entry presidential bid, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is now considering getting into the race. These moves signal the Democratic primary race continues to be unsettled 75 days out from Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.

What time is the debate?

The debate will air live at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday from Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. It will run for two hours.

How can I watch it?

The debate will be broadcast exclusively on MSNBC and will also stream for free on MSNBC.com and washingtonpost.com, as well as on NBC News and The Washington Post's mobile apps, according to the Democratic National Committee.

How was the stage decided?

The DNC has progressively raised the qualifying thresholds for the primary Democratic debates that began in June. In order to make the November stage, candidates had to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved national or early state polls or at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Candidates also had to raise money from 165,000 separate donors, including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

McCammond says that Barkley told her he felt like hitting her after he noted that he was a supporter of former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick who recently said he is jumping onto the 2020 hunt for the Democrat nomination. Barkley’s veiled threat came after McCammond interjected to point out that Barkley also said he was a supporter of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

After she asked about Buttigieg, Barkley said he would hit her and when she objected to the threat the TNT sports commentator retorted that she “couldn’t take a joke.”

The first serious conversations about domestic abuse in sports were sparked in 1990 by Barkley's comment about beating his wife. A year later, he spat on an eight-year-old girl during a game.

And teachers attended from all ends of the state, some leaving as early as 5 a.m. to drive to Indianapolis,” the Indianapolis Star reported

Chanting “Red for Ed” and carrying signs, crowds formed around each side of the building starting early in the morning. Before 10 a.m. the crowd was shoulder to shoulder on the south lawn, waving signs as a band played and union leaders made remarks. Organized by Indiana State Teachers Association and other labor groups, speakers called on lawmakers to make changes in public education, especially when it comes to teacher pay, holding districts harmless from poor performances on a new statewide test and for new professional development requirements to be repealed.

Fox 19 reported the crowd at the #Red for Ed rally was “more than 15,000.”

More than 15,000 teachers rallied at the statehouse in an effort to push lawmakers to make changes to education. The majority of Indiana schools were closed on Tuesday for Red for Ed Action Day. The Indiana State Teachers Association calls it a historic day for education. “The children of Indiana are counting on us, and we will not let them down,” said Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill to a crowd of people dressed in red from head to toe. “It’s time to respect teachers’ time and professional knowledge.” Educators at the rally said you can’t put students first if you put teachers last. The crowd of red showed up by the thousands to get lawmakers inside the statehouse to hear them loud and clear. Educators from more than 145 districts across the state say kids notice that teachers are being overworked and underpaid.

As the Indianapolis Star reported, the Indiana State Teachers Association, which represents the public school teachers participating in the “#RedforEd Action Day” rally, has three key political objectives it wants to accomplish with the state legislature:

It wants an investment from the state in teacher pay. It wants lawmakers to make good on a promise to hold schools and teachers harmless from state test scores, which dropped sharply when the state introduced the new ILEARN test in the spring. It wants a new professional development requirement repealed.

Public schools in South Bend, Indiana, the city of just over 100,000 whose mayor, Pete Buttigieg, is now among the top tier of Democratic presidential contenders, were among those that closed on Tuesday.



Buttigieg and nine other 2020 contenders for the Democrat presidential nomination will debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night.

As Breitbart News reported in February, the #RedforEd movement, which began in Arizona in March 2018, “threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority.”

All of the leading Democrats running for president have been fully supportive of #RedforEd teachers engaging in political activism.

While leaders of the teachers union and the #RedforEd movement are focused on issues that include more pay for teachers and additional support staff, the 2019 Nation’s Report Card released last month concluded that among the country’s 4th grade and 8th grade students there has been “no progress in either mathematics or reading performance” in the past decade."

For the first time, President Trump is taking the lead ahead of four top Democrat candidates in potential head to head match-ups, according to a Wednesday poll conducted by Marquette University Law School.

According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed.

“We don’t know how this story is going to end,” said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. “At the moment just over half think there was an ask.”

It was also noted that in October — before the public testimony began — the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed.

When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the margin of error), which turns the tables from August’s survey results that showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent.

As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by 48 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent.

“Call it a small advantage to Trump,” said Franklin.

The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not.

With regards to whether or not the president’s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong.

The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina. Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent.

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively.

Biden’s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was “safe,” while 55 percent said the former vice president was “down to earth.” A further 71 percent believed Biden’s policy stances were “about right for defeating [President] Donald Trump” in 2020.

Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as “risky” by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist.

The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points.

Biden’s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent survey from Monmouth Poll estimated that more than six-in-ten of South Carolina’s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020.

Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates’ level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president’s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux.

In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter’s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president’s political position. Biden’s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs.

As Biden’s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg’s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor’s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina.

Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor’s speeches.

Another likely late entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend “whatever it takes” to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor’s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he’s already running.

As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president’s position in South Carolina.

When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg’s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn’t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey."

Elizabeth Warren's introductory ""Medicare for All"" option looks similar to the proposals championed by former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

All three would offer government-run health insurance options on the Affordable Care Act exchanges that would compete with private insurance plans. All would allow those with employer-sponsored policies to sign up for the public plan. All promise to make the coverage more affordable. And all would automatically enroll low-income Americans in coverage.

But Warren's proposal , and what it would offer Americans, is significantly different from those of her more moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

To start, it would be the first step toward adopting a government-run Medicare for All system in the US, which is Sen. Bernie Sanders' brainchild. Also, her option is far more generous and is aimed at building support for full universal coverage by quickly immersing tens of millions of Americans in Medicare for All.

""It looks like a very substantial down payment on Medicare for All,"" said Chris Jennings, a health policy expert and former official in the Clinton and Obama administrations. ""It may be more than halfway there.""

The risk for Warren is that her new plan is unlikely to blunt attacks from either Biden or Buttigieg , while inviting new skepticism from some on the left, who had previously questioned her commitment to Sanders' Medicare for All bill. Hours after the release of Warren's proposed ""transition"" this month, Sanders announced that, if elected, he would bring up the full legislation during his ""first week in office"" -- striking an indirect but unmistakable contrast with his longtime progressive ally.

Sanders' transition plan, which he first introduced in 2017, would, in its first year, place every American 55 or older, along with people up to age 18, into his version of the Medicare for All program. People would also have the option to buy in immediately. Over the next two years, according to the current bill's language, the Medicare for All enrollment age would drop to 45, then 35. By the fourth year, everyone would be covered.

Buttigieg's emergence as the front-runner in Iowa means his own proposal is about to come under increased scrutiny. Buttigieg's plan, which he describes as ""Medicare for all who want it,"" is a thinner version of what Warren is planning to do off the bat, and neither the South Bend mayor nor Biden has drawn up a clear path to universal coverage -- a priority for almost every Democrat running in the primary.

Here are some notable ways the leading primary contenders' plans differ:

How much people have to pay

Biden and Buttigieg aim to expand coverage in part by enhancing federal premium subsidies -- both for those currently eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those who now earn too much for assistance.

They would provide access to premium subsidies to everyone buying insurance on the exchanges. Under Obamacare, only those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $50,000 for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four, qualify for federal help.

Those subsidies would be used to cap premiums at a maximum of 8.5% of income, rather than roughly 10% under Obamacare. And Biden and Buttigieg would tie the premium subsidies to more generous gold plans -- which have lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs -- rather than silver policies so enrollees would spend less when they visit the doctor or a hospital.

And Buttigieg would allow those with access to employer coverage to buy policies on the Obamacare exchange and receive federal subsidies, while Biden would open up the subsidies to workers who select the public option. Currently, those with affordable policies at their jobs don't qualify for Obamacare subsides.

Also, Biden and Buttigieg would automatically enroll uninsured, low-income Americans either in the public option or in Medicaid, depending on whether their state expanded Medicaid to those making less than 138% of the poverty level, or roughly $17,250 for an individual or $35,550 for a family of four.

Buttigieg also wants to create a fund that would reimburse health care providers for caring for the uninsured. Those lacking coverage would be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Warren's option, which she is proposing to pass in the first 100 days of her administration, would have no monthly premium for children under 18 and people below 200% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $25,000 for an individual and $51,500 for a family of four.

For everyone else, premiums would be capped at 5% of income -- making her option cheaper and, in theory, more attractive as she seeks to build public support for a full transition to Medicare for All.

Plus, deductibles wouldn't exist in Warren's plan. Children and those earning less than twice the poverty level would have no out-of-pocket costs for care. Others would have to pay something, though it would be capped.

Over time, premiums and cost-sharing would gradually decrease to zero.

What benefits enrollees would receive

The public option plans envisioned by Biden and Buttigieg would provide the same broad coverage as the policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges today. Obamacare requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, including mental health, prescription drugs and maternity, at a minimum.

Warren's option would be even more comprehensive, providing the same benefits as the Medicare for All bill introduced by Sanders, who is committed to passing his legislation in one shot. It would cover vision, dental, hearing aids and some long-term care.

How much it will cost

Biden says his plan would cost roughly $750 billion over 10 years, which he would pay for by raising the top marginal tax rate and the rate on capital gains for the wealthy. Buttigieg's proposal would come in at $1.5 trillion over a decade, which he would cover by rolling back President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and through cost savings from allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

Warren hasn't specified the cost of the first step of her plan. However, her campaign said it would be ""significantly higher"" than her rivals' proposals but less than the $11 trillion Americans are expected to shell out for health care over the next decade."

Pete Buttigieg defend his level of experience on Wednesday in contentious exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, using the debate to argue “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.”

The most contentious point of Buttigieg’s defense came when the mayor said, “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country.”

Buttigieg’s experience – he leads a city of just over 100,000 people, has only ever been elected by a few voters thousand and lost his only statewide election – has been a central question about his candidacy. And it was clear on Wednesday that his competitors came into the debate looking to questions his qualifications.

When Buttigieg mentioned voting rights, Klobuchar jumped in and said the issue is a “good example of where (Buttigieg) has said the right words” but not followed it up with action and called the mayor a “local official.”

“I have actually done this work,” Klobuchar said.

Buttigieg fired back.

“Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said, nodding not only his time as mayor, but his experience as a war veteran.

“I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late,” Buttigieg said.

Then Gabbard jumped and said Buttigieg showed a lack of judgment when he suggested using the U.S. military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.

“That is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics, Buttigieg responded. “Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? … I’m talking about building alliances.”

The mayor then hit Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“Let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad,” Buttigieg said.

Gabbard responded by noting how past leaders met with opposing leaders, citing when President John F. Kennedy met with Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev and former President Franklin Roosevelt met with Russian leader Joseph Stalin.

Buttigieg interrupted, “Like Donald Trump who met with Kim,” a nod to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un."

The release came hours before the top Democratic candidates vying to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 take part in the fifth primary debate. The timing is not accidental: Buttigieg, after rising in polls in Iowa , is expecting to be the focus of attention onstage. The tax returns will likely be a response if the mayor is attacked for his work at the firm.

""As someone who worked in the private sector, I understand it is important to be as transparent as possible about how much money I made during that time,"" Buttigieg said. ""Every candidate in this race should be transparent with voters by disclosing their income in the private and public sectors.""

Buttigieg declared $80,397 of adjusted gross income in 2007, his first year at McKinsey. The would-be mayor filed $122,680 of adjusted gross income from his second year, in 2008. Buttigieg previously released 10 years of tax returns in April, including 2009, his last full year at McKinsey. He earned $136,129 that year.

Buttigieg's work at McKinsey has been shrouded in secrecy for the entirety of his 2020 bid. The mayor signed a nondisclosure agreement with the firm when he left, and little is known about his clients. Wednesday's release did not include his list of clients.

Buttigieg worked at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010 before jumping into politics. In 2010, he ran for Indiana treasurer, a race he would lose handily. The following year, he successfully ran for mayor of South Bend.

In his recent memoir, Buttigieg cast his time at McKinsey as a chance to get real world experience after graduating from Harvard and Oxford; the book spends the most time focused on a project to better understand grocery pricing.

""Back to the US in 2007,"" the mayor wrote, ""I landed a job in Chicago at McKinsey & Company, and my classroom was everywhere -- a conference room, a serene corporate office, the break room of a retail store, a safe house in Iraq, or an airplane seat -- any place that could accommodate me and my laptop.""

He added: ""﻿The capstone on my decade of education was in 2010, when I left McKinsey for a tough but priceless year-long political crash course in which I challenged the state treasurer of Indiana and was overwhelmingly defeated in my first experience on the ballot.""

According to a spokesman, Buttigieg has asked McKinsey to be released from the nondisclosure agreement.

""His work there is largely covered by a nondisclosure agreement,"" spokesman Chris Meagher said. ""Previously, the campaign had reached out to McKinsey to inquire about what the NDA encompasses, and this week again reached out to McKinsey about the possibility of being released from the NDA.""

Buttigieg largely leaves his time at McKinsey out of the personal story he tells voters on the campaign trail, and opposing Democratic campaigns have been privately interested in learning more about the mayor's client list.

Buttigieg told CNN earlier this year that he had gone to McKinsey because he ""felt that I needed to get experience in business."" While he had studied economics, he had not ""done the work of being involved in how people and money and goods move around the world.""

""I had an opportunity to work on those things at a place known for being very strong at it and for the kind of training that helps educate for that, and it felt like the missing piece of my education,"" he said. ""I wasn't sure consulting was going to be for me for the long term. But I knew that I could grow and do that, and I do think it's, it could be distinguishing relative to people have no business experience at a time where we got to demonstrate that you can be progressive, pro-labor and reasonably knowledgeable about business too.""

But McKinsey's record is far from spotless.

Lawsuits have raised questions about the firm's role in the opioid crisis . And some of the firm's work abroad, namely -- according to The New York Times -- in Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey, has raised questions about McKinsey's role in helping authoritarian regimes. This controversial work happened after Buttigieg left the firm.

Buttigieg, asked by CNN if he thinks McKinsey is acting ethically, said, ""I think they've made a lot of poor choices, especially in the last few years. I left about 10 years ago, but it's really frustrating as somebody who worked there to see some of the decisions that they've made."""

The debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will take place in the shadow of televised impeachment hearings in Washington. Hours before the debate's start time, officials, including the US ambassador to the European Union, publicly appeared before the House Intelligence Committee.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg enters debate night after emerging as the clear leader in the most recent CNN/Des Moines Register Iowa poll . Like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who entered the October debate with momentum, Buttigieg could face more direct attacks from his opponents during Wednesday night's event given his increased standing in the race.

Since the last debate, three candidates have suspended their campaigns: former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also launched a late-entry presidential bid, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is now considering getting into the race. These moves signal the Democratic primary race continues to be unsettled 75 days out from Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.

What time is the debate?

The debate will air live at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday from Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. It will run for two hours.

How can I watch it?

The debate will be broadcast exclusively on MSNBC and will also stream for free on MSNBC.com and washingtonpost.com, as well as on NBC News and The Washington Post's mobile apps, according to the Democratic National Committee. Audio of the debate will be available on SiriusXM Channel 118, and TuneIn.

How was the stage decided?

The DNC has progressively raised the qualifying thresholds for the primary Democratic debates that began in June. In order to make the November stage, candidates had to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved national or early state polls or at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Candidates also had to raise money from 165,000 separate donors, including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

(CNN) In my career, I've never been accused of grade inflation but I found Wednesday evening's debate to be the best overall this season -- so my grade book runneth over. My two As really were a tie at the top.

A

Pete Buttigieg

Mayor Pete demonstrated some sweet debating techniques that I teach, yet rarely see deployed as well as he did last night. He pivoted questions to keep his answers on topic, but still unique from the other candidates -- and by doing so he provided himself with an advantage.

Buttigieg struck on one key point that, as he noted, has been largely swept under the rug: ""The President had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans."" Many Democrats will agree that the country needed to hear somebody on a national stage emphasize that important point.

But Buttigieg was not a one-trick pony. Far from it. Let's examine his defense. He smoothly reframed the attacks that were leveled at him so that they played to his advantage. For instance, he was asked why he's a candidate worth backing, given that he lost his only statewide election. He replied that, while he may not have ""traditional establishment Washington experience,"" that's not necessarily what the country needs. And when Senator Amy Klobuchar raised the point again, he shot back, saying, ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Buttigieg made it clear that he isn't going to roll over for anybody, especially Donald Trump. Voters needed to see well-harnessed assertiveness, and Buttigieg's tone and demeanor were just right this time.

A

Andrew Yang

I don't grade on a lack of speaking time, since it's not the candidate's fault. I coach my teams to make fewer arguments than our competitors, but to make sure the positions we take are thorough and well-grounded.

That said, I dare you to find a bad answer from Andrew Yang in last night's debate. Hint: You won't. He scored an A from me every single time he spoke. I've never witnessed that before.

While it was well into the debate before Yang spoke, his answers about some of the threats to American society once again, brought new ideas to the debate stage. Artificial intelligence, which he's mentioned in previous debates, is a future threat that must be taken seriously. And setting up something like a WTO (World Trade Organization) for data? His ingenuity was astounding. Bold ideas suit Yang well -- and, when well thought out and pragmatic, they get high points in a debate.

A-

Kamala Harris

She's a master at criticizing others without coming across as a jerk. She called out Tulsi Gabbard for spending ""four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama"" before going on to admonish her efforts to be chummy with Trump and Steve Bannon, and her criticism of the Democratic party. It was a horrible look for Gabbard.

On policy, Harris also shone. She displayed great knowledge of foreign policy, North Korea, race and women's issues, and rebuilding Democratic coalitions.

A-

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has found his groove in the last two debates. But he wasn't perfect. For example, he should have given a more direct answer to the question about whether chants of ""locking him up"" (referring to Donald Trump) should be discouraged.

He did have strong moments, however. In a clever pivot, when asked to defend how Medicare for All is a ""revolution,"" Sanders pointed to the ""cruel"" and ""dysfunctional"" health care system before backing his answer up with statistics on how many Americans go bankrupt over medical bills.

Sanders was also excellent on answers about the need to work now to fix climate change and his willingness to deal with controversial adversaries from the Taliban to Saudi Arabia and Iran.

B+

Elizabeth Warren

I'm a sucker for folding breaking news into a debate, and Warren put selling ambassadorships front and center after Gordon Sondland's impeachment testimony yesterday. Well done indeed.

Even better was when she articulated her three-year plan for Medicare for All, and it answered many questions that have been posed in the past. She needs to continue adding this to her answer. She also had a sharp explanation about the fact that we subsidize white, but not black wealth through housing. I lowered her score a bit due to her response that the number of people who serve in the military should be higher; while she gave a heartfelt answer about the benefit of service to the country, she didn't clarify whether she believes the military could use a larger number of troops.

B

Cory Booker

Logical flaws are not an issue with the senator. Booker had an interesting answer on abortion by linking it to voter suppression. He also spoke intelligently about homeownership and gentrification.

But in some areas, he came up short. His best criticism of Biden was off-topic. Booker was asked an important question about Trump's border wall, but he gave a two-line response before turning to a discussion of race and marijuana, and using it as an opportunity to attack Biden.

If candidates chose to ignore the question and pivot to that they think are their best positions instead, what are the moderators for?

B-

Joe Biden

I teach my debaters the importance of every single word. You can lose a debate by simply saying the wrong word at the wrong time. Enter Joe Biden.

Yes, he made a couple of big gaffes. You don't use the word ""punching"" when emphasizing a talking point about domestic violence. And it matters. You don't refer to the ""only African-American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate."" (Another one was standing on stage with you, Joe.) His defense was that he thought he said ""first,"" but he didn't. He said ""only."" And it matters. These small mistakes might have not been a huge setback for any other candidate, but they are magnified because of Biden's history of slip-ups.

I'm predicting pundits will focus on those two incidents and lose track of the bigger picture, which is that Biden was having his best debate yet. His ""only"" mistake overshadowed a great response to Booker's attack about legalizing marijuana. Decriminalize it, and let out those who are jailed because of it.

Apart from the mess-ups, Biden was on a roll. Plus, his critique of Tom Steyer for having invested in the coal industry hit home.

B-

Amy Klobuchar

If there's one thing we know about Amy Klobuchar, it's that she loves a good canned line. Actually, I enjoyed one too — her quip about receiving $17k for her campaign from her ex-boyfriends was kind of funny, for a change.

Klobuchar had many thoughtful answers on everything from voter suppression to women being held to a higher standard, to abortion. Her biggest error was criticizing Buttigieg's lack of experience, and she ended up getting the worst of the exchange when Buttigieg responded with a sharp answer.

C-

Tom Steyer

He still needs a public speaking coach. His eye contact with the moderators was better at first, but by the end of the debate, they were again fixated on the camera.

It didn't help his grade that Biden accused him of ties to the coal industry prior to his turn to politics, while others were fighting for the environment.

Guilt is a weird motivator. And Steyer had no good answer to this criticism.

On a positive note, he had a good answer about addressing homelessness.

D-

Tulsi Gabbard

She was called out by both Harris and Buttigieg -- effectively.

Gabbard had a good answer on the reform needed in the criminal justice system, but then mistakenly pivoted from it to preaching about treating people with respect. She should have stayed on topic.

She could have given a thoughtful answer about climate change but she instead said it was not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is coming from a candidate who has appeared on conservative television and radio, where climate change is used as a wedge issue between the scientific community and the public. Voters (and debate coaches) will at best see this as an insincere attempt to preach unity and at worst see it as deeply hypocritical."

In Wednesday night's debate , the party's leading contenders offered their clearest arguments yet about how they plan to do that.

Subtly jabbing their rivals, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris said that Democrats can't win without rebuilding former President Barack Obama's diverse coalition of supporters.

""The question black women voters have for us as candidates is: Where you been, and what are you gonna do?"" Harris said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden also staked a claim to the Obama coalition, but stumbled into an awkward moment while doing so.

Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders used his closing statement to try to reach Latinos, a crucial part of the electorate in Nevada -- the third state to vote in the Democratic nominating process and key for Biden -- as well as California and Texas, which will award huge swaths of delegates on Super Tuesday.

""I am the son of an immigrant,"" he said. ""I have some sense of an immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.""

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar made her most forceful case yet that her history of winning in red and purple portions of the Midwest -- despite the reality that in politics, ""women have to work harder"" -- give her a strong claim to the centrist lane in the 2020 primary field.

And South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who has rocketed to the top of Iowa polls in recent weeks, fended off Klobuchar's characterization of him as merely a ""local official"" and questions about his virtually nonexistent support from African Americans.

Here are eight takeaways from the fifth Democratic presidential debate:

Buttigieg on defense

Buttigieg's rise to the top of the Iowa polls meant he entered Wednesday night with the biggest target on his back.

Those attacks primarily came later in the debate. Buttigieg largely emerged from the night unscathed -- a relief for his campaign, which knew his opponents were more eager than ever to knock him down.

The first contender to take direct aim at Buttigieg was Klobuchar, who questioned his experience and chided the small-city mayor as a ""local official.""

Buttigieg responded by quickly pivoting to an attack on Washington.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" he said. ""There is more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country?""

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also took a swing, saying Buttigieg lacked judgment when he suggested using the US military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.

Buttigieg called her claim ""outlandish, even by the standards of today's politics"" and criticized her for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

And Harris implicitly knocked Buttigieg for his struggles with courting black voters. Buttigieg accepted her criticism -- ""I completely agree,"" he said to the California senator -- and then acknowledged that the lack of African American support is a problem but said he will ""welcome the challenge.""

Then, there were more subtle jabs -- like when Booker noted that he is the ""other Rhodes Scholar"" in the race. But for all but the most engaged viewers, those moments might not have registered.

Klobuchar's electability argument

Klobuchar had a clear goal Wednesday night: Plant serious doubt in Democratic voters' minds that Biden is the most electable candidate and that Buttigieg is the voice of the Midwest.

She hit those marks more effectively than ever before.

Contrasting herself with Buttigieg, Klobuchar said that ""women have to work harder, and that's a fact."" Then, she transitioned into the hard work she's done: Winning even the red and purple congressional districts in her battleground state, and then playing a role in the passage of a long list of legislation in the Senate.

She also took a broad shot at progressive policy goals like ""Medicare for All"" and free college tuition.

""I'm not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" she said.

It's far from clear that Klobuchar changed her trajectory in any major way. Her campaign is built entirely on the prospect of a strong finish in Iowa, where polls show her moving into the mid-single digits but still far from the 15% threshold she'll need to hit at individual caucus sites to actually pick up delegates. And the core of her argument -- that many bold ideas with broad support among progressives are unserious -- might not motivate many voters.

But the Minnesota senator's play is for the center lane. And on Wednesday, she mounted her clearest case yet that her record and electoral history in Minnesota are assets Biden and Buttigieg don't have.

Biden's stumbles

Biden walked himself into several awkward moments in the latter portion of Wednesday night's debate.

One came when he was asked about domestic violence. Biden had pointed out that he'd written the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, but then said of continuing to combat the problem: ""We have to keep punching at it, and punching at it, and punching at it.""

Another came when Biden -- attempting to reference former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, who is a strong backer of his campaign -- claimed to have been endorsed by ""the only African American woman who's ever been elected to the United States Senate.""

Booker quickly said, ""That's not true."" And Harris, the second black woman elected to the Senate, said, ""I'm standing right here"" -- and then laughed.

Correcting himself, Biden said, ""I said the first.""

The former vice president also had strong moments. Much of the debate's second half focused on foreign policy, and at one point, in a moment that would mark a significant break from US policy, Biden pledged to end weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and treat the country like ""the pariah that they are.""

Booker hits Biden on marijuana legalization

The exchange over black voters started when Booker chastised Biden over marijuana. The former vice president had said days earlier that he is opposed to legalizing marijuana on the federal level, saying he wants more research into whether it's a ""gateway drug.""

""I thought you might have been high when you said it,"" Booker said.

The New Jersey senator has long advocated for the federal government to legalize marijuana. So have all the other leading Democratic contenders -- except Biden.

To be clear, Biden's position on marijuana legalization is well to the left of existing federal policy. He argued that marijuana should be decriminalized, with all marijuana arrests expunged from the records of those convicted. He has also said marijuana should be removed from the list of Schedule I drugs so that researchers can study its effects.

But Booker was arguing that legalizing marijuana is a matter of racial justice, and that Democrats won't be able to rebuild the coalition of voters assembled by Barack Obama if black voters are alienated. He specifically pointed to a drop in black turnout in Wisconsin in the 2016 election.

Biden, touting his endorsements from black congressional leaders and his strong poll numbers with African-American voters nationwide and especially in South Carolina, said, ""I'm talking to that Obama coalition. I come out of the black community, in terms of my support.""

Bernie Sanders keeps climate change in the conversation

The question was about Democrats who chant ""Lock him up!"" at the mention of President Trump, and whether he approved, but Sanders had something else on his mind: climate change.

""When you talk about the climate crisis,"" Sanders said, though no one was, ""the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real, they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.""

Later on, when the moderators did ask about climate change, Sanders took exception with their framing.

""Your questioner said, 'What are we going to do in decades?' We don't have decades,"" Sanders said. ""What the scientists are telling us is, if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities, going under water.""

He went on to tick off the potential catastrophes that lie ahead, in particular the potential for a climate refugee crisis that sets off a national security emergency. Sanders also took a page from his Green New Deal plan, suggesting that fossil fuel companies should face legal scrutiny for misleading the public.

""They have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe,"" Sanders said, ""we should think about prosecuting them as well.""

Obama legacy looms large

Former President Barack Obama left office three years ago, but on Wednesday night, his legacy hovered over the Democrats vying for the job he once held.

Buttigieg turned a question about unity toward the former president. Harris defended Obama as a way to attack Gabbard. And a host of candidates -- led by Biden -- touted their ability to rebuild the coalition of voters that elected Obama.

The focus on Obama came days after the former president made his most political comments in months. The former president, in comments to donors last week, urged 2020 Democrats to by ""rooted in reality"" to avoid turning off key swaths of the electorate and not to be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

With Obama in the news, the candidates responded.

""As President Obama commented recently, we are not in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago,"" Buttigieg said.

""I think it's unfortunate that we have someone on this stage that is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for the president of the United States who during the Obama administration has spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,"" Harris said to Gabbard.

The politics around Obama and the current debate remain complicated. He is -- by far -- the most popular Democrat in the country, making it difficult to criticize him, even though some candidates have outlined policy differences on issues like deportations.

On Wednesday night, though, it was all praise.

""We're aiming to do in this cycle is build off that progress,"" said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who was Obama's labor secretary. ""Not reflect on some nostalgia, but reflect on the remarkable lessons of how we can indeed get things done.""

Impeachment dominates the day

For the first time, a Democratic presidential debate wasn't the biggest political story on the day it took place.

The explosive testimony in the House's impeachment inquiry dominated headlines and cable news all day Wednesday, and -- even though there is no real disagreement among the Democratic candidates that Trump should be impeached -- it was the first topic moderators raised.

Sanders urged Democrats to focus on policy matters, rather than just Trump's impeachment.

""He is likely the most corrupt President in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump. Because if we are, we are going to lose the election,"" Sanders said.

Warren, meanwhile, used the topic to highlight her pledge to break Washington's long-standing pattern of top campaign donors receiving ambassadorships -- such as Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union who gave $1 million to his inauguration fund.

""We are not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder,"" Warren said.

Exhaustion on health care

The first four Democratic debates featured lengthy clashes between the progressive and moderate candidates over health care: whether to push for Medicare for All or instead attempt go the less costly route of expanding Obamacare with a public option.

Nobody wanted a fifth round.

The candidates didn't press to go there. The audience -- at least those chattering about it on social media -- had no appetite for it. And the moderators only hit health care in a perfunctory way.

Each of the four leading candidates quickly hit their marks. Buttigieg touted his ""Medicare for all who want it"" plan. Biden questioned the cost of Medicare for All. Warren touted her new plan. Sanders recycled his laugh line, thanking the moderators for going to him and saying, ""I wrote the damn bill.""

And then everyone seemed happy to move on."

PBS NewsHour is partnering with Politico to produce the debate on December 19 from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. At least six Democrats have qualified to participate: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Candidates have until December 12 to meet the qualifying criteria established by the Democratic National Committee and its partners to receive an invitation to the debate.

The debate comes during tumultuous times in US history, shaped by ongoing presidential impeachment proceedings in Washington, and a country deeply divided along ideological lines.

The House impeachment proceedings are expected to continue through December, and if the House impeaches President Donald Trump, the Senate will likely take it up in January. Six of the Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination currently serve as US senators and will need to be in Washington if the Senate convenes a trial. This will make the December debate even more critical as it could be the last time these candidates will have a national stage until the next debate in January.

1. Impeachment investigation

It seems like the words ""dramatic"" and ""bombshell"" are thrown around a lot in reference to the impeachment inquiry hearings, but if there were ever a time to use them, it would be to describe yesterday's testimony from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland . Right out of the gate, Sondland confirmed that, yes, a ""quid pro quo"" scheme existed and President Trump directed it. He also said ""everyone was in the loop"" about what was going on with Ukraine foreign policy, implicating top officials including Vice President Mike Pence. Sondland's testimony punched several gaping holes in the Trump administration's defense of the Ukraine saga. For one, Sondland said he got the impression Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn't actually have to conduct the investigations; he just had to announce them. If he's correct, that lends credence to the theory that the probes were simply a political maneuver. Sondland's testimony was especially important for Democrats because he is one of the main witnesses to have had direct contact with the President during the time of the Ukraine dealings.

3. Israel

Israel may be heading for its third presidential election in 12 months. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried and failed to form a government after September's election, his opponent, former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, got the opportunity to take power and form one himself. But Gantz announced yesterday that his Blue and White party hasn't been able to gather the necessary coalition in four solid weeks of negotiations . Now, Israel is in unprecedented political territory. For the next 21 days, any member of the Israeli legislature, known as the Knesset, could potentially become Prime Minister, if they gather a political majority. If that fails, it would be back to the polls for an election-weary public.

4. United Auto Workers

There is serious trouble brewing with the United Auto Workers, one of the most powerful unions in the country. UAW's executive board took steps to remove its president , Gary Jones, and expel him from the union following allegations of bribery and misuse of union funds. So far, 10 people have pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges surrounding the scandal. Some of those charges involve bribes paid to union officials by executives at Fiat Chrysler. And now, fellow automaker GM is suing Fiat Chrysler , saying the latter engaged in corrupt bargaining with UAW. Fiat Chrysler called the charges in the suit ""meritless"" and will fight them in court. If you'll recall, the UAW recently waged a six-week strike at GM that cost the automaker an estimated $2.9 billion.

Breitbart News Senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak ventured into the crowd to speak to Buttigieg fans — as well as supporters of businessman Andrew Yang and former Vice President Joe Biden, the other two campaigns represented outside the Tyler Perry Studios.

“It’s unusual to have a mayor run for president, and you mentioned his experience — what do you think is his biggest achievement in South Bend?” Pollak asked.

“You got me on that one!” the Buttigieg supporter laughed, holding his “Pete” sign up to block the camera, in jest.

“Let me think about that one, okay?” he said.

Other Buttigieg supporters named his military service and his intelligence as reasons to support him. But none could name anything he had actually achieved in public service.

Asked what his biggest achievement was in South Bend — or even “somewhere else” –one woman answered: “I don’t know about that particularly. I know the thing in his resume, let’s say, that’s most impressive to me is that he is a military vet.”

Another woman, who had previously cited Buttigieg’s “experience,” struggled to answer the same question.

“Yes, that’s his first experience, although he’s been mayor, I think, for eight years. He’s had challenges — sometimes when you have a smaller operation, it’s tougher, even, than running a big city. You have fewer resources. He’s had hits and misses, but he’s learned from that and he’s trying to do better.”

The full video of Breitbart’s foray into the crowd is available at Breitbart News’ Facebook page, here.

Buttigieg is leading in the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, though he still trails the frontrunners nationwide."

“We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off a trade war that should not have started in the first place,” Pete Buttigieg said during the fifth Democrat debate.

The South Bend mayor commented in response to a question from MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow, who asked him if he would keep President Trump’s subsidies in place if elected president.

“I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers,” Buttigieg claimed. “He keeps asking them to take one for the team … they’re not going to benefit from business as usual from the president.”

A November survey from Iowa State University showed that farmers largely view the trade disruption from Trump’s fight with China as short-term pain for long-term gain.

Buttigieg went on to discuss how to help farmers combat climate change by building “climate-neutral farms” before he was interrupted.

Maddow pressed Buttigieg to say whether or not he would still support Trump’s subsidies for farms.

“Yes,” he replied. “But we won’t need them because we’re going to fix the trade war.”"

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in fourth place with nine percent support. Due to the relatively small sampling, the margin of error is +/- 6.1 percent, although Buttigieg’s lead is outside of statistical uncertainty.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) came in behind Sanders with six percent support, followed by billionaire Tom Steyer (D) with five percent support, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

He added, “Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess, in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans.

11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a “moral moment” right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, “good trouble.” He asks Americans to keep him on the stage.

Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the “criminal in the White House.” He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that “Mr. Trump” is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument.

Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect– “Aloha” values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the “Aloha spirit” when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says “let’s make Dr. King’s dream a reality.”

Yang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for.

He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now.

Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can’t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery.

Harris says we’re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests… she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America’s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices.

Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class.

He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building.

Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history.

Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan.

Biden says he hopes Warren wasn’t talking about the “spotless” Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the “woe is me” attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: “Get up and take it back.”

11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization’s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a “sweeping victory.”

10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg’s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his “inexperience” and cites his recent “careless statement” about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a “murderous dictator like that” (Assad).

Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes.

Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev.

10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over “Washington experience” after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us.

10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a “human right” and an “economic right” when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party.

Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don’t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies.

10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should “codify Roe v. Wade into law.” She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election.

10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if “he was high” when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850.

Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren’t those candidates.

Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. “Everyone gets out, records expunged,” Biden says. Biden says he “comes out of the black community” in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials.

Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: “Nope… The other one’s here.”

Biden misspeaks and says he had support from ""the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate,"" before correcting that he meant ""first."" Harris's reaction:pic.twitter.com/oIL1hcMfWS — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses.

10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an “economic justice” issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will “close the black-white” income gap.

10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country.

10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts.

Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them.

10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says “we have to fundamentally change the culture” re: how women are treated. He talks about the “it’s on us” movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women’s issues by keep “punching at it.”

10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way.

10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we “set the record straight” and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system.

10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks.

10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems.

He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians.

He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but “it is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.” He says America must treat Palestinians with “respect.”

10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah.

Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China.

10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump’s “transactional” foreign policy. He says Trump’s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy.

10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House.

Yang says he will say he is sorry that “I beat your guy.” He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America’s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO.

He says he will propose a new world data organization–like the WTO for data.

Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses.

10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban.

Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the “terrible war in Iraq” while he voted against it.

Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so.

10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years.

Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they “view that as a threat, it’s an easy thing to respond to” by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he’s re: Korea.

10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions.

Harris uses the question to say: “Donald Trump got punked.”

She says Trump “has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego.”

She says Trump is the greatest threat to national security and says she won’t make concessions because there are none to make right now.

10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC’s playbook, says we don’t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says “climate refugees” will cause national security problems all over the world.

He says the fossil fuel industry is “criminally liable” for lying about climate change and “maybe we should prosecute them as well.”

10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won’t say it. Warren won’t say it. He says he will declare a “state of emergency” and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy.

Biden says climate change is “the existential threat to humanity.” He says he doesn’t need a “lecture from my friend” on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than “all of Great Britain produces” while he was passing climate legislation.

Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate.

10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats.

10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump’s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump’s “trade war” that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans.

9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction).

9:53 PM: Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed.

9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight.

Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C’mon.

Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate.

9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like “poker chips” in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible.

Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today.

Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris’s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates.

9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids.

9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say “lock him up” because “it’s about civility” and we need to restore the soul of the country.

Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings.

Biden says Trump has “indicted himself.” Biden says there are two questions–whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general.

9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting “lock him up” at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders’ rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that.

Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted.

9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed.

9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world’s leaders. Sounds very establishment.

9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president.

Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It’s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don’t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with?

9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he “comes from the kind of communities” that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses.

9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: “Thank you, Andrew.”

Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang’s whole campaign theme is that today’s politician don’t understand threat of the future like AI, etc.

9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says

9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network:

Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)? This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip up. Unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/2vJrYx5DKQ — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) November 17, 2019

9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals?

9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the “rot” she she’s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the “foreign policy establishment” in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war.

Harris is asked to respond and she says “it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage” who wants to be the party’s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and “buddying up to Steve Bannon.” Harris is months late on this comeback–and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short.

9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don’t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn’t and then talks about a health care system that is “cruel and dysfunctional.” He says “some of the people up here” think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He’s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn’t mention them by name.

Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch.

9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to “feel it” and “taste it” after the third year, people are going to want it.

Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: “Thank you, I wrote the damn bill.”

9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can “galvanize” and not “polarize.” He pitches his “Medicare for all who want it” plan and says Democrats should not be “commanding” people to get Medicare.

9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her “two cents” wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren’s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth.

Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard.

It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the “moderate” candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage.

Warren says she is “tired of freeloading billionaires” and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish.

9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says “we have a criminal in the White House.” Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail.

9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated.

“Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee,” Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn’t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell’s question. Mitchell doesn’t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity.

9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump’s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a “tender” moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed.

9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a “pathological liar” who is the “most corrupt president” in modern history when asked how central Trump’s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can “walk and chew bubble gum at the same time” by dealing with Trump’s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the “rigged economy.”

9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won’t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery.

9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course.

Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale.

9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including “national security, race, and climate.”

8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an “anti-Trump” party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms.

8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate:

Governor @DevalPatrick was supposed to have an event at Morehouse College tonight. An organizer with the college who planned the event told CNN that Patrick cancelled the event when he arrived and learned that he would not have an audience.

8:39 PM: Can Mayor Pete take the heat tonight? Will his poll numbers hold after tonight’s debate?

Nina Turner of the Sander campaign, speaking for herself, ripped Buttigieg last night. And he’s going to face a lot more of that as Iowa gets nearer. Candidates like Harris and Warren who had polling surges going into the debates lost their momentum after the debates.

Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, went off on Pete Buttigieg at a fundraiser in Atlanta last night. “I don’t think you are in any position to be president,” she said, shredding the South Bend mayor’s response to a police shooting of a Black man in his city. pic.twitter.com/pwSSiXRvMl — Hayley Miller (@hayleymiller01) November 20, 2019

A message from Stacey Abrams, who is on stage firing up the crowd before the debate begins. She may fit today’s “woke” Democrats who want to leave no identity group behind as well as Ed Orgeron just fits LSU. She may regret years down the line that she didn’t get into a race that was hers for the taking. Opportunities like this do not present themselves often. Obama seized his chance.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) claimed that Stacey Abrams would have won the gubernatorial election in Georgia if not for “voting purges.”

Last year, Abrams lost her bid for Georgia governor to Gov. Brian Kemp (R). During Wednesday night’s debate, Klobuchar claimed this was due to statewide voter suppression:

I have led the way on voting and I can tell you right now one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be to allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this and we do something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges … Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now. [Emphasis added]

Klobuchar’s claim, though, is untrue and has been previously debunked by the Washington Post when Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) made a similar claim.

“Abrams fell short by 55,000 votes out of nearly 4 million cast, in a case filled with election mischief and fierce disputes,” the Post fact check states. “Buttigieg should not be so definitive in his assertion that Abrams would have won if not for racially motivated measures.”

Similarly, a report by the United States Election Assistance Commission debunked claims that Georgia voters are experiencing unprecedented voter suppression in state elections. The report revealed that Georgia ranks as number one for automated voter registration and has higher absentee ballot acceptance rates compared to past elections.

Georgia was the number one state for automated voter registration and showed significantly higher percentages of accepted absentee and provisional ballots compared to previous elections. Between 2016 and 2018, more than 3.5 million voters in Georgia registered to vote or updated their voter information — the most voters in any state in the nation.

A Brennan Center for Justice study also found that Georgia had a nearly 94 percent increase in voter registrations due to automated voter registration, also more than any state in the nation.

Axios.com contributor Alexi McCammond was in Atlanta to cover the coming Democrat presidential debate and ran across Barkley who has attended several of the Democrat debates this year.

McCammond says that Barkley told her he felt like hitting her after he noted that he was a supporter of former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick who recently said he is jumping onto the 2020 hunt for the Democrat nomination. Barkley’s veiled threat came after McCammond interjected to point out that Barkley also said he was a supporter of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

After she asked about Buttigieg, Barkley said he would hit her and when she objected to the threat the TNT sports commentator retorted that she “couldn’t take a joke.”

“Just FYI Charles Barkley told me tonight ‘I don’t hit women but if I did, I would hit you,’ and then when I objected to that he told me I ‘couldn’t take a joke,'” McCammond tweeted on Wednesday.

In a follow up tweet, McCammond added that she felt compelled to report the threat.

“There are almost no times I will beak an OTR ‘agreement’ but this is not OK,” she wrote. “And it was all because he came in talking about how he loves Deval Patrick and once someone from Pete‘s campaign came around he said he loved Pete and I reminded him he previously said he was a Deval fan.”

McCammond also tweeted a grainy photo of Barkley surrounded by reporters to prove she was there.

The reporter went on to exclaim that she does not want to make herself “part of the story” and that she is not crying about her feelings being hurt.

It’s not about me or my feelings — tho I’m grateful for the many friends who have reached out. But it’s about refusing to allow this culture to perpetuate because of silence on these issues.

Other reporters noted that Barkley has a history of joking about beating women. Sports reporter Timothy Burke reminded his readers that Barkley got in trouble for joking about beating his wife in the 1990s.

The first serious conversations about domestic abuse in sports were sparked in 1990 by Barkley's comment about beating his wife. A year later, he spat on an eight-year-old girl during a game. A year after that, Nike featured him in the famous ""not a role model"" ad. https://t.co/xJSbFNKZie pic.twitter.com/Ahfq6JxL3T — Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) November 20, 2019

“More than half of the school districts in the state closed their doors Tuesday for Red for Ed, with some converting the day into either an e-learning day or an employee workday. And teachers attended from all ends of the state, some leaving as early as 5 a.m. to drive to Indianapolis,” the Indianapolis Star reported

Chanting “Red for Ed” and carrying signs, crowds formed around each side of the building starting early in the morning. Before 10 a.m. the crowd was shoulder to shoulder on the south lawn, waving signs as a band played and union leaders made remarks. Organized by Indiana State Teachers Association and other labor groups, speakers called on lawmakers to make changes in public education, especially when it comes to teacher pay, holding districts harmless from poor performances on a new statewide test and for new professional development requirements to be repealed.

Fox 19 reported the crowd at the #Red for Ed rally was “more than 15,000.”

More than 15,000 teachers rallied at the statehouse in an effort to push lawmakers to make changes to education. The majority of Indiana schools were closed on Tuesday for Red for Ed Action Day. The Indiana State Teachers Association calls it a historic day for education. “The children of Indiana are counting on us, and we will not let them down,” said Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill to a crowd of people dressed in red from head to toe. “It’s time to respect teachers’ time and professional knowledge.” Educators at the rally said you can’t put students first if you put teachers last. The crowd of red showed up by the thousands to get lawmakers inside the statehouse to hear them loud and clear. Educators from more than 145 districts across the state say kids notice that teachers are being overworked and underpaid.

As the Indianapolis Star reported, the Indiana State Teachers Association, which represents the public school teachers participating in the “#RedforEd Action Day” rally, has three key political objectives it wants to accomplish with the state legislature:

It wants an investment from the state in teacher pay. It wants lawmakers to make good on a promise to hold schools and teachers harmless from state test scores, which dropped sharply when the state introduced the new ILEARN test in the spring. It wants a new professional development requirement repealed.

Public schools in South Bend, Indiana, the city of just over 100,000 whose mayor, Pete Buttigieg, is now among the top tier of Democratic presidential contenders, were among those that closed on Tuesday.



Buttigieg and nine other 2020 contenders for the Democrat presidential nomination will debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night.

As Breitbart News reported in February, the #RedforEd movement, which began in Arizona in March 2018, “threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority.”

All of the leading Democrats running for president have been fully supportive of #RedforEd teachers engaging in political activism.

While leaders of the teachers union and the #RedforEd movement are focused on issues that include more pay for teachers and additional support staff, the 2019 Nation’s Report Card released last month concluded that among the country’s 4th grade and 8th grade students there has been “no progress in either mathematics or reading performance” in the past decade."

For the first time, President Trump is taking the lead ahead of four top Democrat candidates in potential head to head match-ups, according to a Wednesday poll conducted by Marquette University Law School.

According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed.

“We don’t know how this story is going to end,” said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. “At the moment just over half think there was an ask.”

It was also noted that in October — before the public testimony began — the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed.

When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the margin of error), which turns the tables from August’s survey results that showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent.

As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by 48 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent.

“Call it a small advantage to Trump,” said Franklin.

The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not.

With regards to whether or not the president’s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong.

The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

Elizabeth Warren's introductory ""Medicare for All"" option looks similar to the proposals championed by former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.",2019-11-21,CNN,"Health care: How plans from Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren stack up",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/democrats-health-care-plans-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-bernie-sanders/index.html,"(CNN) At first glance, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's introductory ""Medicare for All"" option looks similar to the proposals championed by former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

All three would offer government-run health insurance options on the Affordable Care Act exchanges that would compete with private insurance plans. All would allow those with employer-sponsored policies to sign up for the public plan. All promise to make the coverage more affordable. And all would automatically enroll low-income Americans in coverage.

But Warren's proposal , and what it would offer Americans, is significantly different from those of her more moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

To start, it would be the first step toward adopting a government-run Medicare for All system in the US, which is Sen. Bernie Sanders' brainchild. Also, her option is far more generous and is aimed at building support for full universal coverage by quickly immersing tens of millions of Americans in Medicare for All.

""It looks like a very substantial down payment on Medicare for All,"" said Chris Jennings, a health policy expert and former official in the Clinton and Obama administrations. ""It may be more than halfway there.""

The risk for Warren is that her new plan is unlikely to blunt attacks from either Biden or Buttigieg , while inviting new skepticism from some on the left, who had previously questioned her commitment to Sanders' Medicare for All bill. Hours after the release of Warren's proposed ""transition"" this month, Sanders announced that, if elected, he would bring up the full legislation during his ""first week in office"" -- striking an indirect but unmistakable contrast with his longtime progressive ally.

Sanders' transition plan, which he first introduced in 2017, would, in its first year, place every American 55 or older, along with people up to age 18, into his version of the Medicare for All program. People would also have the option to buy in immediately. Over the next two years, according to the current bill's language, the Medicare for All enrollment age would drop to 45, then 35. By the fourth year, everyone would be covered.

Buttigieg's emergence as the front-runner in Iowa means his own proposal is about to come under increased scrutiny. Buttigieg's plan, which he describes as ""Medicare for all who want it,"" is a thinner version of what Warren is planning to do off the bat, and neither the South Bend mayor nor Biden has drawn up a clear path to universal coverage -- a priority for almost every Democrat running in the primary.

Here are some notable ways the leading primary contenders' plans differ:

How much people have to pay

Biden and Buttigieg aim to expand coverage in part by enhancing federal premium subsidies -- both for those currently eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those who now earn too much for assistance.

They would provide access to premium subsidies to everyone buying insurance on the exchanges. Under Obamacare, only those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $50,000 for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four, qualify for federal help.

Those subsidies would be used to cap premiums at a maximum of 8.5% of income, rather than roughly 10% under Obamacare. And Biden and Buttigieg would tie the premium subsidies to more generous gold plans -- which have lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs -- rather than silver policies so enrollees would spend less when they visit the doctor or a hospital.

And Buttigieg would allow those with access to employer coverage to buy policies on the Obamacare exchange and receive federal subsidies, while Biden would open up the subsidies to workers who select the public option. Currently, those with affordable policies at their jobs don't qualify for Obamacare subsides.

Also, Biden and Buttigieg would automatically enroll uninsured, low-income Americans either in the public option or in Medicaid, depending on whether their state expanded Medicaid to those making less than 138% of the poverty level, or roughly $17,250 for an individual or $35,550 for a family of four.

Buttigieg also wants to create a fund that would reimburse health care providers for caring for the uninsured. Those lacking coverage would be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Warren's option, which she is proposing to pass in the first 100 days of her administration, would have no monthly premium for children under 18 and people below 200% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $25,000 for an individual and $51,500 for a family of four.

For everyone else, premiums would be capped at 5% of income -- making her option cheaper and, in theory, more attractive as she seeks to build public support for a full transition to Medicare for All.

Plus, deductibles wouldn't exist in Warren's plan. Children and those earning less than twice the poverty level would have no out-of-pocket costs for care. Others would have to pay something, though it would be capped.

Over time, premiums and cost-sharing would gradually decrease to zero.

What benefits enrollees would receive

The public option plans envisioned by Biden and Buttigieg would provide the same broad coverage as the policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges today. Obamacare requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, including mental health, prescription drugs and maternity, at a minimum.

Warren's option would be even more comprehensive, providing the same benefits as the Medicare for All bill introduced by Sanders, who is committed to passing his legislation in one shot. It would cover vision, dental, hearing aids and some long-term care.

How much it will cost

Biden says his plan would cost roughly $750 billion over 10 years, which he would pay for by raising the top marginal tax rate and the rate on capital gains for the wealthy. Buttigieg's proposal would come in at $1.5 trillion over a decade, which he would cover by rolling back President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and through cost savings from allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

Warren hasn't specified the cost of the first step of her plan. However, her campaign said it would be ""significantly higher"" than her rivals' proposals but less than the $11 trillion Americans are expected to shell out for health care over the next decade."

The comments from Obama build on a series of statements the former President has made about the race for his old job, injecting the popular Democrat into a nomination fight that he had largely avoided.

""Everybody needs to chill out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process,"" Obama said after a lengthy answer that defend the arduous primary process that Democrats are currently in.

Obama, until recently, rarely commented on the 2020 field, but at a fundraiser here in Silicon Valley on Thursday the President cheered on the vigorous debate happening inside the party while stressing the need to get elected and warned about some of the obstacles the numerous women candidates and one gay candidate will likely face.

Obama did not mention any of the candidates by name, but it was clear that the former President -- whose legacy continues to loom large over the party -- is watching the debate play out with a close eye on how the candidates are positioning themselves to defeat President Donald Trump.

And the comments come as the field of Democrats vying to take on Trump has fluctuated in recent weeks with former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launching a late-entry presidential campaign last week . Patrick, who is a close friend to Obama, largely jumped into the race of fear over the state of the current crop of Democrats could not beat Trump.

""There will be differences,"" Obama said about the candidates, ""but I want us to make sure that we keep in mind that, relative to the ultimate goal, which is to defeat a president and a party that has ... taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country,"" those differences are ""relatively minor.""

The former President added it was important to draw a line between contentious arguments playing out inside the party and the need to get elected, decrying ""purity tests"" because ""the country's complicated.""

""Those are good arguments to have,"" he said about debates of health care and climate change, ""but you got to win the election.""

He also cautioned Democratic voters from getting too wrapped up in the issues they have with individual candidates, telling the audience in California that people's ""flaws are magnified"" during a primary.

""The field will narrow and there's going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care,"" Obama said bluntly, ""because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.""

The roughly 100-person fundraiser was hosted by Karla Jurvetson, a physician-turned-Democratic megadonor. Jurvetson was previously married to Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who sits on the board of SpaceX and Tesla.

The highest priced tickets to the event went for $355,000, which guests paid to ""chair the event"" and attend a private ""VIP reception"" with the former President. Entry level tickets cost $10,000. Event attendees included Steph Curry, the All-Star guard for the Golden State Warriors, and his wife, actress and author Ayesha Curry.

The event benefits the DNC's Democratic Unity Fund, a cache of money that will is being raised to eventually benefit the party's general election campaign. This is Obama's first event of the cycle for the DNC.

Obama's comments follow similar statements he made earlier this month, where he urged the 2020 candidates to ""pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" warning them about going so far on certain policies that they become out of step with voters.

""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said last week, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

Those statements -- at the time -- were particularly noteworthy for Obama. But the President has now made a series of comments about the field, signaling that he may be interested in having more of a say in the race than previously understood.

One issue Obama spoke at length about on Thursday was income inequality, where he urged Democrats to ""push hard"" on the issue, arguing that this is ""an area where the room to talk about this in bold ways is greater than it was in 2008.""

""I think it is very important for the Democratic Party to be clear and bold about saying ... we are going to initiate structural changes that reduce that inequality,"" Obama said.

A number of Democratic candidates -- including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- have made fighting income inequality central to their campaigns and Obama said he believes it's one area where there is more room now for Democrats to go big.

""It is something we were aware of in 2008 and we wanted to do more about, but the first thing was putting out a big fire to make sure we didn't have a great depression,"" Obama said of the issue.

The former President also specifically related questions about his race in 2008 to headwinds the numerous women running for president and the one gay candidate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, could face in the future.

""We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate and those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination or if they win the general election just like I did,"" Obama said, adding that there were many people in 2008 who said, ""I don't know about Barack Hussein Obama.""

But, Obama said, those candidates can ""overcome that resistance"" if they are able to fame issues and have a message that shows them as ""part of an American tradition of opening up opportunity and making room for people and treating everybody fairly."""

Pete Buttigieg defend his level of experience on Wednesday in contentious exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, using the debate to argue “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.”

The most contentious point of Buttigieg’s defense came when the mayor said, “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country.”

Buttigieg’s experience – he leads a city of just over 100,000 people, has only ever been elected by a few voters thousand and lost his only statewide election – has been a central question about his candidacy. And it was clear on Wednesday that his competitors came into the debate looking to questions his qualifications.

When Buttigieg mentioned voting rights, Klobuchar jumped in and said the issue is a “good example of where (Buttigieg) has said the right words” but not followed it up with action and called the mayor a “local official.”

“I have actually done this work,” Klobuchar said.

Buttigieg fired back.

“Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said, nodding not only his time as mayor, but his experience as a war veteran.

“I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late,” Buttigieg said.

Then Gabbard jumped and said Buttigieg showed a lack of judgment when he suggested using the U.S. military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.

“That is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics, Buttigieg responded. “Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? … I’m talking about building alliances.”

The mayor then hit Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“Let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad,” Buttigieg said.

Gabbard responded by noting how past leaders met with opposing leaders, citing when President John F. Kennedy met with Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev and former President Franklin Roosevelt met with Russian leader Joseph Stalin.

Buttigieg interrupted, “Like Donald Trump who met with Kim,” a nod to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un."

Fifty-three percent of poll respondents said they oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president, while only 40 percent support it. The poll of 801 Wisconsin registered voters was conducted between November 13 and November 17.

The poll of the key battleground state President Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by just 22,000 votes had more good news for the president.

President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

Trump’s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here:

President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Bernie Sanders 45 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.

President Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent

President Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent

Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters.

Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent.

Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent.

Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation.

Only 32 percent of respondents said they “followed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives” very closely.

Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all.

The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president.

Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president’s conduct in office.

Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don’t know.

Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid.

On the bigger question of whether he did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.

While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong, while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so.

The president’s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters.

Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president’s job performance either “strongly” or “somewhat,” while 47 percent approve of his job performance “strongly” or “somewhat.”

The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it.

Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent."

(CNN) In my career, I've never been accused of grade inflation but I found Wednesday evening's debate to be the best overall this season -- so my grade book runneth over. My two As really were a tie at the top.

A

Pete Buttigieg

Mayor Pete demonstrated some sweet debating techniques that I teach, yet rarely see deployed as well as he did last night. He pivoted questions to keep his answers on topic, but still unique from the other candidates -- and by doing so he provided himself with an advantage.

Buttigieg struck on one key point that, as he noted, has been largely swept under the rug: ""The President had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans."" Many Democrats will agree that the country needed to hear somebody on a national stage emphasize that important point.

But Buttigieg was not a one-trick pony. Far from it. Let's examine his defense. He smoothly reframed the attacks that were leveled at him so that they played to his advantage. For instance, he was asked why he's a candidate worth backing, given that he lost his only statewide election. He replied that, while he may not have ""traditional establishment Washington experience,"" that's not necessarily what the country needs. And when Senator Amy Klobuchar raised the point again, he shot back, saying, ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Buttigieg made it clear that he isn't going to roll over for anybody, especially Donald Trump. Voters needed to see well-harnessed assertiveness, and Buttigieg's tone and demeanor were just right this time.

Andrew Yang

I don't grade on a lack of speaking time, since it's not the candidate's fault. I coach my teams to make fewer arguments than our competitors, but to make sure the positions we take are thorough and well-grounded.

That said, I dare you to find a bad answer from Andrew Yang in last night's debate. Hint: You won't. He scored an A from me every single time he spoke. I've never witnessed that before.

While it was well into the debate before Yang spoke, his answers about some of the threats to American society once again, brought new ideas to the debate stage. Artificial intelligence, which he's mentioned in previous debates, is a future threat that must be taken seriously. And setting up something like a WTO (World Trade Organization) for data? His ingenuity was astounding. Bold ideas suit Yang well -- and, when well thought out and pragmatic, they get high points in a debate.

A-

Kamala Harris

She's a master at criticizing others without coming across as a jerk. She called out Tulsi Gabbard for spending ""four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama"" before going on to admonish her efforts to be chummy with Trump and Steve Bannon, and her criticism of the Democratic party. It was a horrible look for Gabbard.

On policy, Harris also shone. She displayed great knowledge of foreign policy, North Korea, race and women's issues, and rebuilding Democratic coalitions.

A-

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has found his groove in the last two debates. But he wasn't perfect. For example, he should have given a more direct answer to the question about whether chants of ""locking him up"" (referring to Donald Trump) should be discouraged.

He did have strong moments, however. In a clever pivot, when asked to defend how Medicare for All is a ""revolution,"" Sanders pointed to the ""cruel"" and ""dysfunctional"" health care system before backing his answer up with statistics on how many Americans go bankrupt over medical bills.

Sanders was also excellent on answers about the need to work now to fix climate change and his willingness to deal with controversial adversaries from the Taliban to Saudi Arabia and Iran.

B+

Elizabeth Warren

I'm a sucker for folding breaking news into a debate, and Warren put selling ambassadorships front and center after Gordon Sondland's impeachment testimony yesterday. Well done indeed.

Even better was when she articulated her three-year plan for Medicare for All, and it answered many questions that have been posed in the past. She needs to continue adding this to her answer. She also had a sharp explanation about the fact that we subsidize white, but not black wealth through housing. I lowered her score a bit due to her response that the number of people who serve in the military should be higher; while she gave a heartfelt answer about the benefit of service to the country, she didn't clarify whether she believes the military could use a larger number of troops.

B

Cory Booker

Logical flaws are not an issue with the senator. Booker had an interesting answer on abortion by linking it to voter suppression. He also spoke intelligently about homeownership and gentrification.

But in some areas, he came up short. His best criticism of Biden was off-topic. Booker was asked an important question about Trump's border wall, but he gave a two-line response before turning to a discussion of race and marijuana, and using it as an opportunity to attack Biden.

If candidates chose to ignore the question and pivot to that they think are their best positions instead, what are the moderators for?

B-

Joe Biden

I teach my debaters the importance of every single word. You can lose a debate by simply saying the wrong word at the wrong time. Enter Joe Biden.

Yes, he made a couple of big gaffes. You don't use the word ""punching"" when emphasizing a talking point about domestic violence. And it matters. You don't refer to the ""only African-American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate."" (Another one was standing on stage with you, Joe.) His defense was that he thought he said ""first,"" but he didn't. He said ""only."" And it matters. These small mistakes might have not been a huge setback for any other candidate, but they are magnified because of Biden's history of slip-ups.

I'm predicting pundits will focus on those two incidents and lose track of the bigger picture, which is that Biden was having his best debate yet. His ""only"" mistake overshadowed a great response to Booker's attack about legalizing marijuana. Decriminalize it, and let out those who are jailed because of it.

Apart from the mess-ups, Biden was on a roll. Plus, his critique of Tom Steyer for having invested in the coal industry hit home.

B-

Amy Klobuchar

If there's one thing we know about Amy Klobuchar, it's that she loves a good canned line. Actually, I enjoyed one too — her quip about receiving $17k for her campaign from her ex-boyfriends was kind of funny, for a change.

Klobuchar had many thoughtful answers on everything from voter suppression to women being held to a higher standard, to abortion. Her biggest error was criticizing Buttigieg's lack of experience, and she ended up getting the worst of the exchange when Buttigieg responded with a sharp answer.

C-

Tom Steyer

He still needs a public speaking coach. His eye contact with the moderators was better at first, but by the end of the debate, they were again fixated on the camera.

It didn't help his grade that Biden accused him of ties to the coal industry prior to his turn to politics, while others were fighting for the environment.

Guilt is a weird motivator. And Steyer had no good answer to this criticism.

On a positive note, he had a good answer about addressing homelessness.

D-

Tulsi Gabbard

She was called out by both Harris and Buttigieg -- effectively.

Gabbard had a good answer on the reform needed in the criminal justice system, but then mistakenly pivoted from it to preaching about treating people with respect. She should have stayed on topic.

She could have given a thoughtful answer about climate change but she instead said it was not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is coming from a candidate who has appeared on conservative television and radio, where climate change is used as a wedge issue between the scientific community and the public. Voters (and debate coaches) will at best see this as an insincere attempt to preach unity and at worst see it as deeply hypocritical."

In Wednesday night's debate , the party's leading contenders offered their clearest arguments yet about how they plan to do that.

Subtly jabbing their rivals, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris said that Democrats can't win without rebuilding former President Barack Obama's diverse coalition of supporters.

""The question black women voters have for us as candidates is: Where you been, and what are you gonna do?"" Harris said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden also staked a claim to the Obama coalition, but stumbled into an awkward moment while doing so.

Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders used his closing statement to try to reach Latinos, a crucial part of the electorate in Nevada -- the third state to vote in the Democratic nominating process and key for Biden -- as well as California and Texas, which will award huge swaths of delegates on Super Tuesday.

""I am the son of an immigrant,"" he said. ""I have some sense of an immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.""

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar made her most forceful case yet that her history of winning in red and purple portions of the Midwest -- despite the reality that in politics, ""women have to work harder"" -- give her a strong claim to the centrist lane in the 2020 primary field.

And South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who has rocketed to the top of Iowa polls in recent weeks, fended off Klobuchar's characterization of him as merely a ""local official"" and questions about his virtually nonexistent support from African Americans.

Here are eight takeaways from the fifth Democratic presidential debate:

Buttigieg on defense

Buttigieg's rise to the top of the Iowa polls meant he entered Wednesday night with the biggest target on his back.

Those attacks primarily came later in the debate. Buttigieg largely emerged from the night unscathed -- a relief for his campaign, which knew his opponents were more eager than ever to knock him down.

The first contender to take direct aim at Buttigieg was Klobuchar, who questioned his experience and chided the small-city mayor as a ""local official.""

Buttigieg responded by quickly pivoting to an attack on Washington.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" he said. ""There is more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country?""

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also took a swing, saying Buttigieg lacked judgment when he suggested using the US military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.

Buttigieg called her claim ""outlandish, even by the standards of today's politics"" and criticized her for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

And Harris implicitly knocked Buttigieg for his struggles with courting black voters. Buttigieg accepted her criticism -- ""I completely agree,"" he said to the California senator -- and then acknowledged that the lack of African American support is a problem but said he will ""welcome the challenge.""

Then, there were more subtle jabs -- like when Booker noted that he is the ""other Rhodes Scholar"" in the race. But for all but the most engaged viewers, those moments might not have registered.

Klobuchar's electability argument

Klobuchar had a clear goal Wednesday night: Plant serious doubt in Democratic voters' minds that Biden is the most electable candidate and that Buttigieg is the voice of the Midwest.

She hit those marks more effectively than ever before.

Contrasting herself with Buttigieg, Klobuchar said that ""women have to work harder, and that's a fact."" Then, she transitioned into the hard work she's done: Winning even the red and purple congressional districts in her battleground state, and then playing a role in the passage of a long list of legislation in the Senate.

She also took a broad shot at progressive policy goals like ""Medicare for All"" and free college tuition.

""I'm not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" she said.

It's far from clear that Klobuchar changed her trajectory in any major way. Her campaign is built entirely on the prospect of a strong finish in Iowa, where polls show her moving into the mid-single digits but still far from the 15% threshold she'll need to hit at individual caucus sites to actually pick up delegates. And the core of her argument -- that many bold ideas with broad support among progressives are unserious -- might not motivate many voters.

But the Minnesota senator's play is for the center lane. And on Wednesday, she mounted her clearest case yet that her record and electoral history in Minnesota are assets Biden and Buttigieg don't have.

Biden's stumbles

Biden walked himself into several awkward moments in the latter portion of Wednesday night's debate.

One came when he was asked about domestic violence. Biden had pointed out that he'd written the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, but then said of continuing to combat the problem: ""We have to keep punching at it, and punching at it, and punching at it.""

Another came when Biden -- attempting to reference former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, who is a strong backer of his campaign -- claimed to have been endorsed by ""the only African American woman who's ever been elected to the United States Senate.""

Booker quickly said, ""That's not true."" And Harris, the second black woman elected to the Senate, said, ""I'm standing right here"" -- and then laughed.

Correcting himself, Biden said, ""I said the first.""

The former vice president also had strong moments. Much of the debate's second half focused on foreign policy, and at one point, in a moment that would mark a significant break from US policy, Biden pledged to end weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and treat the country like ""the pariah that they are.""

Booker hits Biden on marijuana legalization

The exchange over black voters started when Booker chastised Biden over marijuana. The former vice president had said days earlier that he is opposed to legalizing marijuana on the federal level, saying he wants more research into whether it's a ""gateway drug.""

""I thought you might have been high when you said it,"" Booker said.

The New Jersey senator has long advocated for the federal government to legalize marijuana. So have all the other leading Democratic contenders -- except Biden.

To be clear, Biden's position on marijuana legalization is well to the left of existing federal policy. He argued that marijuana should be decriminalized, with all marijuana arrests expunged from the records of those convicted. He has also said marijuana should be removed from the list of Schedule I drugs so that researchers can study its effects.

But Booker was arguing that legalizing marijuana is a matter of racial justice, and that Democrats won't be able to rebuild the coalition of voters assembled by Barack Obama if black voters are alienated. He specifically pointed to a drop in black turnout in Wisconsin in the 2016 election.

Biden, touting his endorsements from black congressional leaders and his strong poll numbers with African-American voters nationwide and especially in South Carolina, said, ""I'm talking to that Obama coalition. I come out of the black community, in terms of my support.""

Bernie Sanders keeps climate change in the conversation

The question was about Democrats who chant ""Lock him up!"" at the mention of President Trump, and whether he approved, but Sanders had something else on his mind: climate change.

""When you talk about the climate crisis,"" Sanders said, though no one was, ""the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real, they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.""

Later on, when the moderators did ask about climate change, Sanders took exception with their framing.

""Your questioner said, 'What are we going to do in decades?' We don't have decades,"" Sanders said. ""What the scientists are telling us is, if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities, going under water.""

He went on to tick off the potential catastrophes that lie ahead, in particular the potential for a climate refugee crisis that sets off a national security emergency. Sanders also took a page from his Green New Deal plan, suggesting that fossil fuel companies should face legal scrutiny for misleading the public.

""They have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe,"" Sanders said, ""we should think about prosecuting them as well.""

Obama legacy looms large

Former President Barack Obama left office three years ago, but on Wednesday night, his legacy hovered over the Democrats vying for the job he once held.

Buttigieg turned a question about unity toward the former president. Harris defended Obama as a way to attack Gabbard. And a host of candidates -- led by Biden -- touted their ability to rebuild the coalition of voters that elected Obama.

The focus on Obama came days after the former president made his most political comments in months. The former president, in comments to donors last week, urged 2020 Democrats to by ""rooted in reality"" to avoid turning off key swaths of the electorate and not to be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

With Obama in the news, the candidates responded.

""As President Obama commented recently, we are not in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago,"" Buttigieg said.

""I think it's unfortunate that we have someone on this stage that is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for the president of the United States who during the Obama administration has spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,"" Harris said to Gabbard.

The politics around Obama and the current debate remain complicated. He is -- by far -- the most popular Democrat in the country, making it difficult to criticize him, even though some candidates have outlined policy differences on issues like deportations.

On Wednesday night, though, it was all praise.

""We're aiming to do in this cycle is build off that progress,"" said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who was Obama's labor secretary. ""Not reflect on some nostalgia, but reflect on the remarkable lessons of how we can indeed get things done.""

Impeachment dominates the day

For the first time, a Democratic presidential debate wasn't the biggest political story on the day it took place.

The explosive testimony in the House's impeachment inquiry dominated headlines and cable news all day Wednesday, and -- even though there is no real disagreement among the Democratic candidates that Trump should be impeached -- it was the first topic moderators raised.

Sanders urged Democrats to focus on policy matters, rather than just Trump's impeachment.

""He is likely the most corrupt President in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump. Because if we are, we are going to lose the election,"" Sanders said.

Warren, meanwhile, used the topic to highlight her pledge to break Washington's long-standing pattern of top campaign donors receiving ambassadorships -- such as Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union who gave $1 million to his inauguration fund.

""We are not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder,"" Warren said.

Exhaustion on health care

The first four Democratic debates featured lengthy clashes between the progressive and moderate candidates over health care: whether to push for Medicare for All or instead attempt go the less costly route of expanding Obamacare with a public option.

Nobody wanted a fifth round.

The candidates didn't press to go there. The audience -- at least those chattering about it on social media -- had no appetite for it. And the moderators only hit health care in a perfunctory way.

Each of the four leading candidates quickly hit their marks. Buttigieg touted his ""Medicare for all who want it"" plan. Biden questioned the cost of Medicare for All. Warren touted her new plan. Sanders recycled his laugh line, thanking the moderators for going to him and saying, ""I wrote the damn bill.""

And then everyone seemed happy to move on."

PBS NewsHour is partnering with Politico to produce the debate on December 19 from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. At least six Democrats have qualified to participate: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Candidates have until December 12 to meet the qualifying criteria established by the Democratic National Committee and its partners to receive an invitation to the debate.

The debate comes during tumultuous times in US history, shaped by ongoing presidential impeachment proceedings in Washington, and a country deeply divided along ideological lines.

The House impeachment proceedings are expected to continue through December, and if the House impeaches President Donald Trump, the Senate will likely take it up in January. Six of the Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination currently serve as US senators and will need to be in Washington if the Senate convenes a trial. This will make the December debate even more critical as it could be the last time these candidates will have a national stage until the next debate in January.

(AP) — Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of his former Vice President Joe Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can defeat President Donald Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

He also noted the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which now includes five women, three black candidates, a Latino man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation’s first black president.

“We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election — just like I did,” Obama told donors. “You can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, ’Look, I’m part of an American tradition … of opening up opportunity.”

In recent weeks Obama has sought to play both referee and uplifting elder statesman. He’s cautioned “woke” activists against embracing “cancel culture” and urged the party to not adopt positions that could cost them in the general election.

“That’s not bringing about change,” he said during a recent Obama Foundation event. “If all you are doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far.”

At the same time, he has offered reassurances that a spirited primary will make the eventual nominee a stronger candidate.

It comes amid a fierce intraparty debate that has divided centrists and an ascendant progressive wing, which has advocated for policies like free college tuition and “Medicare for All” that would dramatically reshape the role of government in peoples’ lives.

Elections are ultimately won by offering a message that appeals to voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama said.

“We should not be somehow thinking either we’re going for our base voter of young hipsters and African Americans and single women versus Joe lunch-pail, hard-hat guy,” he said. “Because you know what? … I’ve had conversations with all those groups, and they share common dreams and common hopes and a vision for what a fair, just America would look like.”

The fundraiser Thursday was held at the home of Karla Jurvetson, a prominent Democratic donor and Silicon Valley philanthropist. The event raised more than $3 million for the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior party official."

1. Impeachment investigation

It seems like the words ""dramatic"" and ""bombshell"" are thrown around a lot in reference to the impeachment inquiry hearings, but if there were ever a time to use them, it would be to describe yesterday's testimony from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland . Right out of the gate, Sondland confirmed that, yes, a ""quid pro quo"" scheme existed and President Trump directed it. He also said ""everyone was in the loop"" about what was going on with Ukraine foreign policy, implicating top officials including Vice President Mike Pence. Sondland's testimony punched several gaping holes in the Trump administration's defense of the Ukraine saga. For one, Sondland said he got the impression Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn't actually have to conduct the investigations; he just had to announce them. If he's correct, that lends credence to the theory that the probes were simply a political maneuver. Sondland's testimony was especially important for Democrats because he is one of the main witnesses to have had direct contact with the President during the time of the Ukraine dealings.

3. Israel

Israel may be heading for its third presidential election in 12 months. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried and failed to form a government after September's election, his opponent, former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, got the opportunity to take power and form one himself. But Gantz announced yesterday that his Blue and White party hasn't been able to gather the necessary coalition in four solid weeks of negotiations . Now, Israel is in unprecedented political territory. For the next 21 days, any member of the Israeli legislature, known as the Knesset, could potentially become Prime Minister, if they gather a political majority. If that fails, it would be back to the polls for an election-weary public.

There is serious trouble brewing with the United Auto Workers, one of the most powerful unions in the country. UAW's executive board took steps to remove its president , Gary Jones, and expel him from the union following allegations of bribery and misuse of union funds. So far, 10 people have pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges surrounding the scandal. Some of those charges involve bribes paid to union officials by executives at Fiat Chrysler. And now, fellow automaker GM is suing Fiat Chrysler , saying the latter engaged in corrupt bargaining with UAW. Fiat Chrysler called the charges in the suit ""meritless"" and will fight them in court. If you'll recall, the UAW recently waged a six-week strike at GM that cost the automaker an estimated $2.9 billion.

Breitbart News Senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak ventured into the crowd to speak to Buttigieg fans — as well as supporters of businessman Andrew Yang and former Vice President Joe Biden, the other two campaigns represented outside the Tyler Perry Studios.

“It’s unusual to have a mayor run for president, and you mentioned his experience — what do you think is his biggest achievement in South Bend?” Pollak asked.

“You got me on that one!” the Buttigieg supporter laughed, holding his “Pete” sign up to block the camera, in jest.

“Let me think about that one, okay?” he said.

Other Buttigieg supporters named his military service and his intelligence as reasons to support him. But none could name anything he had actually achieved in public service.

Asked what his biggest achievement was in South Bend — or even “somewhere else” –one woman answered: “I don’t know about that particularly. I know the thing in his resume, let’s say, that’s most impressive to me is that he is a military vet.”

Another woman, who had previously cited Buttigieg’s “experience,” struggled to answer the same question.

“Yes, that’s his first experience, although he’s been mayor, I think, for eight years. He’s had challenges — sometimes when you have a smaller operation, it’s tougher, even, than running a big city. You have fewer resources. He’s had hits and misses, but he’s learned from that and he’s trying to do better.”

The full video of Breitbart’s foray into the crowd is available at Breitbart News’ Facebook page, here.

Buttigieg is leading in the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, though he still trails the frontrunners nationwide."

“We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off a trade war that should not have started in the first place,” Pete Buttigieg said during the fifth Democrat debate.

The South Bend mayor commented in response to a question from MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow, who asked him if he would keep President Trump’s subsidies in place if elected president.

“I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers,” Buttigieg claimed. “He keeps asking them to take one for the team … they’re not going to benefit from business as usual from the president.”

A November survey from Iowa State University showed that farmers largely view the trade disruption from Trump’s fight with China as short-term pain for long-term gain.

Buttigieg went on to discuss how to help farmers combat climate change by building “climate-neutral farms” before he was interrupted.

Maddow pressed Buttigieg to say whether or not he would still support Trump’s subsidies for farms.

“Yes,” he replied. “But we won’t need them because we’re going to fix the trade war.”"

Buttigieg said that President Trump’s “impeachable conduct” is part of the campaign.

He added, “Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess, in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end, one way or the other.”

11:50 PM: Warren just not appealing to people like Peter Gammons…. and David Gergen:

David Gergen on Elizabeth Warren: ""There's a hectoring quality there"" pic.twitter.com/4j1dBUXgvk — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) November 21, 2019

11:39 PM: MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell says Biden’s screw up re: Harris/Moseley Braun was unlike anything he has ever seen in a debate because he forgot that Harris existed. He said Biden had a great debate up until that point and said that gaffe was as bad as it could have gotten for the former vice president.

11:30 PM:

The fifth Democratic debate has wrapped up! Warren spoke the most, followed by Buttigieg. Yang got the least speaking time. https://t.co/hThjmRLpvy pic.twitter.com/fbld4slcjZ — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a “moral moment” right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, “good trouble.” He asks Americans to keep him on the stage.

Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the “criminal in the White House.” He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that “Mr. Trump” is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument.

Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect– “Aloha” values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the “Aloha spirit” when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says “let’s make Dr. King’s dream a reality.”

Yang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for.

He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now.

Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can’t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery.

Harris says we’re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests… she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America’s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices.

Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class.

He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building.

Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history.

Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan.

Biden says he hopes Warren wasn’t talking about the “spotless” Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the “woe is me” attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: “Get up and take it back.”

11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization’s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a “sweeping victory.”

10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg’s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his “inexperience” and cites his recent “careless statement” about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a “murderous dictator like that” (Assad).

Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes.

Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev.

10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over “Washington experience” after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us.

10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a “human right” and an “economic right” when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party.

Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don’t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies.

10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should “codify Roe v. Wade into law.” She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election.

10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if “he was high” when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850.

Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren’t those candidates.

Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. “Everyone gets out, records expunged,” Biden says. Biden says he “comes out of the black community” in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials.

Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: “Nope… The other one’s here.”

Biden misspeaks and says he had support from ""the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate,"" before correcting that he meant ""first."" Harris's reaction:pic.twitter.com/oIL1hcMfWS — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019

10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses.

10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an “economic justice” issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will “close the black-white” income gap.

10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country.

10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts.

Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them.

10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says “we have to fundamentally change the culture” re: how women are treated. He talks about the “it’s on us” movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women’s issues by keep “punching at it.”

10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way.

10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we “set the record straight” and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system.

10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks.

10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems.

He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians.

He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but “it is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.” He says America must treat Palestinians with “respect.”

10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah.

Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China.

10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump’s “transactional” foreign policy. He says Trump’s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy.

10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House.

Yang says he will say he is sorry that “I beat your guy.” He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America’s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO.

He says he will propose a new world data organization–like the WTO for data.

Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses.

10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban.

Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the “terrible war in Iraq” while he voted against it.

Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so.

10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years.

Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they “view that as a threat, it’s an easy thing to respond to” by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he’s re: Korea.

10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions.

Harris uses the question to say: “Donald Trump got punked.”

She says Trump “has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego.”

She says Trump is the greatest threat to national security and says she won’t make concessions because there are none to make right now.

10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC’s playbook, says we don’t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says “climate refugees” will cause national security problems all over the world.

He says the fossil fuel industry is “criminally liable” for lying about climate change and “maybe we should prosecute them as well.”

10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won’t say it. Warren won’t say it. He says he will declare a “state of emergency” and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy.

Biden says climate change is “the existential threat to humanity.” He says he doesn’t need a “lecture from my friend” on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than “all of Great Britain produces” while he was passing climate legislation.

Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate.

10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats.

10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump’s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump’s “trade war” that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans.

9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction).

9:53 PM: Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed.

9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight.

Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C’mon.

Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate.

9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like “poker chips” in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible.

Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today.

Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris’s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates.

9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids.

9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say “lock him up” because “it’s about civility” and we need to restore the soul of the country.

Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings.

Biden says Trump has “indicted himself.” Biden says there are two questions–whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general.

9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting “lock him up” at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders’ rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that.

Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted.

9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed.

9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world’s leaders. Sounds very establishment.

9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president.

Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It’s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don’t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with?

9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he “comes from the kind of communities” that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses.

9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: “Thank you, Andrew.”

Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang’s whole campaign theme is that today’s politician don’t understand threat of the future like AI, etc.

9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says

9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network:

Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)? This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip up. Unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/2vJrYx5DKQ — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) November 17, 2019

9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals?

9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the “rot” she she’s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the “foreign policy establishment” in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war.

Harris is asked to respond and she says “it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage” who wants to be the party’s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and “buddying up to Steve Bannon.” Harris is months late on this comeback–and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short.

9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don’t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn’t and then talks about a health care system that is “cruel and dysfunctional.” He says “some of the people up here” think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He’s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn’t mention them by name.

Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch.

9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to “feel it” and “taste it” after the third year, people are going to want it.

Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: “Thank you, I wrote the damn bill.”

9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can “galvanize” and not “polarize.” He pitches his “Medicare for all who want it” plan and says Democrats should not be “commanding” people to get Medicare.

9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her “two cents” wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren’s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth.

Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard.

It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the “moderate” candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage.

Warren says she is “tired of freeloading billionaires” and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish.

9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says “we have a criminal in the White House.” Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail.

9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated.

“Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee,” Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn’t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell’s question. Mitchell doesn’t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity.

9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump’s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a “tender” moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed.

9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a “pathological liar” who is the “most corrupt president” in modern history when asked how central Trump’s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can “walk and chew bubble gum at the same time” by dealing with Trump’s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the “rigged economy.”

9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won’t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery.

9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course.

Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale.

9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including “national security, race, and climate.”

8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an “anti-Trump” party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms.

8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate:

8:39 PM: Can Mayor Pete take the heat tonight? Will his poll numbers hold after tonight’s debate?

Nina Turner of the Sander campaign, speaking for herself, ripped Buttigieg last night. And he’s going to face a lot more of that as Iowa gets nearer. Candidates like Harris and Warren who had polling surges going into the debates lost their momentum after the debates.

A message from Stacey Abrams, who is on stage firing up the crowd before the debate begins. She may fit today’s “woke” Democrats who want to leave no identity group behind as well as Ed Orgeron just fits LSU. She may regret years down the line that she didn’t get into a race that was hers for the taking. Opportunities like this do not present themselves often. Obama seized his chance.

Warren, while still a top tier candidate, fell to third place in the latest Emerson poll, which was taken November 17-20, 2019, among 1,029 registered voters. Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid.

The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters.

Per Emerson:

Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. … Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%.

No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:

“Biden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months – yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,” Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said.

The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren’s 18.5 percent.

Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening’s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in."

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) claimed that Stacey Abrams would have won the gubernatorial election in Georgia if not for “voting purges.”

Last year, Abrams lost her bid for Georgia governor to Gov. Brian Kemp (R). During Wednesday night’s debate, Klobuchar claimed this was due to statewide voter suppression:

I have led the way on voting and I can tell you right now one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be to allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this and we do something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges … Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now. [Emphasis added]

Klobuchar’s claim, though, is untrue and has been previously debunked by the Washington Post when Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) made a similar claim.

“Abrams fell short by 55,000 votes out of nearly 4 million cast, in a case filled with election mischief and fierce disputes,” the Post fact check states. “Buttigieg should not be so definitive in his assertion that Abrams would have won if not for racially motivated measures.”

Similarly, a report by the United States Election Assistance Commission debunked claims that Georgia voters are experiencing unprecedented voter suppression in state elections. The report revealed that Georgia ranks as number one for automated voter registration and has higher absentee ballot acceptance rates compared to past elections.

Georgia was the number one state for automated voter registration and showed significantly higher percentages of accepted absentee and provisional ballots compared to previous elections. Between 2016 and 2018, more than 3.5 million voters in Georgia registered to vote or updated their voter information — the most voters in any state in the nation.

A Brennan Center for Justice study also found that Georgia had a nearly 94 percent increase in voter registrations due to automated voter registration, also more than any state in the nation.

The comments from Obama build on a series of statements the former President has made about the race for his old job, injecting the popular Democrat into a nomination fight that he had largely avoided.

""Everybody needs to chill out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process,"" Obama said after a lengthy answer that defend the arduous primary process that Democrats are currently in.

Obama, until recently, rarely commented on the 2020 field, but at a fundraiser here in Silicon Valley on Thursday the President cheered on the vigorous debate happening inside the party while stressing the need to get elected and warned about some of the obstacles the numerous women candidates and one gay candidate will likely face.

Obama did not mention any of the candidates by name, but it was clear that the former President -- whose legacy continues to loom large over the party -- is watching the debate play out with a close eye on how the candidates are positioning themselves to defeat President Donald Trump.

And the comments come as the field of Democrats vying to take on Trump has fluctuated in recent weeks with former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launching a late-entry presidential campaign last week . Patrick, who is a close friend to Obama, largely jumped into the race of fear over the state of the current crop of Democrats could not beat Trump.

""There will be differences,"" Obama said about the candidates, ""but I want us to make sure that we keep in mind that, relative to the ultimate goal, which is to defeat a president and a party that has ... taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country,"" those differences are ""relatively minor.""

The former President added it was important to draw a line between contentious arguments playing out inside the party and the need to get elected, decrying ""purity tests"" because ""the country's complicated.""

""Those are good arguments to have,"" he said about debates of health care and climate change, ""but you got to win the election.""

He also cautioned Democratic voters from getting too wrapped up in the issues they have with individual candidates, telling the audience in California that people's ""flaws are magnified"" during a primary.

""The field will narrow and there's going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care,"" Obama said bluntly, ""because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.""

The roughly 100-person fundraiser was hosted by Karla Jurvetson, a physician-turned-Democratic megadonor. Jurvetson was previously married to Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who sits on the board of SpaceX and Tesla.

The highest priced tickets to the event went for $355,000, which guests paid to ""chair the event"" and attend a private ""VIP reception"" with the former President. Entry level tickets cost $10,000. Event attendees included Steph Curry, the All-Star guard for the Golden State Warriors, and his wife, actress and author Ayesha Curry.

The event benefits the DNC's Democratic Unity Fund, a cache of money that will is being raised to eventually benefit the party's general election campaign. This is Obama's first event of the cycle for the DNC.

Obama's comments follow similar statements he made earlier this month, where he urged the 2020 candidates to ""pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" warning them about going so far on certain policies that they become out of step with voters.

""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said last week, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""diluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

Those statements -- at the time -- were particularly noteworthy for Obama. But the President has now made a series of comments about the field, signaling that he may be interested in having more of a say in the race than previously understood.

One issue Obama spoke at length about on Thursday was income inequality, where he urged Democrats to ""push hard"" on the issue, arguing that this is ""an area where the room to talk about this in bold ways is greater than it was in 2008.""

""I think it is very important for the Democratic Party to be clear and bold about saying ... we are going to initiate structural changes that reduce that inequality,"" Obama said.

A number of Democratic candidates -- including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- have made fighting income inequality central to their campaigns and Obama said he believes it's one area where there is more room now for Democrats to go big.

""It is something we were aware of in 2008 and we wanted to do more about, but the first thing was putting out a big fire to make sure we didn't have a great depression,"" Obama said of the issue.

The former President also specifically related questions about his race in 2008 to headwinds the numerous women running for president and the one gay candidate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, could face in the future.

""We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate and those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination or if they win the general election just like I did,"" Obama said, adding that there were many people in 2008 who said, ""I don't know about Barack Hussein Obama.""

But, Obama said, those candidates can ""overcome that resistance"" if they are able to fame issues and have a message that shows them as ""part of an American tradition of opening up opportunity and making room for people and treating everybody fairly."""

Fifty-three percent of poll respondents said they oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president, while only 40 percent support it. The poll of 801 Wisconsin registered voters was conducted between November 13 and November 17.

The poll of the key battleground state President Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by just 22,000 votes had more good news for the president.

President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

Trump’s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here:

President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Bernie Sanders 45 percent.

President Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.

President Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent

President Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent

Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters.

Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent.

Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent.

Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation.

Only 32 percent of respondents said they “followed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives” very closely.

Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all.

The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president.

Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president’s conduct in office.

Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don’t know.

Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid.

On the bigger question of whether he did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.

While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something “seriously wrong” in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong, while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so.

The president’s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters.

Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president’s job performance either “strongly” or “somewhat,” while 47 percent approve of his job performance “strongly” or “somewhat.”

The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it.

Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent."

(AP) — Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of his former Vice President Joe Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can defeat President Donald Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

He also noted the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which now includes five women, three black candidates, a Latino man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation’s first black president.

“We have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election — just like I did,” Obama told donors. “You can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, ’Look, I’m part of an American tradition … of opening up opportunity.”

In recent weeks Obama has sought to play both referee and uplifting elder statesman. He’s cautioned “woke” activists against embracing “cancel culture” and urged the party to not adopt positions that could cost them in the general election.

“That’s not bringing about change,” he said during a recent Obama Foundation event. “If all you are doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far.”

At the same time, he has offered reassurances that a spirited primary will make the eventual nominee a stronger candidate.

It comes amid a fierce intraparty debate that has divided centrists and an ascendant progressive wing, which has advocated for policies like free college tuition and “Medicare for All” that would dramatically reshape the role of government in peoples’ lives.

Elections are ultimately won by offering a message that appeals to voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama said.

“We should not be somehow thinking either we’re going for our base voter of young hipsters and African Americans and single women versus Joe lunch-pail, hard-hat guy,” he said. “Because you know what? … I’ve had conversations with all those groups, and they share common dreams and common hopes and a vision for what a fair, just America would look like.”

The fundraiser Thursday was held at the home of Karla Jurvetson, a prominent Democratic donor and Silicon Valley philanthropist. The event raised more than $3 million for the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior party official."

Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid.

The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters.

Per Emerson:

Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. … Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%.

No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:

“Biden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months – yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,” Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said.

The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren’s 18.5 percent.

Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening’s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in."

If you were spending this week focused on your job, school, health, family or just getting ready for Thanksgiving, instead of riveted to your screen, you might have the same question.

The answer: A lot.

Three days of televised House committee hearings that brought Democrats closer to impeaching President Donald Trump. A debate that exposed key differences between the 2020 candidates. A controversy over Prince Andrew's interview that led him to pull out of public life. An election in deep-red Louisiana that narrowly kept a Democrat in the governor's office. And the opening of two feel-good blockbuster movies, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" and ""Frozen 2.""

The pivotal political moment came Wednesday, when Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland gave his opening statement to the House Intelligence Committee, noted Michael D'Antonio: ""President Donald Trump's abuse of power has been confirmed by a witness with direct involvement in the scheme.""

At times, Sondland seemed almost gleeful as he outed Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and top administration figures as players in an effort to extract a political favor from Ukraine in return for vital military aid from the US.

""With his testimony, Sondland portrayed the Trump-Giuliani scheme as constructed out of lies and fantasies and characterized the schemers to be aggressive, abusive and heedless of the damage they were doing to both the United States and Ukraine. As the military aid was delayed, battles raged and soldiers died,"" D'Antonio wrote.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat. The next day, former National Security Council senior director and Russia scholar Fiona Hill decisively rejected the right-wing conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine, rather than Russia, for interfering in the 2016 US election. Hill ""told the committee and the nation that America is 'being torn apart' by the erosion of a shared idea of truth,"" wrote

""Trump and the GOP, in de facto partnership with Fox News, are creating an alternate reality for followers in which facts are what the President needs them to be.""

Trump's defenses almost entirely gone

Elie Honig, ""put to rest two mainstays of the Sondland's testimony, wrote legal analyst, ""put to rest two mainstays of the Republican battery of defenses for President Donald Trump: That the investigation was not based on firsthand information, and that there was 'no quid pro quo.'"" Honig said the last credible defense for the President is to blame it all on Giuliani going ""rogue.""

The key question now, according to former Watergate assistant prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste and Kelly B. Kramer, is whether the evidence supports the constitutional standard for impeachment and removal from office, which mentions ""bribery"" along with ""other high crimes and misdemeanors.""

While noting that ""the facts are still emerging, and there is much that we as Americans do not know about how and why President Trump acted as he did,"" Ben-Veniste and Kramer concluded that there's already "" a strong prima facie basis for concluding that the President solicited a bribe .""

Sondland's opening statement caught Republicans ""flat-footed,"" wrote Scott Jennings. But as harmful as the ambassador was to Trump's defenses, Jennings added, ""later in questioning, Sondland muddied those waters by flatly stating that 'No one told me the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.'""

Polls taken before the latest testimony show no sign that Trump is losing support as a result of the impeachment inquiry, Jennings noted, and they reveal ""the structural problems Democrats face in convincing any Republican to support their impeachment dreams. The truth is, most Americans have their minds made up on Trump one way or the other and no impeachment hearing will change that.""

John Avlon As pointed out in a piece on partisan media, ""A new Pew survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That's a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.""

A royal mess

Prince Andrew, the Duke of York

Kate Maltby. ""Even when invited to offer a closing statement, Andrew didn't offer an expression of sympathy to Epstein's victims ... In what was widely seen as a public relations disaster, Prince Andrew spoke in an interview with the BBC about his friendship with the convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein. "" The prince's lack of humanity or perspective as he answered the questions put to him was astonishing ,"" wrote""Even when invited to offer a closing statement, Andrew didn't offer an expression of sympathy to Epstein's victims ...

""He doesn't regret his friendship with Epstein, because the man's 'extraordinary ability to bring people together' gave him wonderful networking opportunities. Where else might a prince pick up networking opportunities?""

There's a larger issue, she noted. To justify the ""unearned privilege the royals enjoy,"" defenders of the system argue ""that to be raised royal is to undergo a unique educational process that by definition instils virtue and duty in those who experience it ... Prince Andrew's decision to open up to the cameras this week blew that argument out of the water.""

Mayor Pete 'unscathed'

Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg

The expected debate pile-on against Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who has been surging in Iowa polls, didn't happen in the Democrats' fifth debate, held in Atlanta Wednesday. ""He has yet to have a bad debate performance and emerged from this one unscathed,"" wrote Tara Setmayer.

""He once again exhibited policy depth on issues from health care to farm subsidies and thoughtfulness when challenged by Kamala Harris on issues of race. Buttigieg also demonstrated he can counterpunch with the best of them particularly on foreign policy.""

Todd Graham gave Buttigieg and Andrew Yang As, and ranked Kamala Harris highly: "" Debate coachgave Buttigieg and Andrew Yang As, and ranked Kamala Harris highly: "" She's a master at criticizing others without coming across as a jerk. She called out Tulsi Gabbard for spending 'four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama' before going on to admonish her for efforts to be chummy with Trump and Steve Bannon, and her criticism of the Democratic Party. It was a horrible look for Gabbard. On policy, Harris also shone ...""

At harvest time, going wild

At a farmer's market, poet Tess Taylor overheard a woman lamenting a year's worth of environmental catastrophes with the despairing conclusion, ""We're so far beyond doomed.""

Taylor understood what she meant. ""It's enraging, depressing, exhausting,"" she wrote. ""In the Bay Area newly intense firestorms come to our door, weekly. In our warming seas, the kelp forests of California are dying off, threatening ocean fishery collapse.""

And yet she found hope this year in a book that might spark conversation around the Thanksgiving table: ""Wilding."" Isabella Tree tells the story of the 700-year-old English farm she and her husband inherited. When they could no longer make a go of it, they decided to let their land go largely wild and were surprised by the result.

The process called back more dense and diverse species than even experts had imagined was possible ,"" Taylor wrote. ""Even what seemed invasive at first made sense in time: One year a meadow filled up with thistles, which seemed like a nuisance, but also provided cover for a bumper crop of beneficial insects and butterflies. Tree's love of species names buoys her discoveries along, and her careful observations about the interconnectedness of even overlooked creatures seemed to give us all reason to hope.""

A difficult holiday choice

This Thanksgiving, David Perry's family is ordering a cooked turkey, breaking with its tradition of following an elaborate recipe which uses 30-plus ingredients in its stuffing and requires ""an every-15-minute basting regime.""

Perry's mother died last year. ""It wasn't easy to make the decision to order Thanksgiving dinner this year. I wanted to do it 'right.' I wanted to re-create the memories of the cooking, to roll back time, to feel like I did when my mother was here. But that's not possible. The stress of trying was going to interfere with the more important thing: being with my family.""

Can we go back to the neighborhood now?

Sara Stewart saw ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" at the Toronto Film Festival and fought back tears. Tom Hanks portrays the children's show host Fred Rogers and it's ""pretty darn close to a must-see,"" she wrote.

""But it was when I came back home to western Pennsylvania that I really began to reflect on how much we still need Rogers, a native of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and a longtime Pittsburgh resident,"" she observed. ""We need his teachings more than ever, particularly in the complicated, deeply divided region he called home.""

She recounts moving to the small town of Indiana, Pennsylvania, from New York City four years ago. ""We hiked in the woods and kayaked in the lake. I slowly began to recognize more and more faces around town. I felt I had a community.

""Then the 2016 campaign season happened.

""I started noting frequent sightings of Confederate flags on cars. MAGA hats began to proliferate in alarming numbers; our Hillary Clinton sign disappeared from our front yard. By the time election night was winding down, I was in tears, convinced I'd unwittingly moved into a truly foreign land — one that didn't want my kind around.""

But this weekend, the town of Indiana honors its most famous native son, Jimmy Stewart, with its annual ""It's a Wonderful Life"" holiday festival, something Rogers would appreciate, Stewart wrote."

That advice came to mind as I tried to make sense of what South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — a fellow Harvard graduate — told an interviewer recently about whether he would be willing to send troops to Mexico.

It seemed to me that he answered the question by saying everything — and also nothing. Classic Harvard bullshit:

Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn’t violate Mexico’s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn’t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically — do you see a time when troops can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation — as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partner south of the border.

To summarize: he would only send troops in if American lives were at stake. But as a matter of fact, American lives are at stake, which is exactly what the interviewer said in her question. He sounded smart, but actually said nothing.

It was so confusing that when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) attacked him at the Democrat debate on Wednesday night in Atlanta, Georgia, for what he said about Mexico, Buttigieg fired back that he was talking about “cooperation,” not invasion. They were both right: his answer covered every option.

When he was asked if he would keep farm subsidies in place, Buttigieg said that the trade war with China “shouldn’t have been started in the first place.” Then he started a riff about climate change, and something he called a “carbon negative farm.”

It’s not clear how to fight climate change without confronting China, the world’s dirtiest economy. Regardless, Moderator Rachel Maddow noticed that Buttigieg hadn’t answered the question, and asked it again: “Would you continue those subsidies or not?”

His answer: “Yes, but we won’t need them because we’re going to fix the trade war.” So — all of those words, and in the end he agreed with Trump’s current policy, anyway.

When he was asked about his struggle to reach African-Americans, he agreed — and then went on to say … something (via NBC):

My response is, I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don’t yet know me. And before I share what’s in my plans, let me talk about what’s in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory. I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society. And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.

In other words: I am struggling to connect to black voters, but also I am gay, which is not black but sort of like it.

It was a non-response. He showcased his erudition but said nothing about how he would address the problem. (His solution seems to involve sucking up to Al Sharpton, despite his history of racism, antisemitism, and homophobia.)

Outside the debate, I interviewed some of Buttigieg’s supporters, who formed the single largest contingent of any campaign in Atlanta. I asked them each the same simple question: what has Mayor Pete actually achieved?

None of them could answer. That is because there is no answer. He has a great résumé — and no achievements.

James Freeman of the Wall Street Journal wondered aloud why Buttigieg’s rivals weren’t making more of the fact that his record as mayor in South Bend isn’t much of a record at all:

Mr. Buttigieg will depart the mayor’s office in January at the conclusion of his second four-year term. He’s set to leave South Bend a dangerous place with an extremely high murder rate for a city its size. … Good intensions are nice. But Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) isn’t the only one wondering how far Mr. Buttigieg can go without delivering much in the way of positive results.

Regardless, Buttigieg now leads in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, even though he trails badly nationwide. He is modeling his strategy after that of Obama, who used an early win in Iowa to shock the field and win the nomination.

But the country is still wondering whether it was worth electing a politician who had never really run anything before, and whose main qualification for office was his oratorical skill. Trump is a bullshitter — the very best bullshitter ever! — but at least he had a reputation for success.

For now, Buttigieg just offers more Harvard bullshit.

The answer: A lot.

Three days of televised House committee hearings that brought Democrats closer to impeaching President Donald Trump. A debate that exposed key differences between the 2020 candidates. A controversy over Prince Andrew's interview that led him to pull out of public life. An election in deep-red Louisiana that narrowly kept a Democrat in the governor's office.

""He doesn't regret his friendship with Epstein, because the man's 'extraordinary ability to bring people together' gave him wonderful networking opportunities. Where else might a prince pick up networking opportunities?""

There's a larger issue, she noted. To justify the ""unearned privilege the royals enjoy,"" defenders of the system argue ""that to be raised royal is to undergo a unique educational process that by definition instils virtue and duty in those who experience it ... Prince Andrew's decision to open up to the cameras this week blew that argument out of the water.""

Mayor Pete 'unscathed'

Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg

The expected debate pile-on against Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who has been surging in Iowa polls, didn't happen in the Democrats' fifth debate, held in Atlanta Wednesday. ""He has yet to have a bad debate performance and emerged from this one unscathed,"" wrote Tara Setmayer.

""He once again exhibited policy depth on issues from health care to farm subsidies and thoughtfulness when challenged by Kamala Harris on issues of race. Buttigieg also demonstrated he can counterpunch with the best of them particularly on foreign policy.""

Todd Graham gave Buttigieg and Andrew Yang As, and ranked Kamala Harris highly: "" Debate coachgave Buttigieg and Andrew Yang As, and ranked Kamala Harris highly: "" She's a master at criticizing others without coming across as a jerk. She called out Tulsi Gabbard for spending 'four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama' before going on to admonish her for efforts to be chummy with Trump and Steve Bannon, and her criticism of the Democratic Party. It was a horrible look for Gabbard. On policy, Harris also shone ...""

At harvest time, going wild

At a farmer's market, poet Tess Taylor overheard a woman lamenting a year's worth of environmental catastrophes with the despairing conclusion, ""We're so far beyond doomed.""

Taylor understood what she meant. ""It's enraging, depressing, exhausting,"" she wrote. ""In the Bay Area newly intense firestorms come to our door, weekly. In our warming seas, the kelp forests of California are dying off, threatening ocean fishery collapse.""

And yet she found hope this year in a book that might spark conversation around the Thanksgiving table: ""Wilding."" Isabella Tree tells the story of the 700-year-old English farm she and her husband inherited. When they could no longer make a go of it, they decided to let their land go largely wild and were surprised by the result.

The process called back more dense and diverse species than even experts had imagined was possible ,"" Taylor wrote. ""Even what seemed invasive at first made sense in time: One year a meadow filled up with thistles, which seemed like a nuisance, but also provided cover for a bumper crop of beneficial insects and butterflies. Tree's love of species names buoys her discoveries along, and her careful observations about the interconnectedness of even overlooked creatures seemed to give us all reason to hope.""

A difficult holiday choice

This Thanksgiving, David Perry's family is ordering a cooked turkey, breaking with its tradition of following an elaborate recipe which uses 30-plus ingredients in its stuffing and requires ""an every-15-minute basting regime.""

Perry's mother died last year. ""It wasn't easy to make the decision to order Thanksgiving dinner this year. I wanted to do it 'right.' I wanted to re-create the memories of the cooking, to roll back time, to feel like I did when my mother was here. But that's not possible. The stress of trying was going to interfere with the more important thing: being with my family.""

Sara Stewart saw ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" at the Toronto Film Festival and fought back tears. Tom Hanks portrays the children's show host Fred Rogers and it's ""pretty darn close to a must-see,"" she wrote.

""But it was when I came back home to western Pennsylvania that I really began to reflect on how much we still need Rogers, a native of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and a longtime Pittsburgh resident,"" she observed. ""We need his teachings more than ever, particularly in the complicated, deeply divided region he called home.""

She recounts moving to the small town of Indiana, Pennsylvania, from New York City four years ago. ""We hiked in the woods and kayaked in the lake. I slowly began to recognize more and more faces around town. I felt I had a community.

That advice came to mind as I tried to make sense of what South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — a fellow Harvard graduate — told an interviewer recently about whether he would be willing to send troops to Mexico.

It seemed to me that he answered the question by saying everything — and also nothing. Classic Harvard bullshit:

Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience, is there a way to deal with the cartels that doesn’t violate Mexico’s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed just about every relationship he can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we need to have a better partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a security partnership, then I would welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking less profitable by walking away from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn’t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically — do you see a time when troops can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation — as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership role if, and only if, it is welcomed by our partner south of the border.

To summarize: he would only send troops in if American lives were at stake. But as a matter of fact, American lives are at stake, which is exactly what the interviewer said in her question. He sounded smart, but actually said nothing.

It was so confusing that when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) attacked him at the Democrat debate on Wednesday night in Atlanta, Georgia, for what he said about Mexico, Buttigieg fired back that he was talking about “cooperation,” not invasion. They were both right: his answer covered every option.

When he was asked if he would keep farm subsidies in place, Buttigieg said that the trade war with China “shouldn’t have been started in the first place.” Then he started a riff about climate change, and something he called a “carbon negative farm.”

It’s not clear how to fight climate change without confronting China, the world’s dirtiest economy. Regardless, Moderator Rachel Maddow noticed that Buttigieg hadn’t answered the question, and asked it again: “Would you continue those subsidies or not?”

His answer: “Yes, but we won’t need them because we’re going to fix the trade war.” So — all of those words, and in the end he agreed with Trump’s current policy, anyway.

When he was asked about his struggle to reach African-Americans, he agreed — and then went on to say … something (via NBC):

My response is, I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don’t yet know me. And before I share what’s in my plans, let me talk about what’s in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory. I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society. And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.

In other words: I am struggling to connect to black voters, but also I am gay, which is not black but sort of like it.

It was a non-response. He showcased his erudition but said nothing about how he would address the problem. (His solution seems to involve sucking up to Al Sharpton, despite his history of racism, antisemitism, and homophobia.)

Outside the debate, I interviewed some of Buttigieg’s supporters, who formed the single largest contingent of any campaign in Atlanta. I asked them each the same simple question: what has Mayor Pete actually achieved?

None of them could answer. That is because there is no answer. He has a great résumé — and no achievements.

James Freeman of the Wall Street Journal wondered aloud why Buttigieg’s rivals weren’t making more of the fact that his record as mayor in South Bend isn’t much of a record at all:

Mr. Buttigieg will depart the mayor’s office in January at the conclusion of his second four-year term. He’s set to leave South Bend a dangerous place with an extremely high murder rate for a city its size. … Good intensions are nice. But Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) isn’t the only one wondering how far Mr. Buttigieg can go without delivering much in the way of positive results.

Regardless, Buttigieg now leads in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, even though he trails badly nationwide. He is modeling his strategy after that of Obama, who used an early win in Iowa to shock the field and win the nomination.

But the country is still wondering whether it was worth electing a politician who had never really run anything before, and whose main qualification for office was his oratorical skill. Trump is a bullshitter — the very best bullshitter ever! — but at least he had a reputation for success.

For now, Buttigieg just offers more Harvard bullshit.

After jumping to a commanding position … [+14046 chars]",Pete Buttigieg has a problem.,2019-11-26,CNN,Pete Buttigieg confronts his existential problem: Courting black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/pete-buttigieg-black-voters/index.html,"After jumping to a commanding position in Iowa and improving his chances in New Hampshire, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is confronting the real possibility that his inability to win over black voters will thwart his rise and, in the worst-case scenario for Buttigieg, sink his campaign.

Buttigieg has said for months that he needs ""help"" courting black voters and ""has a lot of work to continue to do"" in that effort. He has blamed his lack of support with African Americans on his lack of long-standing relationships that other presidential hopefuls, particularly former Vice President Joe Biden , have fostered for years.

But months removed from those first admissions, Buttigieg's standing with black voters remains unchanged. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found him at 0% with black voters in South Carolina, and even some of his more devout supporters are starting to worry whether he can overcome this deficiency. Buttigieg also lags majorly behind his top competitors in endorsements from black elected officials.

Black voters are critical to the Democratic Party, especially in South Carolina, where they will be a large and influential voting bloc in the party's electorate. But Buttigieg's inability to win black support will also hamper him in Nevada -- a state that is over 10% black and the third contest in the nominating process -- and a host of so-called Super Tuesday states like Alabama, Virginia and North Carolina, all places with large black populations that will vote on March 3.

These issues for Buttigieg were clear on a warm, late October afternoon when Buttigieg attracted what his campaign said was the largest crowd that any 2020 Democratic campaign has gathered in the state of South Carolina.

The rally was hosted in Rock Hill, a growing city that is 40% black. But you wouldn't be able to tell that from the largely white crowd that had gathered to see the South Bend mayor.

Nikita Jackson, who sits on the Rock Hill city council and introduced Buttigieg at the rally, says that event highlights that a campaign that wants to reach black has voters to go to them, not wait for black voters to come out to political events. She has urged the campaign to show up at local events rather than creating events and asking African American residents to come out, advice she says the campaign has taken.

""For working people, you cannot ask them to go outside of their norm,"" Jackson said. ""Because going outside of their norm can create chaos in their household.""

Despite her rousing introduction of Buttigieg at his rally, Jackson says she has not endorsed in the 2020 presidential race. Asked if Buttigieg is able to connect with black voters in the state, Jackson paused for several seconds.

""You can clearly see there wasn't a connection there because there wasn't a lot of African Americans there,"" Jackson finally answered. ""His campaign is doing all that they can to try to connect with the minority vote.""

Campaign slow to deploy staff to South Carolina

Buttigieg addresses the crowd at the 2019 South Carolina Democratic Party State Convention on June 22, 2019 in Columbia, South Carolina.

Buttigieg, who first gained national attention at a CNN town hall in March, knew on his first trip to South Carolina after that moment -- a late March swing through the state -- that courting black voters would be an issue for him. His events were big, but white, an observation he made to aides at the time.

But Buttigieg's campaign was slow to put a sizable team in the state and, when asked for months about his lack of operation in South Carolina, Buttigieg would often note that his campaign was on the precipice of making an announcement. To date, Buttigieg's campaign has put 40 paid staffers on the ground in South Carolina.

""The voters of South Carolina are still getting to know Pete,"" said Lauren Brown, Buttigieg's South Carolina spokeswoman. ""And what we're observing on the ground is the more they learn about Pete, the more they want to know."" A Buttigieg aide added that 60% of black voters in the recent Quinnipiac poll said they didn't know enough about Buttigieg to have an opinion.

The mayor also faced intense criticism for his handling of racial issues in South Bend . The high point of this criticism happened after a white police officer shot and killed a black South Bend resident who police said was wielding a knife, a crisis that forced the mayor to acknowledge city leaders ""need help"" in diversifying the city's overwhelmingly white police force.

And multiple aides now acknowledge that the campaign was slow to organize campaign events around black engagement, particularly in South Carolina. But they attribute the slowness to Buttigieg's dramatic rise in the Democratic field, which has forced his campaign to scale up rapidly.

MUST WATCH Buttigieg addresses struggle with African-American voters and Buttigieg: 'I feel sorry' for Sen. Blackburn for feeling she needs to smear Lt Col Vindman 06:35

Where the campaign was slow to grow in South Carolina, they were quick and deliberate in Iowa, where Buttigieg has strategically focused on proving viability in what campaign aides believe will be a make or break contest for their campaign.

Even still, despite the growing staff and offices in South Carolina, one Buttigieg aide in the state said the campaign continues to struggle to recruit staffers who are native to the state and understand the local culture.

""There are so many people not from South Carolina,"" one aide said. ""They're coming in like flies to a picnic. They're transferring from other places.""

The aide added that the efforts to engage black voters have increased, but complained that the campaign's top-down, metrics-focused structure can be at odds with the kind of grassroots organizing that is required to reach the state's black voters.

""Just because you have names on a paper and certain numbers of people on paper, it doesn't translate into a vote,"" the aide said.

In South Carolina, voters say Buttigieg will benefit from dramatically increasing the presence in this state.

""I think if he just can get down here, boots on the ground a little more often, he can probably win them over,"" said Rock Hill resident Dewanda Legette.

Efforts to gain black support

Buttigieg, in an effort to beef up his policy offerings aimed at black voters, released the Douglass Plan in July, a multi-pronged proposal that would seek to combat racial inequality by focusing on reforming health care, education, entrepreneurship, criminal justice and voting rights on a federal level.

In August, the campaign brought on Brandon Neal, former Democratic National Committee national political director, as a senior adviser focused on black outreach. Neal immediately went to work to broker meetings -- some public, but many more private -- between Buttigieg and prominent black political figures.

At one event, Buttigieg met with a group of black Democratic women who have called themselves ""the Colored Girls,"" at a dinner that included former DNC chair Donna Brazile, Leah Daughtry, former CEO of the 2008 and 2016 DNC Conventions, longtime Democratic strategist Minyon Moore and Yolanda Caraway, founder of the public relations firm The Caraway Group.

Buttigieg is one of several 2020 presidential candidates who met with the women at a private dinner, which one attendee said went well. The group took a photo with Buttigieg and published it on social media after the event.

Buttigieg speaks during the Black Church Presidential Candidate Conversation series' event in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., on Friday, Aug. 16, 2019.

And in Atlanta, Buttigieg campaigned in a barber shop and beauty shop and participated in an event focused on black women — all without national cameras present — as part of an effort to privately build relationships between the relatively unknown candidate and black community leaders.

But those efforts have not translated into a boost in polls with black voters or an increase in endorsements from black elected officials.

Buttigieg's aides believe they are now at a critical time to move quickly to raise the candidate's profile and standing in the states that come after Iowa and New Hampshire, though they argue that they even with his current non-existent standing, it is not too late.

""If you look at 2007 and 2008 it's wasn't until Barack won Iowa that other voters started to pay attention and say wait a minute,"" Neal said. ""There's always going to be caution, because they want to see how well this person is going to do.""

""You're not going to put all your money on a single horse until you see the horse has viability,"" he added.

It's a case that Buttigieg recently made himself.

""Look, we've got a lot to do in a lot of states,"" the mayor said during a campaign swing through Iowa on Monday, ""but I believe that if Iowa supports me, then that will put us on the trajectory, straight to the nomination and to the White House, and I'm very much hoping that prediction comes true.""

Buttigieg's sexuality and the black vote

Another dynamic that the Buttigieg campaign has had to confront is the role his sexual orientation will play with how more religious, older black voters view his candidacy.

""It's a huge factor for me, being a minister,"" Rev. Jerome Lewis, the 56-year old head of House of Worship Christian Center in Las Vegas, said shortly before offering the opening prayer for a Biden event in West Last Vegas. ""I love him as a person, I just don't stand for his beliefs. I believe what the Bible says in regard to that. ... I just think some of his policies would be just not what my religious beliefs are.""

""I think (it hurts him with black voters),"" Lewis continued. ""I think that is something that makes people of religion to look at that differently. ... It would play a factor.""

Jamal Brown, a Biden spokesman, responded to Lewis by saying Biden ""has spent his career advancing LGBTQ rights"" and that ""He, and our entire campaign, welcome Mayor Pete's historic candidacy and disavow the pastor's views.""

That contention has been hotly disputed by prominent Democrats, including Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosted Buttigieg at a National Action Network event in Atlanta last week.

""There are some homophobic blacks, there are some homophobic whites,"" Sharpton said. ""We don't have an epidemic of homophophia, but we have some homophobics, just like any other community.""

South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn , the dean of the Democratic Party in the state, from South Carolina said earlier this year there is ""no question"" Buttigieg being gay is an issue for older black voters in the state.

""I'm not going to sit here and tell you otherwise, because I think everybody knows that's an issue,"" Clyburn said. ""But I'm saying it's an issue not the way it used to be. My own grandson is very much for him. He is a paid staffer working on the campaign.""

Buttigieg responded to Clyburn by saying he believes people are capable of ""moving past old prejudices.""

Buttigieg more recently has sought to connect with black voters by talking about how he personally connects with the struggle for civil rights because of the fight for LGBTQ rights and his own ""personal struggle"" as a gay man.

At November's debate, during an exchange about his outreach to black voters, Buttigieg said, ""While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here.""

Momentum from Iowa

The view within the campaign is that their ability to build a diverse coalition will only strengthen Buttigieg's standing in Iowa and a strong performance in Iowa similarly helps them break through with voters of color in South Carolina.

In December, the campaign plans to intensify its push to reach black voters, focusing on the issues of addressing poverty and faith, both of which they view as well within Buttigieg's wheelhouse and a key opportunity to connect with black voters -- particularly those who live in the south.

On the agenda is a multi-stop tour of southern cities where Buttigieg plans to engage with black voters and local African American leaders around those issues. To kick off the effort, Buttigieg will attend the church of North Carolina pastor and activist Rev. William Barber and participate in an event focused on addressing poverty with Barber next week.

Aides have dismissed criticism that they lack endorsements from black and Hispanic elected leaders in Washington, noting that Buttigieg is running as a Washington outsider and that while there are two credible African American candidates in the race as well as a former vice president who was Barack Obama's running mate.

""Biden has a 40-year advantage,"" said Neal. ""An advantage over someone who just launched his presidential campaign 12 months ago.""

The campaign has focused much of their efforts on building a roster of black support from South Bend, an acknowledgment that the high profile police shooting of a black man this summer and long-standing tensions between Buttigieg and some local black residents have become part of a narrative that Buttigieg has had historic trouble with black outreach.

Outside advisers have urged Buttigieg to build a base of support from his hometown, arguing that former President Bill Clinton was able to overcome being a relatively unknown national political figure by having a strong base of support from African Americans in Arkansas.

Sensing an opening, and noting Buttigieg's rise in the polls, Biden's campaign blasted out the endorsement of a longtime South Bend city counselor and Buttigieg antagonist Oliver Davis , who also told a reporter that he doubted Buttigieg could beat Trump.

And while there is largely agreement that Buttigieg has time to improve with black voters in South Carolina before the February 29 primary, Jaime Harrison, the former South Carolina Democratic Party chair who is also running for Senate in South Carolina said the state is also a gateway that unlocks a number of other southern Super Tuesday states.

""I would like to see all of them here more -- from Pete and, and Biden and -- Booker and Harris are here a lot,"" Harrison said. ""There is a multiplier effect here in South Carolina that I think people underestimate.""

Correction: This story has been updated to accurately state that the black South Bend resident who was shot and killed by a police offer was wielding a knife, according to police."

Politico’s Ryan Lizza writes:

“Sometimes [Obama] offers candid advice about his visitors’ strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely “too late” for him to secure “money and talent” if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Obama’s remarks about Biden’s issues in Hawkeye State are reflected in his falling poll numbers. “According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is down eight points in Iowa from June to November to leave him tied with Senator Bernie Sanders at 22% as the top choice among registered Iowa Democrats. They were just ahead of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (18%). Other recent polls have shown Biden polling as low as fourth within that top tier, CBS News said.

Obama’s brutal assessment of Biden’s performance on the trail, which has been a constant source of concern for Democratic Party officials and primary voters, is sure to add to the narrative that the former president has little — if any — faith in his former number two’s ability to secure the nomination. Obama infamously did not endorse Biden’s latest White House bid. In a 60 Minutes interview, the former vice president claimed Obama’s silence was at his own request. “I asked him not to,” Biden said. “I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.”

While Lizza acknowledges this public statement, he writes that Biden “wanted a nudge” and was “infuriated” by the former president’s reclusive approach to this political cycle.

News of Obama’s criticisms about Biden comes as the former president has become more vocal about the 2020 primary content.

Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) can defeat President Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

The South Bend mayor has experienced a notable surge in early primary and caucus states in recent days, in Iowa and New Hampshire, particularly. Quinnipiac’s national poll, released Tuesday, indicated that the surge is transcending early voting states.

The survey, taken November 21 – 25, 2019, among 1,355 “self-identified registered voters nationwide,” showed Joe Biden (D) leading the field with 24 percent support and a top tier in flux, with Buttigieg overtaking both Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for second place with 16 percent support. Warren fell two points behind with 14 percent, followed by Sanders with 13 percent support.

The rest of the field is separated by a steep dropoff. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Michael Bloomberg (D) follow ten points behind Sanders with three percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.9 percentage points, putting Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders in a three-way race dead heat for second place:

“Biden is back on top of the pack but now there is a 3-way race for second,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.

“Buttigieg has broken into the top tier, apparently at the expense of Warren, who has taken a dive after being hammered for being too far left on health care and other issues,” he added.

According to the survey, 35 percent of voters say a candidate’s ability to win in a general election matchup is the most important factor a potential nominee can possess. On that front, Biden leads, with 46 percent of Democrat and Democrat-leaning independent voters viewing him as the best bet to defeat President Trump.

The survey also found that Medicare for All, a proposal touted by both Sanders and Warren, is growing “increasingly unpopular among all American voters,” which could explain Buttigieg’s ability to catch up to them in the polls.

According to Quinnipiac, “36 percent say it is a good idea and 52 percent say it is a bad idea.”"

Two of the candidates seem to be the ones whose campaign promises imply Obama didn’t do enough to advance progressivism while in office — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT):

Publicly, he has been clear that he won’t intervene in the primary for or against a candidate, unless he believed there was some egregious attack. “I can’t even imagine with this field how bad it would have to be for him to say something,” said a close adviser. Instead, he sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear. There is one potential exception: Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him. (Asked about that, a spokesperson for Obama pointed out that Obama recently said he would support and campaign for whoever the Democratic nominee is.) If Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don’t think that’s likely. It’s not happening.” (Another close Obama friend said, “Bernie’s not a Democrat.”) As for Warren, the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama, Obama’s relationship with Warren is famously complicated. Back in early 2015, when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives, Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him—a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate. There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren’s campaign.

As for the other candidates, little support can be found from the former president.

“Obama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” one of Obama’s “closest advisers” said in the article.

“They discussed doubts about Kamala Harris’ appeal to African Americans,” the article said.

As for Steve Bullock, Obama spoke for himself: “Nobody knows who you are,” he said.

Obama adviser David Axelrod said, “I mean is Michael Bloomberg really the default candidate for non-college educated white voters?”

“Maybe Amy [Klobuchar], but I honestly don’t think she’s getting out of Iowa,” Axelrod said.

The article tries to paint Obama as a moderate compared to this field of candidates, including Warren and Sanders and their Medicare for All schemes. He is more favorable of former Vice President Joe Biden’s and Buttigieg’s healthcare plans.

But that’s not to say Obama is ready to buy any bumper stickers.

“Another adviser added, ‘I don’t think he was trying to benefit Biden here. Buttigieg benefits from this too. Knowing Obama as well as I do, he doesn’t want to help anyone or hurt anyone, he just wants to win the 2020 election,’” the article said.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is only mentioned once in the article as one of the candidates who has sought advice from Obama.

While six points separate the remainder of the candidates from the top tier, Gabbard finds herself in fifth place with six percent support – two points ahead of Andrew Yang and three points ahead of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). They garnered four percent and three percent, respectively.

The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.4 percent, signaling a statistical tie among the top tier candidates. What is more, 21 percent of respondents indicated that they are “undecided,” and only 43 percent indicated that their “minds were made up”:

According to the Boston Globe, “support for Sanders and Warren was essentially unchanged from the last Suffolk/Globe poll in August,” but Biden “lost 9 percentage points, while Buttigieg gained 7 points.”

The poll reflects the increased skepticism of Biden’s viability among Democrat voters.

“I had pretty high hopes for Joe Biden. I wanted to like him and vote for him because of his time with the Obama administration and I thought he had the experience,” one voter, Michael Mahany, 61, told the Boston Globe.

“But he just hasn’t had his stuff together, and he just hasn’t stepped up in the debates and I am not sure he ever will now,” he added.

The poll also found that Gabbard is appealing to moderate voters in the Granite State:

The survey found Gabbard does better among men and moderates. And far more than any other candidate, her supporters said that if Gabbard doesn’t become the nominee, they will consider voting for Trump or for a third-party candidate: “I liked Tulsi more after Clinton attacked her,” said Mark Gold, a 58-year-old computer consultant who lives in Concord. “The Democratic Party appears to like to manipulate things for their preferred candidate and I think that demonstrated she is different.”

“The narrative is changing in New Hampshire,” Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said, noting the ongoing battle between the New England senators.

“Now, add to that the war between Buttigieg and Biden,” he added."

YouGov Blue Vice President Alissa Stollwerk told Out:

Seventy-seven percent of LGBTQ+ Democratic primary voters identified in our survey as very or somewhat liberal, approximately 20 percentage points higher than the percentage of Democratic primary voters overall who identify as very or somewhat liberal in our surveys.

Out attributes Warren’s popularity among the LGBT community to her prioritization of LGBT issues – something she has incorporated into the bulk of her plans. For instance, she emphasized LGBT protections as part of her criminal justice reform plan and has called for “high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care.” She also floated mixed prisons as part of her “LGBTQ+ Rights and Equality” plan.

Stollwerk continued:

Any survey is a snapshot of a group of people at a given time. However, as far as we know, this is the first survey of likely Democratic primary voters who identify as LGBTQ+, and it hopefully will help people understand the viewpoints of these Democratic voters, what issues are important to them, and what they want to see in the next Democratic nominee for president.

More per Out:

The results themselves show the relationship between Warren and LGBTQ+ voters likely goes deeper than partisanship. She had the highest favorable ratings among candidates by a 10-point margin, with 54 percent viewing her highly favorably. Meanwhile, survey respondents also felt she had the best chance to beat President Donald Trump in a general election: 53 percent felt she could do so, followed by Biden (52 percent), Sanders (46 percent), and Buttigieg (29 percent). But if the survey is good news for the Warren campaign, the results should be a cause for concern in the Biden camp. His unfavorables among LGBTQ+ voters were disproportionately high: 33 percent of respondents viewed him highly or somewhat unfavorably, a greater percentage than every other candidate except for Gabbard and Williamson. They both netted 38 percent unfavorable ratings.

According to Politico, Obama warned Patrick this year that it was “too late” for him to run, citing the “money and talent” needed to proceed with a successful campaign.

As Politico reported:

Sometimes he offers candid advice about his visitors’ strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely “too late” for him to secure “money and talent” if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting.

Patrick is not the only Democrat hopeful who Obama has discouraged. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, a “close friend” to Obama, was reportedly “frustrated” by the former president refraining from encouraging his presidential aspirations.

”He’s still pretty sensitive about it,” a source close to Holder told Politico. “He was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run. Holder couldn’t get in because Biden and Holder have the same set of people.”

“Once Biden was getting in then Eric couldn’t get in. So that frustrated Holder. It blocked him,” the source added. “And Biden has turned out the way they all feared, and that’s really frustrating to Eric.”

While Obama has signaled he will not endorse a Democrat primary candidate and has yet to issue a stark criticism to any one candidate by name, he has taken veiled shots at some of the more “radical candidates” among leftist donors.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,” Obama told a group of left-wing donors in Washington, DC, this month.

“The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,” he continued.

“I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that’s going to activate them,” he added.

According to Politico, Obama has also been “skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” unsure of Sen. Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) appeal among black voters, and privately said that a Warren nomination would be a “repudiation” of him when she considered running in 2015.

Despite his purported uneasiness over some of the candidates, Obama “sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear,” according to Politico."

""The thing that I admire about him is that he's done it not by over promising things and pandering to the base and he doesn't use divisive rhetoric or my way or the highway approach,"" Rice said, in a thinly veiled swipe at Buttigieg's more progressive competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. ""He's really demonstrated an unmatched ability and a willingness to reach voters where they are from across the political spectrum.""

Rice told CNN's Bianna Golodryga on ""CNN Right Now"" Buttigieg ""gives a message that resonates with everyone across this country.""

After jumping to a commanding position … [+14046 chars]",Pete Buttigieg has a problem.,2019-11-26,CNN,Pete Buttigieg confronts his existential problem: Courting black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/pete-buttigieg-black-voters/index.html,"After jumping to a commanding position in Iowa and improving his chances in New Hampshire, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is confronting the real possibility that his inability to win over black voters will thwart his rise and, in the worst-case scenario for Buttigieg, sink his campaign.

Buttigieg has said for months that he needs ""help"" courting black voters and ""has a lot of work to continue to do"" in that effort. He has blamed his lack of support with African Americans on his lack of long-standing relationships that other presidential hopefuls, particularly former Vice President Joe Biden , have fostered for years.

But months removed from those first admissions, Buttigieg's standing with black voters remains unchanged. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found him at 0% with black voters in South Carolina, and even some of his more devout supporters are starting to worry whether he can overcome this deficiency. Buttigieg also lags majorly behind his top competitors in endorsements from black elected officials.

Black voters are critical to the Democratic Party, especially in South Carolina, where they will be a large and influential voting bloc in the party's electorate. But Buttigieg's inability to win black support will also hamper him in Nevada -- a state that is over 10% black and the third contest in the nominating process -- and a host of so-called Super Tuesday states like Alabama, Virginia and North Carolina, all places with large black populations that will vote on March 3.

These issues for Buttigieg were clear on a warm, late October afternoon when Buttigieg attracted what his campaign said was the largest crowd that any 2020 Democratic campaign has gathered in the state of South Carolina.

The rally was hosted in Rock Hill, a growing city that is 40% black. But you wouldn't be able to tell that from the largely white crowd that had gathered to see the South Bend mayor.

Nikita Jackson, who sits on the Rock Hill city council and introduced Buttigieg at the rally, says that event highlights that a campaign that wants to reach black has voters to go to them, not wait for black voters to come out to political events. She has urged the campaign to show up at local events rather than creating events and asking African American residents to come out, advice she says the campaign has taken.

""For working people, you cannot ask them to go outside of their norm,"" Jackson said. ""Because going outside of their norm can create chaos in their household.""

Despite her rousing introduction of Buttigieg at his rally, Jackson says she has not endorsed in the 2020 presidential race. Asked if Buttigieg is able to connect with black voters in the state, Jackson paused for several seconds.

""You can clearly see there wasn't a connection there because there wasn't a lot of African Americans there,"" Jackson finally answered. ""His campaign is doing all that they can to try to connect with the minority vote.""

Campaign slow to deploy staff to South Carolina

Buttigieg addresses the crowd at the 2019 South Carolina Democratic Party State Convention on June 22, 2019 in Columbia, South Carolina.

Buttigieg, who first gained national attention at a CNN town hall in March, knew on his first trip to South Carolina after that moment -- a late March swing through the state -- that courting black voters would be an issue for him. His events were big, but white, an observation he made to aides at the time.

But Buttigieg's campaign was slow to put a sizable team in the state and, when asked for months about his lack of operation in South Carolina, Buttigieg would often note that his campaign was on the precipice of making an announcement. To date, Buttigieg's campaign has put 40 paid staffers on the ground in South Carolina.

""The voters of South Carolina are still getting to know Pete,"" said Lauren Brown, Buttigieg's South Carolina spokeswoman. ""And what we're observing on the ground is the more they learn about Pete, the more they want to know."" A Buttigieg aide added that 60% of black voters in the recent Quinnipiac poll said they didn't know enough about Buttigieg to have an opinion.

The mayor also faced intense criticism for his handling of racial issues in South Bend . The high point of this criticism happened after a white police officer shot and killed a black South Bend resident who police said was wielding a knife, a crisis that forced the mayor to acknowledge city leaders ""need help"" in diversifying the city's overwhelmingly white police force.

And multiple aides now acknowledge that the campaign was slow to organize campaign events around black engagement, particularly in South Carolina. But they attribute the slowness to Buttigieg's dramatic rise in the Democratic field, which has forced his campaign to scale up rapidly.

MUST WATCH Buttigieg addresses struggle with African-American voters and Buttigieg: 'I feel sorry' for Sen. Blackburn for feeling she needs to smear Lt Col Vindman 06:35

Where the campaign was slow to grow in South Carolina, they were quick and deliberate in Iowa, where Buttigieg has strategically focused on proving viability in what campaign aides believe will be a make or break contest for their campaign.

Even still, despite the growing staff and offices in South Carolina, one Buttigieg aide in the state said the campaign continues to struggle to recruit staffers who are native to the state and understand the local culture.

""There are so many people not from South Carolina,"" one aide said. ""They're coming in like flies to a picnic. They're transferring from other places.""

The aide added that the efforts to engage black voters have increased, but complained that the campaign's top-down, metrics-focused structure can be at odds with the kind of grassroots organizing that is required to reach the state's black voters.

""Just because you have names on a paper and certain numbers of people on paper, it doesn't translate into a vote,"" the aide said.

In South Carolina, voters say Buttigieg will benefit from dramatically increasing the presence in this state.

""I think if he just can get down here, boots on the ground a little more often, he can probably win them over,"" said Rock Hill resident Dewanda Legette.

Efforts to gain black support

Buttigieg, in an effort to beef up his policy offerings aimed at black voters, released the Douglass Plan in July, a multi-pronged proposal that would seek to combat racial inequality by focusing on reforming health care, education, entrepreneurship, criminal justice and voting rights on a federal level.

In August, the campaign brought on Brandon Neal, former Democratic National Committee national political director, as a senior adviser focused on black outreach. Neal immediately went to work to broker meetings -- some public, but many more private -- between Buttigieg and prominent black political figures.

At one event, Buttigieg met with a group of black Democratic women who have called themselves ""the Colored Girls,"" at a dinner that included former DNC chair Donna Brazile, Leah Daughtry, former CEO of the 2008 and 2016 DNC Conventions, longtime Democratic strategist Minyon Moore and Yolanda Caraway, founder of the public relations firm The Caraway Group.

Buttigieg is one of several 2020 presidential candidates who met with the women at a private dinner, which one attendee said went well. The group took a photo with Buttigieg and published it on social media after the event.

Buttigieg speaks during the Black Church Presidential Candidate Conversation series' event in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., on Friday, Aug. 16, 2019.

And in Atlanta, Buttigieg campaigned in a barber shop and beauty shop and participated in an event focused on black women — all without national cameras present — as part of an effort to privately build relationships between the relatively unknown candidate and black community leaders.

But those efforts have not translated into a boost in polls with black voters or an increase in endorsements from black elected officials.

Buttigieg's aides believe they are now at a critical time to move quickly to raise the candidate's profile and standing in the states that come after Iowa and New Hampshire, though they argue that they even with his current non-existent standing, it is not too late.

""If you look at 2007 and 2008 it's wasn't until Barack won Iowa that other voters started to pay attention and say wait a minute,"" Neal said. ""There's always going to be caution, because they want to see how well this person is going to do.""

""You're not going to put all your money on a single horse until you see the horse has viability,"" he added.

It's a case that Buttigieg recently made himself.

""Look, we've got a lot to do in a lot of states,"" the mayor said during a campaign swing through Iowa on Monday, ""but I believe that if Iowa supports me, then that will put us on the trajectory, straight to the nomination and to the White House, and I'm very much hoping that prediction comes true.""

Buttigieg's sexuality and the black vote

Another dynamic that the Buttigieg campaign has had to confront is the role his sexual orientation will play with how more religious, older black voters view his candidacy.

""It's a huge factor for me, being a minister,"" Rev. Jerome Lewis, the 56-year old head of House of Worship Christian Center in Las Vegas, said shortly before offering the opening prayer for a Biden event in West Last Vegas. ""I love him as a person, I just don't stand for his beliefs. I believe what the Bible says in regard to that. ... I just think some of his policies would be just not what my religious beliefs are.""

""I think (it hurts him with black voters),"" Lewis continued. ""I think that is something that makes people of religion to look at that differently. ... It would play a factor.""

Jamal Brown, a Biden spokesman, responded to Lewis by saying Biden ""has spent his career advancing LGBTQ rights"" and that ""He, and our entire campaign, welcome Mayor Pete's historic candidacy and disavow the pastor's views.""

That contention has been hotly disputed by prominent Democrats, including Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosted Buttigieg at a National Action Network event in Atlanta last week.

""There are some homophobic blacks, there are some homophobic whites,"" Sharpton said. ""We don't have an epidemic of homophophia, but we have some homophobics, just like any other community.""

South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn , the dean of the Democratic Party in the state, from South Carolina said earlier this year there is ""no question"" Buttigieg being gay is an issue for older black voters in the state.

""I'm not going to sit here and tell you otherwise, because I think everybody knows that's an issue,"" Clyburn said. ""But I'm saying it's an issue not the way it used to be. My own grandson is very much for him. He is a paid staffer working on the campaign.""

Buttigieg responded to Clyburn by saying he believes people are capable of ""moving past old prejudices.""

Buttigieg more recently has sought to connect with black voters by talking about how he personally connects with the struggle for civil rights because of the fight for LGBTQ rights and his own ""personal struggle"" as a gay man.

At November's debate, during an exchange about his outreach to black voters, Buttigieg said, ""While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here.""

Momentum from Iowa

The view within the campaign is that their ability to build a diverse coalition will only strengthen Buttigieg's standing in Iowa and a strong performance in Iowa similarly helps them break through with voters of color in South Carolina.

In December, the campaign plans to intensify its push to reach black voters, focusing on the issues of addressing poverty and faith, both of which they view as well within Buttigieg's wheelhouse and a key opportunity to connect with black voters -- particularly those who live in the south.

On the agenda is a multi-stop tour of southern cities where Buttigieg plans to engage with black voters and local African American leaders around those issues. To kick off the effort, Buttigieg will attend the church of North Carolina pastor and activist Rev. William Barber and participate in an event focused on addressing poverty with Barber next week.

Aides have dismissed criticism that they lack endorsements from black and Hispanic elected leaders in Washington, noting that Buttigieg is running as a Washington outsider and that while there are two credible African American candidates in the race as well as a former vice president who was Barack Obama's running mate.

""Biden has a 40-year advantage,"" said Neal. ""An advantage over someone who just launched his presidential campaign 12 months ago.""

The campaign has focused much of their efforts on building a roster of black support from South Bend, an acknowledgment that the high profile police shooting of a black man this summer and long-standing tensions between Buttigieg and some local black residents have become part of a narrative that Buttigieg has had historic trouble with black outreach.

Outside advisers have urged Buttigieg to build a base of support from his hometown, arguing that former President Bill Clinton was able to overcome being a relatively unknown national political figure by having a strong base of support from African Americans in Arkansas.

Sensing an opening, and noting Buttigieg's rise in the polls, Biden's campaign blasted out the endorsement of a longtime South Bend city counselor and Buttigieg antagonist Oliver Davis , who also told a reporter that he doubted Buttigieg could beat Trump.

And while there is largely agreement that Buttigieg has time to improve with black voters in South Carolina before the February 29 primary, Jaime Harrison, the former South Carolina Democratic Party chair who is also running for Senate in South Carolina said the state is also a gateway that unlocks a number of other southern Super Tuesday states.

""I would like to see all of them here more -- from Pete and, and Biden and -- Booker and Harris are here a lot,"" Harrison said. ""There is a multiplier effect here in South Carolina that I think people underestimate.""

Correction: This story has been updated to accurately state that the black South Bend resident who was shot and killed by a police offer was wielding a knife, according to police."

No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate . A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.

The findings suggest slight declines in support for Biden and Warren since October, and a modest increase in backing for Buttigieg. Sanders' support remains about the same as it was in October.

A majority of potential Democratic voters remain uncertain about their choices. Just 42% say they have definitely decided on their candidates, about the same as in October, and Biden continues to have an edge among that group of committed voters.

Asked who they would choose if the race came down to the top four instead of the 18 major candidates currently in the running, the order at the top remains the same. Biden continues to hold a lead -- 35% say they would choose him -- with 23% choosing Sanders, 20% Warren and 17% Buttigieg.

Buttigieg's bump in the poll coincides with a well-received debate performance , with 22% who watched or followed news coverage about last week's debate saying he had the best night. Biden lands in second at 16%, Sanders at 10%, Harris and Warren each at 8% and Booker at 5%.

Most potential Democratic voters say they prefer a candidate who aims for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if they wouldn't make major changes, over a candidate who aims for policies that would make larger changes (56% feel that way, 36% prefer a candidate who shoots for major change). But when asked which candidate would best handle specific issues, potential Democratic voters are more closely divided between those seeking big changes and those aiming for more incremental progress.

On health care, 28% say Sanders -- an advocate of ""Medicare for All"" and the elimination of private health insurance -- would best handle the issue. That's about even with the 26% who choose Biden, who has argued against moving to a completely government-run system. Another 19% say they prefer Warren's approach, which ultimately results in government health coverage for all, while 7% choose Buttigieg, and no other candidate has the backing of more than 3% on the issue.

Sanders leads the way more clearly on handling the climate crisis: 27% favor his approach, followed by 21% who prefer Biden and 15% Warren.

Biden holds an edge on the economy, though by a narrower margin than he did in October. About 3 in 10 (29%) prefer him on the issue, down from 38% last month, with Warren at 19% and Sanders at 17%. Buttigieg lands at 7% and Yang at 5% on the issue.

Biden has lost some ground as most trusted on almost all the issues tested, while Buttigieg has made gains nearly across the board.

More potential Democratic voters see Biden as capable of managing the government effectively (86%) than say the same about Sanders (73%), Warren (73%) or Buttigieg (54%). Biden also tops the leading candidates on being able to unite the country rather than divide it (73% say so, vs. 65% for Sanders, 58% for Warren and 54% for Buttigieg).

Sanders (66%), Biden (64%) and Warren (61%) are all closely clustered on being able to bring needed change, with Buttigieg a bit behind at 54%.

Warren holds a clear advantage on having the stamina and sharpness to be president -- 81% say that describes her, compared with 66% for Buttigieg, 65% for Biden and 58% for Sanders.

Sanders' strength is being seen as honest and trustworthy. Nearly 9 in 10 potential Democratic voters (89%) call Sanders honest and trustworthy, vs. 78% for Warren, 75% for Biden and 64% for Buttigieg. That carries through among all adults as well. Overall, 62% see Sanders as honest and trustworthy, making him the only candidate of the top four Democrats plus President Donald Trump who is seen that way by a majority of Americans.

All four tested Democratic candidates outpace Trump on two measures: honesty (62% Sanders, 49% Warren, 47% Biden, 45% Buttigieg, 36% Trump) and uniting the country rather than dividing it (47% Biden, 44% Sanders, 37% Warren, 35% Buttigieg, 31% Trump).

Trump ties Sanders at the top on being able to bring needed change (43% each, followed by Biden at 40%, Warren at 39%, Buttigieg at 35%). Biden leads the field on managing the government effectively (55% Biden, 46% Sanders, 44% Warren, 42% Trump, 36% Buttigieg). While Warren takes the lead on having the stamina and sharpness for the presidency (54% describe Warren that way, 47% Trump, 46% Buttigieg, 44% Biden and 40% Sanders).

One caveat on these figures: A large number (roughly a quarter across attributes) say they are unsure how to answer about Buttigieg. For the other candidates, that number was in the single digits across the board.

Health care (46% extremely important) and gun policy (44% extremely important) continue to rank at the top of voters' issue concerns for 2020. The impeachment inquiry into Trump ranks near the bottom, with 27% calling that extremely important. That rises a bit to 39% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, but dips to just 15% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters."

Follow here for live analysis.,2019-11-27,CNN,CNN's latest poll on 2020 Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-poll-11-27-2019/index.html,"Democratic primary voters desperately want to beat Trump. In poll after poll (including this one), they list beating Trump as a bigger priority for their primary than a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.

Figuring out which Democrat is the most electable is no easy task, however.

One thought I had was to see what quality is best correlated with Trump’s approval rating and then see which Democrats scored best on it. The problem is that there are two variables (being able to bring about change the country needs and can manage government effectively) that are highly correlated, and they give us very different answers on potential electability.

Biden is the only Democrat who a majority of voters (55%) say can manage the government effectively. All the other Democrats have a similar net score (those who say they can minus those who say they can't) to one another.

Yet, Biden has the worst spread on being a change agent (40% say yes compared to 55% who say no). Buttigieg and Sanders have the best net scores at -6 points and -7 points, respectively.

This, of course, is the fundamental issue Democratic primary voters face in 2020. If this is a change election, then Biden is likely not going to be the most electable candidate. If, however, voters end up wanting someone they think can right the ship from an unorthodox Trump presidency, Biden’s the right guy."

Politico’s Ryan Lizza writes:

“Sometimes [Obama] offers candid advice about his visitors’ strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely “too late” for him to secure “money and talent” if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Obama’s remarks about Biden’s issues in Hawkeye State are reflected in his falling poll numbers. “According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is down eight points in Iowa from June to November to leave him tied with Senator Bernie Sanders at 22% as the top choice among registered Iowa Democrats. They were just ahead of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (18%). Other recent polls have shown Biden polling as low as fourth within that top tier, CBS News said.

Obama’s brutal assessment of Biden’s performance on the trail, which has been a constant source of concern for Democratic Party officials and primary voters, is sure to add to the narrative that the former president has little — if any — faith in his former number two’s ability to secure the nomination. Obama infamously did not endorse Biden’s latest White House bid. In a 60 Minutes interview, the former vice president claimed Obama’s silence was at his own request. “I asked him not to,” Biden said. “I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.”

While Lizza acknowledges this public statement, he writes that Biden “wanted a nudge” and was “infuriated” by the former president’s reclusive approach to this political cycle.

News of Obama’s criticisms about Biden comes as the former president has become more vocal about the 2020 primary content.

Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting “purity tests” in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee.

Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California.

Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) can defeat President Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc.

“We will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,” Obama said. “Which is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.”

Obama urged Democrats to “chill out,” saying, “The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide” better health care and education and address climate change.

The survey, taken November 21 – 25, 2019, among 1,355 “self-identified registered voters nationwide,” showed Joe Biden (D) leading the field with 24 percent support and a top tier in flux, with Buttigieg overtaking both Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for second place with 16 percent support. Warren fell two points behind with 14 percent, followed by Sanders with 13 percent support.

The rest of the field is separated by a steep dropoff. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Michael Bloomberg (D) follow ten points behind Sanders with three percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

“Biden is back on top of the pack but now there is a 3-way race for second,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.

“Buttigieg has broken into the top tier, apparently at the expense of Warren, who has taken a dive after being hammered for being too far left on health care and other issues,” he added.

According to the survey, 35 percent of voters say a candidate’s ability to win in a general election matchup is the most important factor a potential nominee can possess. On that front, Biden leads, with 46 percent of Democrat and Democrat-leaning independent voters viewing him as the best bet to defeat President Trump.

The survey also found that Medicare for All, a proposal touted by both Sanders and Warren, is growing “increasingly unpopular among all American voters,” which could explain Buttigieg’s ability to catch up to them in the polls.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) dominating the field, a WHDH 7 News/Emerson College poll released on the eve of Thanksgiving revealed.

Recent polls have indicated Sanders’ health scare did not have a negative impact on his standing in the Democrat field. In fact, he has experienced a notable boost since undergoing the emergency heart procedure, both nationally and in key early primary and caucus states.

The Emerson poll, taken November 22-26, 2019, among 549 Democrat primary voters in New Hampshire, showed Sanders taking the lead with 26 percent support. It also indicated Buttigieg on the rise, coming in second place with 22 percent support.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) fell eight points behind the South Bend mayor with 14 percent support each.

According to the survey, Buttigieg fares best among independent voters, earning 29 support. Sanders, Warren, and Biden follow with 21 percent, 12 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

The poll also revealed a major shakeup in the lower tier of candidates, with Rep. Tusi Gabbard (D-HI) and Andrew Yang overtaking Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth and sixth place. They received six percent support, five percent support, and four percent support, respectively. Tom Steyer (D) came in eighth place with three percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:

Emerson notes the results reflect a “major shift” from the New Hampshire poll taken in September, “where Biden led with 24% (-10), followed by Warren with 21% (-7).

“Sanders has jumped from third, where he was at 13% (+13), and Buttigieg also doubled his support from 11% (+11),” Emerson noted.

Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said:

The Democratic voters have taken a look at Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren and they appear unsatisfied at this time which brought some voters back to Bernie Sanders while others are now moving to a fresh face in Pete Buttigieg, this demonstrates the fluidity of the race.

The results coincide with a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released this week, which also showed Sanders retaking the lead in the Granite State. The survey also indicated a surge for Buttigieg, battling Warren for second place 13 percent to her 14 percent. Biden came closely behind with 12 percent support:

Two of the candidates seem to be the ones whose campaign promises imply Obama didn’t do enough to advance progressivism while in office — Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT):

Publicly, he has been clear that he won’t intervene in the primary for or against a candidate, unless he believed there was some egregious attack. “I can’t even imagine with this field how bad it would have to be for him to say something,” said a close adviser. Instead, he sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear. There is one potential exception: Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him. (Asked about that, a spokesperson for Obama pointed out that Obama recently said he would support and campaign for whoever the Democratic nominee is.) If Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don’t think that’s likely. It’s not happening.” (Another close Obama friend said, “Bernie’s not a Democrat.”) As for Warren, the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama, Obama’s relationship with Warren is famously complicated. Back in early 2015, when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives, Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him—a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate. There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren’s campaign.

As for the other candidates, little support can be found from the former president.

“Obama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” one of Obama’s “closest advisers” said in the article.

“They discussed doubts about Kamala Harris’ appeal to African Americans,” the article said.

As for Steve Bullock, Obama spoke for himself: “Nobody knows who you are,” he said.

Obama adviser David Axelrod said, “I mean is Michael Bloomberg really the default candidate for non-college educated white voters?”

“Maybe Amy [Klobuchar], but I honestly don’t think she’s getting out of Iowa,” Axelrod said.

The article tries to paint Obama as a moderate compared to this field of candidates, including Warren and Sanders and their Medicare for All schemes. He is more favorable of former Vice President Joe Biden’s and Buttigieg’s healthcare plans.

But that’s not to say Obama is ready to buy any bumper stickers.

“Another adviser added, ‘I don’t think he was trying to benefit Biden here. Buttigieg benefits from this too. Knowing Obama as well as I do, he doesn’t want to help anyone or hurt anyone, he just wants to win the 2020 election,’” the article said.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is only mentioned once in the article as one of the candidates who has sought advice from Obama.

Morning Consult’s post-debate poll, taken November 21-24, 2019, among 8,102 registered voters likely to participate in their state’s Democrat primary or caucus, showed Sanders surpassing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for second place with 21 percent support to her 15 percent.

The survey showed former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leading, a consistent trend in this particular national poll, with 30 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth place with nine percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support and Andrew Yang (D) closely behind with four percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error of +/-1 percent:

The Morning Consult poll also showed Sanders maintaining his second-place status in early primary and caucus states. The poll surveyed 372 voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, and found Biden leading with 26 percent support – four percent less than his national lead. Sanders came right behind with 23 percent support, followed by Warren, Tom Steyer (D), Buttigieg, and Yang with 18 percent, nine percent, eight percent, and four percent, respectively.

The poll, taken from November 21-24, 2019, among 500 likely New Hampshire Democrat primary voters, found Sanders retaking the lead in his neighboring state with 16 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 14 percent, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D) closely behind with 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

While six points separate the remainder of the candidates from the top tier, Gabbard finds herself in fifth place with six percent support – two points ahead of Andrew Yang and three points ahead of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). They garnered four percent and three percent, respectively.

The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.4 percent, signaling a statistical tie among the top tier candidates. What is more, 21 percent of respondents indicated that they are “undecided,” and only 43 percent indicated that their “minds were made up”:

According to the Boston Globe, “support for Sanders and Warren was essentially unchanged from the last Suffolk/Globe poll in August,” but Biden “lost 9 percentage points, while Buttigieg gained 7 points.”

The poll reflects the increased skepticism of Biden’s viability among Democrat voters.

“I had pretty high hopes for Joe Biden. I wanted to like him and vote for him because of his time with the Obama administration and I thought he had the experience,” one voter, Michael Mahany, 61, told the Boston Globe.

“But he just hasn’t had his stuff together, and he just hasn’t stepped up in the debates and I am not sure he ever will now,” he added.

The poll also found that Gabbard is appealing to moderate voters in the Granite State:

The survey found Gabbard does better among men and moderates. And far more than any other candidate, her supporters said that if Gabbard doesn’t become the nominee, they will consider voting for Trump or for a third-party candidate: “I liked Tulsi more after Clinton attacked her,” said Mark Gold, a 58-year-old computer consultant who lives in Concord. “The Democratic Party appears to like to manipulate things for their preferred candidate and I think that demonstrated she is different.”

“The narrative is changing in New Hampshire,” Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said, noting the ongoing battle between the New England senators.

“Now, add to that the war between Buttigieg and Biden,” he added."

YouGov Blue Vice President Alissa Stollwerk told Out:

Seventy-seven percent of LGBTQ+ Democratic primary voters identified in our survey as very or somewhat liberal, approximately 20 percentage points higher than the percentage of Democratic primary voters overall who identify as very or somewhat liberal in our surveys.

Out attributes Warren’s popularity among the LGBT community to her prioritization of LGBT issues – something she has incorporated into the bulk of her plans. For instance, she emphasized LGBT protections as part of her criminal justice reform plan and has called for “high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care.” She also floated mixed prisons as part of her “LGBTQ+ Rights and Equality” plan.

Stollwerk continued:

Any survey is a snapshot of a group of people at a given time. However, as far as we know, this is the first survey of likely Democratic primary voters who identify as LGBTQ+, and it hopefully will help people understand the viewpoints of these Democratic voters, what issues are important to them, and what they want to see in the next Democratic nominee for president.

More per Out:

The results themselves show the relationship between Warren and LGBTQ+ voters likely goes deeper than partisanship. She had the highest favorable ratings among candidates by a 10-point margin, with 54 percent viewing her highly favorably. Meanwhile, survey respondents also felt she had the best chance to beat President Donald Trump in a general election: 53 percent felt she could do so, followed by Biden (52 percent), Sanders (46 percent), and Buttigieg (29 percent). But if the survey is good news for the Warren campaign, the results should be a cause for concern in the Biden camp. His unfavorables among LGBTQ+ voters were disproportionately high: 33 percent of respondents viewed him highly or somewhat unfavorably, a greater percentage than every other candidate except for Gabbard and Williamson. They both netted 38 percent unfavorable ratings.

Warren has been very vocal in her support for the LGBT community on the campaign trail, even thanking drag queen Shea Couleé for “representing” Team Warren at RuPaul’s DragCon in September."

“In a spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American Dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for President of the United States,” Patrick, who reportedly called Obama prior to his announcement, said in a video:

According to Politico, Obama warned Patrick this year that it was “too late” for him to run, citing the “money and talent” needed to proceed with a successful campaign.

As Politico reported:

Sometimes he offers candid advice about his visitors’ strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely “too late” for him to secure “money and talent” if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Patrick has yet to gain traction following his announcement. He opted to cancel an event at Morehouse College at the last minute last week after only two people showed up:

Patrick is not the only Democrat hopeful who Obama has discouraged. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, a “close friend” to Obama, was reportedly “frustrated” by the former president refraining from encouraging his presidential aspirations.

”He’s still pretty sensitive about it,” a source close to Holder told Politico. “He was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run. Holder couldn’t get in because Biden and Holder have the same set of people.”

“Once Biden was getting in then Eric couldn’t get in. So that frustrated Holder. It blocked him,” the source added. “And Biden has turned out the way they all feared, and that’s really frustrating to Eric.”

While Obama has signaled he will not endorse a Democrat primary candidate and has yet to issue a stark criticism to any one candidate by name, he has taken veiled shots at some of the more “radical candidates” among leftist donors.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,” Obama told a group of left-wing donors in Washington, DC, this month.

“The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,” he continued.

“I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that’s going to activate them,” he added.

According to Politico, Obama has also been “skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” unsure of Sen. Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) appeal among black voters, and privately said that a Warren nomination would be a “repudiation” of him when she considered running in 2015.

Despite his purported uneasiness over some of the candidates, Obama “sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear,” according to Politico."

No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate . A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.

The findings suggest slight declines in support for Biden and Warren since October, and a modest increase in backing for Buttigieg. Sanders' support remains about the same as it was in October.

A majority of potential Democratic voters remain uncertain about their choices. Just 42% say they have definitely decided on their candidates, about the same as in October, and Biden continues to have an edge among that group of committed voters.

Asked who they would choose if the race came down to the top four instead of the 18 major candidates currently in the running, the order at the top remains the same. Biden continues to hold a lead -- 35% say they would choose him -- with 23% choosing Sanders, 20% Warren and 17% Buttigieg.

Buttigieg's bump in the poll coincides with a well-received debate performance , with 22% who watched or followed news coverage about last week's debate saying he had the best night. Biden lands in second at 16%, Sanders at 10%, Harris and Warren each at 8% and Booker at 5%.

Most potential Democratic voters say they prefer a candidate who aims for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if they wouldn't make major changes, over a candidate who aims for policies that would make larger changes (56% feel that way, 36% prefer a candidate who shoots for major change). But when asked which candidate would best handle specific issues, potential Democratic voters are more closely divided between those seeking big changes and those aiming for more incremental progress.

On health care, 28% say Sanders -- an advocate of ""Medicare for All"" and the elimination of private health insurance -- would best handle the issue. That's about even with the 26% who choose Biden, who has argued against moving to a completely government-run system. Another 19% say they prefer Warren's approach, which ultimately results in government health coverage for all, while 7% choose Buttigieg, and no other candidate has the backing of more than 3% on the issue.

Sanders leads the way more clearly on handling the climate crisis: 27% favor his approach, followed by 21% who prefer Biden and 15% Warren.

Biden holds an edge on the economy, though by a narrower margin than he did in October. About 3 in 10 (29%) prefer him on the issue, down from 38% last month, with Warren at 19% and Sanders at 17%. Buttigieg lands at 7% and Yang at 5% on the issue.

Biden has lost some ground as most trusted on almost all the issues tested, while Buttigieg has made gains nearly across the board.

More potential Democratic voters see Biden as capable of managing the government effectively (86%) than say the same about Sanders (73%), Warren (73%) or Buttigieg (54%). Biden also tops the leading candidates on being able to unite the country rather than divide it (73% say so, vs. 65% for Sanders, 58% for Warren and 54% for Buttigieg).

Sanders (66%), Biden (64%) and Warren (61%) are all closely clustered on being able to bring needed change, with Buttigieg a bit behind at 54%.

Warren holds a clear advantage on having the stamina and sharpness to be president -- 81% say that describes her, compared with 66% for Buttigieg, 65% for Biden and 58% for Sanders.

Sanders' strength is being seen as honest and trustworthy. Nearly 9 in 10 potential Democratic voters (89%) call Sanders honest and trustworthy, vs. 78% for Warren, 75% for Biden and 64% for Buttigieg. That carries through among all adults as well. Overall, 62% see Sanders as honest and trustworthy, making him the only candidate of the top four Democrats plus President Donald Trump who is seen that way by a majority of Americans.

All four tested Democratic candidates outpace Trump on two measures: honesty (62% Sanders, 49% Warren, 47% Biden, 45% Buttigieg, 36% Trump) and uniting the country rather than dividing it (47% Biden, 44% Sanders, 37% Warren, 35% Buttigieg, 31% Trump).

Trump ties Sanders at the top on being able to bring needed change (43% each, followed by Biden at 40%, Warren at 39%, Buttigieg at 35%). Biden leads the field on managing the government effectively (55% Biden, 46% Sanders, 44% Warren, 42% Trump, 36% Buttigieg). While Warren takes the lead on having the stamina and sharpness for the presidency (54% describe Warren that way, 47% Trump, 46% Buttigieg, 44% Biden and 40% Sanders).

One caveat on these figures: A large number (roughly a quarter across attributes) say they are unsure how to answer about Buttigieg. For the other candidates, that number was in the single digits across the board.

Health care (46% extremely important) and gun policy (44% extremely important) continue to rank at the top of voters' issue concerns for 2020. The impeachment inquiry into Trump ranks near the bottom, with 27% calling that extremely important. That rises a bit to 39% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, but dips to just 15% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters."

In poll after poll (including this one), they list beating Trump as a bigger priority for their primary than a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.

Figuring out which Democrat is the most electable is no easy task, however.

One thought I had was to see what quality is best correlated with Trump’s approval rating and then see which Democrats scored best on it. The problem is that there are two variables (being able to bring about change the country needs and can manage government effectively) that are highly correlated, and they give us very different answers on potential electability.

Biden is the only Democrat who a majority of voters (55%) say can manage the government effectively. All the other Democrats have a similar net score (those who say they can minus those who say they can't) to one another.

Yet, Biden has the worst spread on being a change agent (40% say yes compared to 55% who say no). Buttigieg and Sanders have the best net scores at -6 points and -7 points, respectively.

This, of course, is the fundamental issue Democratic primary voters face in 2020. If this is a change election, then Biden is likely not going to be the most electable candidate. If, however, voters end up wanting someone they think can right the ship from an unorthodox Trump presidency, Biden’s the right guy."

Recent polls have indicated Sanders’ health scare did not have a negative impact on his standing in the Democrat field. In fact, he has experienced a notable boost since undergoing the emergency heart procedure, both nationally and in key early primary and caucus states.

The Emerson poll, taken November 22-26, 2019, among 549 Democrat primary voters in New Hampshire, showed Sanders taking the lead with 26 percent support. It also indicated Buttigieg on the rise, coming in second place with 22 percent support.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) fell eight points behind the South Bend mayor with 14 percent support each.

According to the survey, Buttigieg fares best among independent voters, earning 29 support. Sanders, Warren, and Biden follow with 21 percent, 12 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

The poll also revealed a major shakeup in the lower tier of candidates, with Rep. Tusi Gabbard (D-HI) and Andrew Yang overtaking Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth and sixth place. They received six percent support, five percent support, and four percent support, respectively. Tom Steyer (D) came in eighth place with three percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:

Emerson notes the results reflect a “major shift” from the New Hampshire poll taken in September, “where Biden led with 24% (-10), followed by Warren with 21% (-7).

“Sanders has jumped from third, where he was at 13% (+13), and Buttigieg also doubled his support from 11% (+11),” Emerson noted.

Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said:

The Democratic voters have taken a look at Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren and they appear unsatisfied at this time which brought some voters back to Bernie Sanders while others are now moving to a fresh face in Pete Buttigieg, this demonstrates the fluidity of the race.

The results coincide with a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released this week, which also showed Sanders retaking the lead in the Granite State. The survey also indicated a surge for Buttigieg, battling Warren for second place 13 percent to her 14 percent. Biden came closely behind with 12 percent support:

Sensing a potential victory in Iowa, Mayor Pete Buttigieg launched an ad that goes after proposals from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to make tuition free at public colleges and universities.

""I believe we should move to make college affordable for everybody,"" Buttigieg says in the ad. ""There are some voices saying, 'Well that doesn't count unless you go even further, unless it's free even for the kids of millionaires. But I only want to make promises that we can keep.""

The mayor's critics have pounced on this line of attack. After all, some of the nation's most successful federal programs — such as Social Security, Medicare and K-12 public education — have been available to all Americans regardless of their income. Surely, he doesn't think that these programs are also misconceived?

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez weighed in with a warning on Twitter : ""This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition free public college.""

To be sure, it is more than legitimate for Democrats to attack proposals from their competitors as too bold or poorly conceived. It is healthy for Democrats to encounter tough criticism from every quarter to see who is best prepared to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.

But Democrats need to be cautious. There is a long history of Republican candidates using smears that unfairly characterize candidates or their policies against the Democratic party nominee. Very often the candidates who think of themselves as the most moderate in the bunch find themselves the target of rhetoric that they or one of their colleagues originally produced.

Democratic candidates who seek to paint themselves as the most moderate in the pack should not forget just how far the GOP is willing go to paint any of the nominees as wild-eyed socialist radicals. Democrats should not underestimate the importance of working as a party to frame the debate around key issues so that they don't end up giving bipartisan legitimacy to spurious conservative talking points.

During the height of the Cold War in the 1940s and 1950s, Democrats often went after each other by accusing others of being soft on communism. Prominent officials in the party castigated the left wing by charging that they were too radical. In doing so, they played into the strategy of equating domestic progressivism and international diplomacy with socialism. Former Vice President Henry Wallace was one of the prime victims of this kind of campaign.

Yet Democrats — from Presidents Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson — learned that they could not contain the fallout from this style of partisan warfare. Eventually, no matter how hawkish the Democrats were, Republicans went after them as being part of the party that was too weak on defense.

When former Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1972, he condemned South Dakota Sen. George McGovern for being weak on defense. Humphrey warned: ""Nor am I going to let Senator McGovern's defense proposals make America into second‐class power.""

McGovern won the nomination. President Richard Nixon put together a fierce campaign that tagged McGovern as a leftist who would endanger national security. Although McGovern had been a staunch internationalist who supported most of the Cold War strategy, Nixon was successful.

In 1984, Democrats were desperate to figure out who was the most electable Democrat to defeat President Ronald Reagan, who in their mind had brought the country into a dangerous era of conservatism, threatening global peace and the social safety net. Ohio Sen. John Glenn, who believed that he had the best chance to beat the Gipper, warned voters that Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale had supported dangerous cuts in defense spending that jeopardized key programs like the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter plane program.

JUST WATCHED Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa 03:29

After Mondale won the nomination, Reagan frequently turned to quotes from Democrats that depicted Mondale as coming from the dovish wing of the party, which he was not.

In 1988, during the Massachusetts primary, Al Gore brought up the state's weekend furlough program for prisoners. He did so to tag the state's technocratic Gov. Michael Dukakis as being far too liberal on crime, a big topic in the 1980s (though the furlough program was started by Dukakis' predecessor).

Republicans remembered what Gore had said when then-Vice President George H.W. Bush faced off against Dukakis in the general election. The GOP injected race into the story by highlighting the case of an African-American man named Willie Horton , who had escaped from the furlough program, raped a white woman and stabbed her partner. The Republican campaign effectively devastated Dukakis's image by summoning the case.

Similarly, in 2004 Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry went after Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who had been doing well in the race, speaking about his opposition to the disastrous war in Iraq. Kerry warned that Dean would be weak on defense after 9/11 and that his candidacy would ensure President George W. Bush's re-election.

Referring to Dean's statement that the US was not safer after Saddam Hussein had been captured, Kerry said: ""Someone who talks like this is going to have a hard time convincing the American people that he can keep them safe. This election is too vital for us to lose ... because voters refuse to take a gamble on national security and the steadiness of our leadership."" Although Kerry won the nomination, that became the centerpiece of GOP attacks against him.

Democrats who attack from the center don't always think through the potential impact of their words. They operate from a mythical position that they will be able to insulate themselves from the same such attacks if their turn comes in the crossfire. But we have seen from history it doesn't work that way.

The better strategy would be to shore up support for Democratic ideas and policies during the caucuses and primaries, insisting on a debate that centers on those terms rather than Republican points, and not offering the GOP more material going into the fall campaign.

For if they are not careful, the moderates might end up doing exactly what Republicans are hoping for, thereby helping to set up the conditions for President Trump's reelection.

Barney Frank (D-MA) said while Democratic presidential primaries were traditionally motivated by progressive ideology, the “anti-Trump” feeling among Democrats was so strong that it is pushing the party to a more electable center.

Frank said, “I do think the most interesting statistic there is take the two candidates who have been talking about being more aimed at beating Trump and more cognizant of the political constraints that exist on very far-reaching measures that’s the Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. They together have many, many more votes than Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. That’s the way it’s focused. Then if you throw in the others like Amy Klobuchar and even Bloomberg, I think the interesting point now is that the view that says it’s important for us to beat Trump and to do that we have to avoid things that are likely to alienate people, like Medicare for all which I agree is a problem. I think that’s a sign maybe after Obama’s speech that a consensus is emerging or at least a strong majority on the Democratic side for electability, still with a very liberal program.”

He continued, “The point is not what the die-hards think, but how many there are? Look at the numbers, look at Biden and Buttigieg and throw in Klobuchar and Bloomberg.”

He added, “Elizabeth Warren is a very intelligent, very smart candidate. She tried to move off of Medicare for all. I don’t think she did it as successfully politically as she was hoping, but she understood that. There are differences between her and Sanders on this. So, yeah, I do think that a majority of those who will vote on the Democratic side — here’s the issue, usually the most ideologically motivated are more likely to vote in primaries. The anti-trump feeling is so strong among Democrats I think for very good reason that it becomes an equal turnout driver with the usual positive ‘Oh, we must make enormous changes.'”

He concluded, “Bloomberg is not pulling the party to the center. He is hoping to catch on to what was already happening. You already have a centrist majority.”

""No, not that guy,"" the narrator says, as an image of Buttigieg flashes on screen. ""It's Cory Booker.""

Although Buttigieg is most often mentioned as a recipient of the prestigious Rhodes scholarship, Booker is the ""Rhodes Scholar mayor"" who ""has what it takes to beat Donald Trump,"" a narrator says in the ad

The spot plays off a memorable moment in the most recent Democratic debate , when Booker referred to himself as ""the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage,"" in a not-so-veiled nod to Buttigieg.

The ad is being bankrolled by United We Win , a super PAC that plans to spend $1 million to help Booker qualify for the December debate. Now that Booker has surpassed the DNC's 200,000-donor threshold, the group is shifting its focus to a two-week sprint to help boost his polling.

But the group's television ad seems to recognize what has been evident in recent polling: that Buttigieg is surging in Iowa as the alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden, shrinking Booker's path there. Booker and his allies hope to make the argument more sharply that he is the only candidate who could bring together all Democrats, including minority voters, and win in November 2020.

""Iowa Democrats want to support a leader with a vision for our country's future, and a Rhodes Scholar mayor is exactly what we need -- but Cory Booker is the only one with a record of delivering real change both in Washington and in his own community,"" said United We Win spokesperson Philip Swibinski. ""Our party needs to rally around a candidate with a progressive platform and a pragmatic, results-oriented outlook in order to beat Donald Trump. Cory Booker exemplifies those qualities better than any other candidate, whether they're a fellow Rhodes Scholar mayor or not.""

Booker reacted on CNN's ""Situation Room"" on Friday, saying he was caught ""a little off-guard"" by the ad, but that he has sought to run a unifying, positive campaign.

""I celebrate the people who are in the race,"" Booker said, ""and my campaign is not about tearing anybody down.""

Booker's campaign announced earlier this week that it would shift its ""entire campaign apparatus into a persuasion effort "" in order to net Booker the four polls he needs by Dec. 12 to secure a spot on the debate stage, reflecting the importance of this marker in the campaign's survival.

But while the campaign plans to spend six figures on digital and radio ads as part of that effort, it concluded that it could not afford to go up on television -- a hole that United We Win is stepping in to fill.

United We Win plans to initially spend $50,000 buying television time for the ad, a source familiar with the group's plans told CNN -- but the group expects that investment to go up. That spend will be part of a $200,000 investment in an ""Iowa Week of Action,"" which will also include digital advertising and a call program focused on the key caucus state."

She then shared the following five points to defend the idea:

1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes & everyone enjoys. We don’t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods. 2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone’s invested! 3. When you start carving people out & adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop. 4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren’t covered by tuition-free public college! 5. Lastly, and I can’t believe we have to remind people of this, but it’s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated. Having students from different incomes & backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society & economic mobility.

Kamala Harris’ (D-CA) 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign is flailing, according to her current and former aides.

A New York Times report reveals warring factions within Harris’ campaign against her Baltimore, Maryland and California-based staff, as well as financial woes that continue to get worse. As part of the Times‘ various interviews with current and former Harris staffers, the report details the recent resignation letter of the campaign’s operations director Kelly Mehlenbacher.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly…” Mehlenbacher wrote. “With less than 90 days until Iowa we still do not have a real plan to win.”

Mehlenbacher wrote that Harris’ campaign lacks “leaders who will lead,” calling the direction of the campaign with Harris’ sister, Maya, at the helm “unacceptable.” Mehlenbacher has since taken a top job for billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s newly-announced Democrat presidential bid.

Those sentiments are reflected in interviews, where one former Harris staffer told the Times that “You can’t run the country if you can’t run your campaign,” when speaking of the campaign’s disarray of messaging and leadership.

Harris’ financial issues have not gotten any better since the last Democrat debate, putting her in a “dire” situation that has left her staff wanting former aides to set up a super PAC to help them run ads that they, themselves, cannot afford [emphasis added]:

But her troubles go beyond staffing and strategy: Her financial predicament is dire. The campaign has not taken a poll or been able to afford TV advertising since September, and it has all but quit buying Facebook ads in the last two months. Her advisers, after months of resistance, have only now signaled their desire for a group of former aides to begin a super PAC to finance an independent political effort on her behalf. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, Harris’ staff complained her message has been all over the place. According to the Times, Harris first chose to use the word “truth” as a campaign slogan because it polled well with focus groups. In recent months, though, Harris has dropped the phrase to focus on the term “justice” where she plays up aspects of her prosecutorial career:

For a time, she sought to highlight a pragmatic agenda, about matters she said voters thought about while lying awake at 3 a.m. Today, her aides are given to gallows humor about just how many slogans and one-liners she has cycled through, with one recalling how “‘speak truth’ spring” gave way to “‘3 a.m.’ summer” before the current, Trump-focused “‘justice’ winter.” [Emphasis added]

Even in Harris’ home state of California, the former prosecutor has failed to break into the top tier of candidates in the state’s Democrat presidential primary — a problem that one of Harris’ donors, Susie Buell admitted to the Times.

“For her to lose California would be really hard and it’s not looking good,” Buell said.

In the latest SurveyUSA poll, Harris runs in fourth with just 10 percent in California behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Harris garners almost as much support in the state as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling at eight percent.

North Carolina will be part of the March 3 Super Tuesday primaries, just four days after neighboring South Carolina holds its primary on February 29.

The influential and highly partisan William Barber II, a compelling orator and founder of Moral Mondays as well as a group called Repairers of the Breach, is the leader of the church in Goldsboro that Buttigieg will be attending.

Last week, for instance, Barber attacked President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, calling them both racists:

Senate Leader McConnell is bolstering Trump’s white nationalism and must also be named as a racist. https://t.co/gwbvWaLJE1 — Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II (@RevDrBarber) November 22, 2019

“There is no question that the president of this country is racist,” Barber wrote in an article published last week at Medium:

His outbursts on social media illustrate that clearly, as do his policies at the border, attempts to end Medicaid expansion, Medicaid work requirements, travel bans, restriction of SNAP benefits, refusal to embrace living wages and judicial appointees. All of these policy positions have a disparate impact on people of color and poor and low wealth people, thereby hurting America and the promise to establish justice. However, anti-racists in this country have a bigger challenge than Trump, and that is his right-hand man, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. By not speaking out against the president’s racist rhetoric and policies and by consistently pursuing an extreme legislative agenda, McConnell is bolstering Trump’s white nationalism and must also be named as a racist.

Barber has a more welcoming message for Buttigieg.

“Barber wrote in a tweet that Greenleaf Christian Church, where he is senior pastor, is happy to welcome Buttigieg and “anyone else who wants to worship the God of love & justice.” He also shared a video of the announcement he made during that day’s church service,” the Charlotte Observer reported:

Barber told the congregation that presidential candidates often ask him if they can come by, and he said “the church is open to everybody. You can come. You can always come and worship. I wish Trump would come. I’d love to preach with him sitting right there, yes I would.” Barber said Buttigieg asked to come but won’t speak during the service. Instead, since he missed an event Barber’s group Repairers of the Breach held about poverty that other Democratic candidates attended, they’ll discuss poverty on Dec. 1 after the service.

Buttigieg, the gay 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has struggled to secure support from black voters, despite his strong showing in recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Black voters are expected to account for an estimated two-thirds of votes cast in the February 29 Democrat primary in South Carolina, while the percentage of black voters in the Democrat caucuses in Iowa and Democrat primary in New Hampshire barely reaches single digits.

A poll of South Carolina Democrat primary voters released in October showed that Buttigieg has no support among that state’s black voters.

Buttigieg’s visit to Barber’s church comes at a time when his campaign is struggling to secure support within the black community.

On Monday, a writer at The Root criticized comments Buttigieg made in 2011 about education in minority neighborhoods, highlighting the political problems he has with the black community.

Michael Harriot referenced an obscure 2011 video in which Buttigieg said, “There are a lot of kids, especially in the lower income minority neighborhoods who literally just haven’t seen it [education] work. There isn’t somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education,” which formed the basis for a highly critical article.

Buttigieg, then 29, made the comments during an interview that aired on South Bend, Indiana, public television station WNIT’s program Politically Speaking in November 2011 during his successful campaign for mayor in that city.

Buttigieg, the Democratic mayoral candidate, appeared on the program with Republican candidate Wayne Curry and Libertarian candidate Pat Farrell.

“Does there need to be an attitude adjustment in our schools so that students that we have are better motivated to learn?” moderator James Wensits asked the three.

“The kids need to see evidence that education’s going to work for them,” Buttigieg said in his response.

Buttigieg continued:

You’re motivated because you believe at the end of your educational process, there’s a reward. There’s a stable life. There’s a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially in the lower income minority neighborhoods who literally just haven’t seen it work. There isn’t somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.

Although Buttigieg’s comments were not viewed as particularly controversial by either the moderator or the other two candidates at the time, Harriot took strong exception to Buttigieg’s 2011 comments in the article published at The Root on Monday.

In an expletive-filled essay, Harriot asserted that Buttigieg “knows that everything he just said is a baldfaced lie”:

Majority-minority schools receive $23 billion less in funding than majority-white schools, according to a recent study by EdBuild. Black students in Indiana, the state where Buttigieg serves as mayor, and across the country, are disciplined more harshly than white students. But even though Buttigieg has never attended a school with more than 10 percent black students, he thinks he knows what’s stopping black kids from achieving their educational dreams. Apparently, it’s not the fact that the unemployment rate for black college graduates is twice as high as the unemployment rate for white grads. Black college graduates are paid 80 cents for every dollar a white person with the same education earns. White people leave college with lower debt and higher earnings. White kids get more resources, more advanced classes and have access to more technology. But Pete says it could all be solved with a vision-board.

Buttigieg easily won the November 8, 2011, election to become one of the youngest mayors in the country and the second youngest mayor ever in the city with just over 100,000 residents, winning 74 percent of the vote.

Watch the full interview below. Buttigieg’s answer begins at the 27:30 mark:

Buttigieg’s comments, Harriot argued in his article, “proves men like him are more willing to perpetuate the fantastic narrative of negro neighborhoods needing more role models and briefcase-carriers than make the people in power stare into the sun and see the blinding light of racism.”

“Pete Buttigieg doesn’t want to change anything. He just wants to be something,” Harriot added:

This is not just a lie of omission, it is a dangerous precedent. This is why institutional inequality persists. Not because of white hoods and racial slurs. It is because this insidious double-talk erases the problem by camouflaging it. Because it is painted as a problem of black lethargy and not white apathy. Pete Buttigieg is standing over a dying man, holding the oxygen machine in his hand and telling everyone: “Nah, he doesn’t need CPR. He’s just holding his breath.” Negligent homicide is still homicide.

On Tuesday, Buttigieg called Harriot to discuss the article. Harriot reported a portion of what they discussed:

Pete Buttigieg didn’t want to tell me his side of the story. He didn’t excuse himself by explaining that the comments referenced by the article were made years ago. He didn’t even try to explain his plan for black America. “I think the context was important, especially the fact that it was before I took office,” Buttigieg said. But mostly, he just wanted to listen. For 18 minutes and 45 seconds, we talked about educational inequality, poverty and institutional racism in America and how to fix it. … “Every study and data point shows that racism is baked into the education system,” I explained. “If your goal was to fix the problems in America’s schools, why would you even mention ‘confidence?’ A president can’t fix confidence. And you can’t say: ‘Black kids don’t have confidence in the system’ without pointing out all of the reasons they shouldn’t have confidence in the system.”

Buttigieg’s dust-up with Harriot is unlikely to change black voters’ attitudes toward Buttigieg, as Harriot noted on Tuesday:

And, as I told the mayor, the article wasn’t meant to inspire outrage. Its purpose was to make a necessary point about black voters and real issues. There is no way that I can know if he is genuinely interested in engaging black voters, attacking discrimination or crossing the racial divide. There are an infinite number of candidates who have waded into black barbershops or sashayed into black pulpits to assure us that they were on our side when they were only interested in our vote. I am not smart or prescient enough to tell the difference. The only thing I actually know about Pete Buttigieg is that he is a white man. But Pete Buttigieg listened, which is all you can ask a white man to do. Unless, of course, he wants to fight.

The Buttigieg campaign is hoping Sunday’s visit to William Barber II’s church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, will fare better than his exchange with Harriot."

Sensing a potential victory in Iowa, Mayor Pete Buttigieg launched an ad that goes after proposals from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to make tuition free at public colleges and universities.

""I believe we should move to make college affordable for everybody,"" Buttigieg says in the ad. ""There are some voices saying, 'Well that doesn't count unless you go even further, unless it's free even for the kids of millionaires. But I only want to make promises that we can keep.""

The mayor's critics have pounced on this line of attack. After all, some of the nation's most successful federal programs — such as Social Security, Medicare and K-12 public education — have been available to all Americans regardless of their income. Surely, he doesn't think that these programs are also misconceived?

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez weighed in with a warning on Twitter : ""This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems & it's sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition free public college.""

To be sure, it is more than legitimate for Democrats to attack proposals from their competitors as too bold or poorly conceived. It is healthy for Democrats to encounter tough criticism from every quarter to see who is best prepared to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.

But Democrats need to be cautious. There is a long history of Republican candidates using smears that unfairly characterize candidates or their policies against the Democratic party nominee. Very often the candidates who think of themselves as the most moderate in the bunch find themselves the target of rhetoric that they or one of their colleagues originally produced.

Democratic candidates who seek to paint themselves as the most moderate in the pack should not forget just how far the GOP is willing go to paint any of the nominees as wild-eyed socialist radicals. Democrats should not underestimate the importance of working as a party to frame the debate around key issues so that they don't end up giving bipartisan legitimacy to spurious conservative talking points.

During the height of the Cold War in the 1940s and 1950s, Democrats often went after each other by accusing others of being soft on communism. Prominent officials in the party castigated the left wing by charging that they were too radical. In doing so, they played into the strategy of equating domestic progressivism and international diplomacy with socialism. Former Vice President Henry Wallace was one of the prime victims of this kind of campaign.

Yet Democrats — from Presidents Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson — learned that they could not contain the fallout from this style of partisan warfare. Eventually, no matter how hawkish the Democrats were, Republicans went after them as being part of the party that was too weak on defense.

When former Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1972, he condemned South Dakota Sen. George McGovern for being weak on defense. Humphrey warned: ""Nor am I going to let Senator McGovern's defense proposals make America into second‐class power.""

McGovern won the nomination. President Richard Nixon put together a fierce campaign that tagged McGovern as a leftist who would endanger national security. Although McGovern had been a staunch internationalist who supported most of the Cold War strategy, Nixon was successful.

In 1984, Democrats were desperate to figure out who was the most electable Democrat to defeat President Ronald Reagan, who in their mind had brought the country into a dangerous era of conservatism, threatening global peace and the social safety net. Ohio Sen. John Glenn, who believed that he had the best chance to beat the Gipper, warned voters that Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale had supported dangerous cuts in defense spending that jeopardized key programs like the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter plane program.

After Mondale won the nomination, Reagan frequently turned to quotes from Democrats that depicted Mondale as coming from the dovish wing of the party, which he was not.

In 1988, during the Massachusetts primary, Al Gore brought up the state's weekend furlough program for prisoners. He did so to tag the state's technocratic Gov. Michael Dukakis as being far too liberal on crime, a big topic in the 1980s (though the furlough program was started by Dukakis' predecessor).

Republicans remembered what Gore had said when then-Vice President George H.W. Bush faced off against Dukakis in the general election. The GOP injected race into the story by highlighting the case of an African-American man named Willie Horton , who had escaped from the furlough program, raped a white woman and stabbed her partner. The Republican campaign effectively devastated Dukakis's image by summoning the case.

Similarly, in 2004 Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry went after Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who had been doing well in the race, speaking about his opposition to the disastrous war in Iraq. Kerry warned that Dean would be weak on defense after 9/11 and that his candidacy would ensure President George W. Bush's re-election.

Referring to Dean's statement that the US was not safer after Saddam Hussein had been captured, Kerry said: ""Someone who talks like this is going to have a hard time convincing the American people that he can keep them safe. This election is too vital for us to lose ... because voters refuse to take a gamble on national security and the steadiness of our leadership."" Although Kerry won the nomination, that became the centerpiece of GOP attacks against him.

Democrats who attack from the center don't always think through the potential impact of their words. They operate from a mythical position that they will be able to insulate themselves from the same such attacks if their turn comes in the crossfire. But we have seen from history it doesn't work that way.

The better strategy would be to shore up support for Democratic ideas and policies during the caucuses and primaries, insisting on a debate that centers on those terms rather than Republican points, and not offering the GOP more material going into the fall campaign.

For if they are not careful, the moderates might end up doing exactly what Republicans are hoping for, thereby helping to set up the conditions for President Trump's reelection.

Barney Frank (D-MA) said while Democratic presidential primaries were traditionally motivated by progressive ideology, the “anti-Trump” feeling among Democrats was so strong that it is pushing the party to a more electable center.

Frank said, “I do think the most interesting statistic there is take the two candidates who have been talking about being more aimed at beating Trump and more cognizant of the political constraints that exist on very far-reaching measures that’s the Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. They together have many, many more votes than Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. That’s the way it’s focused. Then if you throw in the others like Amy Klobuchar and even Bloomberg, I think the interesting point now is that the view that says it’s important for us to beat Trump and to do that we have to avoid things that are likely to alienate people, like Medicare for all which I agree is a problem. I think that’s a sign maybe after Obama’s speech that a consensus is emerging or at least a strong majority on the Democratic side for electability, still with a very liberal program.”

He continued, “The point is not what the die-hards think, but how many there are? Look at the numbers, look at Biden and Buttigieg and throw in Klobuchar and Bloomberg.”

He added, “Elizabeth Warren is a very intelligent, very smart candidate. She tried to move off of Medicare for all. I don’t think she did it as successfully politically as she was hoping, but she understood that. There are differences between her and Sanders on this. So, yeah, I do think that a majority of those who will vote on the Democratic side — here’s the issue, usually the most ideologically motivated are more likely to vote in primaries. The anti-trump feeling is so strong among Democrats I think for very good reason that it becomes an equal turnout driver with the usual positive ‘Oh, we must make enormous changes.'”

He concluded, “Bloomberg is not pulling the party to the center. He is hoping to catch on to what was already happening. You already have a centrist majority.”

""No, not that guy,"" the narrator says, as an image of Buttigieg flashes on screen. ""It's Cory Booker.""

Although Buttigieg is most often mentioned as a recipient of the prestigious Rhodes scholarship, Booker is the ""Rhodes Scholar mayor"" who ""has what it takes to beat Donald Trump,"" a narrator says in the ad

The spot plays off a memorable moment in the most recent Democratic debate , when Booker referred to himself as ""the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on this stage,"" in a not-so-veiled nod to Buttigieg.

The ad is being bankrolled by United We Win , a super PAC that plans to spend $1 million to help Booker qualify for the December debate. Now that Booker has surpassed the DNC's 200,000-donor threshold, the group is shifting its focus to a two-week sprint to help boost his polling.

But the group's television ad seems to recognize what has been evident in recent polling: that Buttigieg is surging in Iowa as the alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden, shrinking Booker's path there. Booker and his allies hope to make the argument more sharply that he is the only candidate who could bring together all Democrats, including minority voters, and win in November 2020.

""Iowa Democrats want to support a leader with a vision for our country's future, and a Rhodes Scholar mayor is exactly what we need -- but Cory Booker is the only one with a record of delivering real change both in Washington and in his own community,"" said United We Win spokesperson Philip Swibinski. ""Our party needs to rally around a candidate with a progressive platform and a pragmatic, results-oriented outlook in order to beat Donald Trump. Cory Booker exemplifies those qualities better than any other candidate, whether they're a fellow Rhodes Scholar mayor or not.""

Booker reacted on CNN's ""Situation Room"" on Friday, saying he was caught ""a little off-guard"" by the ad, but that he has sought to run a unifying, positive campaign.

""I celebrate the people who are in the race,"" Booker said, ""and my campaign is not about tearing anybody down.""

Booker's campaign announced earlier this week that it would shift its ""entire campaign apparatus into a persuasion effort "" in order to net Booker the four polls he needs by Dec. 12 to secure a spot on the debate stage, reflecting the importance of this marker in the campaign's survival.

But while the campaign plans to spend six figures on digital and radio ads as part of that effort, it concluded that it could not afford to go up on television -- a hole that United We Win is stepping in to fill.

United We Win plans to initially spend $50,000 buying television time for the ad, a source familiar with the group's plans told CNN -- but the group expects that investment to go up. That spend will be part of a $200,000 investment in an ""Iowa Week of Action,"" which will also include digital advertising and a call program focused on the key caucus state."

She then shared the following five points to defend the idea:

1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes & everyone enjoys. We don’t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods. 2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone’s invested! 3. When you start carving people out & adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop. 4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren’t covered by tuition-free public college! 5. Lastly, and I can’t believe we have to remind people of this, but it’s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated. Having students from different incomes & backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society & economic mobility.

Biden, who has been eclipsed by the likes of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in Iowa and New Hampshire, continues to dominate the Democrat field in South Carolina. Since announcing his candidacy in April, the former vice president has led in every single poll coming out of Palmetto State by double digits.

Biden’s standing among South Carolina Democrats was on display in a recent CBS/YouGov survey that found the former vice president leading his nearest challenger, Warren, by 28 percentage points. The former vice president’s dominance has been mostly fueled by strong support from black voters, who by most estimates will make up more than 60 percent of South Carolina’s primary electorate in 2020. An October poll conducted by Winthrop University indicated Biden was the favored candidate of 46 percent of black Democrats across South Carolina.

Such strong support from the black community is mirrored nationally and has remained unabated despite contentious revelations about the former vice president’s opposition to busing and his more recent praise of segregationist Democrats. Now some strategists wonder, however, if black voters will stick by Biden were he to falter in the first three nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire, in Nevada.

“The support won’t be there if he’s slipping,” a Democrat strategist told the Hill. “There’s just no way.”

The notion of Biden not winning, let alone landing in the top three in the Iowa Caucuses or the New Hampshire and Nevada primaries, seemed impossible when he first entered the race.

A poll conducted in Iowa only a month after Biden’s announcement, found the former vice president leading his rivals by nearly ten percentage points. Biden maintained that lead until early September, when news of his youngest son’s foreign wheeling and dealing took center stage in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Since then, Biden has steadily fallen, most recently hitting fourth place in Iowa behind Buttigieg, Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

Similarly, the former vice president has lost ground in New Hampshire, which at one point seemed like fertile territory given its large working class population. Polling conducted by Monmouth University in May had Biden commanding 36 percent of New Hampshire’s Democrat electorate, 18 percentage points more than his nearest rival. Now the former vice president finds himself firmly in fourth place behind Buttigieg, Sanders, and Warren, according to polling averages analyzed by Real Clear Politics.

Of the three early nominating contests prior to South Carolina, Nevada seems to present Biden’s brightest opportunity. The former vice president continues to hold a healthy lead over his rivals in the state, as much as ten percentage points according to a recent survey.

Although Nevada looks promising for Biden, the state is by no means a lock. Not only is Nevada a caucus state with its own intrepid procedures for gauging candidate support, but its Democrat electorate is heavily influenced by both former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and the heavily Hispanic Culinary Workers Union.

Reid, for his part, has opted against endorsing a candidate as of yet, in hopes of using his wide reaching political machine to play kingmaker down the line. Even though Reid has yet to make an endorsement, his former top Senate staffers have been openly critical of Biden.

Adding to the former vice president’s problems in Nevada is the likelihood that his moderate stand on immigration will be a nonstarter for many of the state’s Hispanic activists, including those belonging to groups like the Culinary Workers Union. The union, which represents more than 60,000 hospitality workers from 173 different countries, is both Nevada’s largest labor organization and its biggest immigrant advocacy group.

In recent years, the union has taken a more proactive stance on protecting its members from facing deportation or being subject to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Earlier this month, the union snubbed Biden, who has refused to end all deportations if elected president, in favor of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with an invitation to address its membership.

Biden’s precarious standing in Nevada and his overall troubles in Iowa and New Hampshire pose the very real possibility that the former vice president will be running far behind by the time voters go to the polls in South Carolina. If that is the case, senior Democrats believe black voters will have no choice but to start considering other candidates, especially as momentum and media attention will be focused on those who finished at the top in the three early states.

“Savvy black voters will reassess their options,” Basil Smikle, a Democrat strategist, told the Hill when asked about Biden’s chances of keeping black voters in his column. “Every candidate will have to remake their case to, and reaffirm their policy prescriptions for, the African American community — Biden included.”

Complicating matters for the former vice president is that he has history working against him. In recent memory, only two candidates for either the Democrat or Republican nominations have gone on to win South Carolina after faltering in the first three nominating contest.

In both cases, John Edwards in 2004 and Newt Gingrich in 2012, the victories in South Carolina served as temporary aberrations. Not only did further wins fail to materialize, but both candidates were outflanked in the money and resources race by the eventual nominee, who had scored early and decisive victories in the first three contests.

Biden, himself, seems to understand that a loss in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada would likely impact his credibility as a candidate with black voters in South Carolina. As such, the former vice president’s campaign has made a massive investment of time and advertising in Iowa in recent weeks despite downplaying its chances in the state in September.

“Losing Iowa doesn’t mean we can’t win, but it makes winning the primary harder and more expensive,” Greg Schultz, Biden’s campaign manager, wrote in a recent fundraising email to supporters. “We still have time to turn this around … but not much.”"

A New York Times report reveals warring factions within Harris’ campaign against her Baltimore, Maryland and California-based staff, as well as financial woes that continue to get worse. As part of the Times‘ various interviews with current and former Harris staffers, the report details the recent resignation letter of the campaign’s operations director Kelly Mehlenbacher.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly…” Mehlenbacher wrote. “With less than 90 days until Iowa we still do not have a real plan to win.”

Mehlenbacher wrote that Harris’ campaign lacks “leaders who will lead,” calling the direction of the campaign with Harris’ sister, Maya, at the helm “unacceptable.” Mehlenbacher has since taken a top job for billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s newly-announced Democrat presidential bid.

Those sentiments are reflected in interviews, where one former Harris staffer told the Times that “You can’t run the country if you can’t run your campaign,” when speaking of the campaign’s disarray of messaging and leadership.

Harris’ financial issues have not gotten any better since the last Democrat debate, putting her in a “dire” situation that has left her staff wanting former aides to set up a super PAC to help them run ads that they, themselves, cannot afford [emphasis added]:

But her troubles go beyond staffing and strategy: Her financial predicament is dire. The campaign has not taken a poll or been able to afford TV advertising since September, and it has all but quit buying Facebook ads in the last two months. Her advisers, after months of resistance, have only now signaled their desire for a group of former aides to begin a super PAC to finance an independent political effort on her behalf. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, Harris’ staff complained her message has been all over the place. According to the Times, Harris first chose to use the word “truth” as a campaign slogan because it polled well with focus groups. In recent months, though, Harris has dropped the phrase to focus on the term “justice” where she plays up aspects of her prosecutorial career:

For a time, she sought to highlight a pragmatic agenda, about matters she said voters thought about while lying awake at 3 a.m. Today, her aides are given to gallows humor about just how many slogans and one-liners she has cycled through, with one recalling how “‘speak truth’ spring” gave way to “‘3 a.m.’ summer” before the current, Trump-focused “‘justice’ winter.” [Emphasis added]

Even in Harris’ home state of California, the former prosecutor has failed to break into the top tier of candidates in the state’s Democrat presidential primary — a problem that one of Harris’ donors, Susie Buell admitted to the Times.

“For her to lose California would be really hard and it’s not looking good,” Buell said.

In the latest SurveyUSA poll, Harris runs in fourth with just 10 percent in California behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Harris garners almost as much support in the state as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling at eight percent.
