His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire?

“Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”).

Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body. He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger o r the urgency that I feel.”

His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase.

Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’”

“And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’”

Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president. From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition. He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away."

“My first year, I said, ‘This is what I should be doing,’” Bochy said last Wednesday on the bench before his 2,000th career victory that night. “I loved it. Not that I thought I was any good at it, but I wanted to get better at it.”

Bochy was born in Landes de Bussac , France; his father , Gus, was a sergeant major in the United States Army. The family — with three boys and a girl — moved often, including spending about three years in the Panama Canal Zone. Bochy would play sports with his brother Joe, older by three and a half years, and Joe’s friends.

“Our father believed that listening was a great leadership skill, and you didn’t want to be a follower growing up,” said Joe Bochy, who is also retiring this year from a scouting job with the Giants. “You wanted to hang around people smarter than you so you could learn.”

Gus Bochy grew up as a switch-hitting shortstop and filled the home with baseball broadcasts on Armed Forces Radio. He made his sons catchers because they were slow; he would joke that they inherited their lack of speed from their mother, Rose, who once filled in as coach for the Little League team and ran drills when Joe was gone.

Bochy reached the majors with Houston in 1978 , then played briefly for the Mets in 1982 before five seasons with the Padres. He played in two postseason games : in the 1980 National League Championship Series, when the Phillies’ Pete Rose knocked him over with a forearm to the face at the Astrodome (Bochy got right up), and in the 1984 World Series at Tiger Stadium, when Bochy singled in his only at-bat.

That appearance came in the last inning of the series, a sentimental gesture from the Padres’ gruff manager, Dick Williams. Bochy had a gentler personality, and General Manager Jack McKeon — who was also a longtime manager — kept him in the organization after his final season in the minors in 1988."

For the first time in The Register’s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent.

“This is the first major shake-up” of the race, The Register’s pollster, Ann Selzer, told the paper.

The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else.

Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual.

“You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.”

Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa.

“I don’t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,” he said. “I’d be shocked if it’s more than five.”"

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

To the Editor:

I find it interesting that someone like Imani Perry, who is considered a scholar, would describe Jane Austen’s novels as literature for “parlor people” (By the Book, Sept. 15). In academic circles, Austen is considered a classic, along with Dickens, Hardy and others. She also has quite a lot to say to modern society about manners, behavior toward others, empathy, ethics and other civilized subjects that seem to have fallen out of favor.

Unfortunately, many of today’s writers have more in common with psychiatrists, preferring, it seems, to publish depressing, despairing downers in the name of literature. They appear to be more concerned with mental anguish than with telling a good story with good characters.

Jane Austen wrote about more than her own time; her books remain popular because she describes human beings for all time.

I couldn’t agree more with Professor Perry. I have enjoyed pull quotes from Henry James and Jane Austen, but reading their prose — forget about it! Perry’s description of it as “parlor” literature is so apt. Her remarks confirmed my instincts."

To the Editor:

I find it interesting that someone like Imani Perry, who is considered a scholar, would describe Jane Austen’s novels as literature for “parlor people” (By the Book, Sept. 15). In academic circles, Austen is considered a classic, along with Dickens, Hardy and others. She also has quite a lot to say to modern society about manners, behavior toward others, empathy, ethics and other civilized subjects that seem to have fallen out of favor.

Unfortunately, many of today’s writers have more in common with psychiatrists, preferring, it seems, to publish depressing, despairing downers in the name of literature. They appear to be more concerned with mental anguish than with telling a good story with good characters.

Jane Austen wrote about more than her own time; her books remain popular because she describes human beings for all time.

Criminals are increasingly “going dark” to hide their tracks. They are using virtual private networks to mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques to obscure their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the so-called dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

As the technologies lower people’s inhibitions, online groups are sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Illinois who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Lawmakers foresaw the crisis years ago, but enforcement has fallen short

Congress passed a landmark law in 2008 that foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation. Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. And although a senior executive-level official was to oversee the federal response at the Justice Department, that has not happened.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Stacie B. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

Law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up

With so many reports of the images coming their way, police departments across the country are besieged. Some have managed their workload by focusing efforts on imagery depicting the youngest, most vulnerable victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

About one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section is assigned to child sexual exploitation cases, officials said, a clear indication of how big the problem is.

Last year, tech companies reported over 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused — more than double what they found the previous year.

Online predators create and share the illegal material, which is increasingly cloaked by technology. Tech companies, the government and the authorities are no match.

The images are horrific. Children, some just 3 or 4 years old, being sexually abused and in some cases tortured.

Pictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared to satisfy twisted adult obsessions. But it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.

More than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than a million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.

Yet the explosion in detected content kept growing — exponentially.

Exploited Articles in this series examine the explosion in online photos and videos of children being sexually abused. They include graphic descriptions of some instances of the abuse.

An investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. As with hate speech and terrorist propaganda, many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms, or failed to cooperate sufficiently with the authorities when they found it.

Law enforcement agencies devoted to the problem were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.

The Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery — the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities — was ill equipped for the expanding demands.

A paper recently published in conjunction with that group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, described a system at “a breaking point,” with reports of abusive images “exceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.” It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with the criminals.

In 1998, there were over 3,000 reports of child sexual abuse imagery. Just over a decade later, yearly reports soared past 100,000. In 2014, that number surpassed 1 million for the first time. Last year, there were 18.4 million, more than one-third of the total ever reported. Those reports included over 45 million images and videos flagged as child sexual abuse. By Rich Harris | Source: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

The Times reviewed over 10,000 pages of police and court documents; conducted software tests to assess the availability of the imagery through search engines; accompanied detectives on raids; and spoke with investigators, lawmakers, tech executives and government officials. The reporting included conversations with an admitted pedophile who concealed his identity using encryption software and who runs a site that has hosted as many as 17,000 such images.

In interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Children, raped by relatives and strangers alike, being told it was normal. Adults, now years removed from their abuse, still living in fear of being recognized from photos and videos on the internet. And parents of the abused, struggling to cope with the guilt of not having prevented it and their powerlessness over stopping its online spread.

Many of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.

“I don’t really know how to deal with it,” said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. “You’re just trying to feel O.K. and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is — that’s the thing that keeps this alive.”

The Times’s reporting revealed a problem global in scope — most of the images found last year were traced to other countries — but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery’s spread and in reporting it to the authorities.

While the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed the images to multiply at an alarming rate. Both recirculated and new images occupy all corners of the internet, including a range of platforms as diverse as Facebook Messenger, Microsoft’s Bing search engine and the storage service Dropbox.

In a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. In some online forums, children are forced to hold up signs with the name of the group or other identifying information to prove the images are fresh.

To report online child sexual abuse, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.

With so many reports of the abuse coming their way, law enforcement agencies across the country said they were often besieged. Some have managed their online workload by focusing on imagery depicting the youngest victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

In some sense, increased detection of the spiraling problem is a sign of progress. Tech companies are legally required to report images of child abuse only when they discover them; they are not required to look for them.

After years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, stepped up surveillance of their platforms. In interviews, executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.

But police records and emails, as well as interviews with nearly three dozen local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.

And when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to the authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

All the while, criminals continue to trade and stockpile caches of the material.

The law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.

The Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports that are meant to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department’s efforts. The first person to hold the position, Francey Hakes, said it was clear from the outset that no one “felt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.”

The federal government has also not lived up to the law’s funding goals, severely crippling efforts to stamp out the activity.

Congress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement — depleting 40 percent of the units’ discretionary budget until the final month of the fiscal year.

Alicia Kozakiewicz, who was abducted by a man she had met on the internet when she was 13, said the lack of follow-through was disheartening. Now an advocate for laws preventing crimes against children, she had testified in support of the 2008 legislation.

“I remember looking around the room, and there wasn’t a dry eye,” said Ms. Kozakiewicz, 31, who had told of being chained, raped and beaten while her kidnapper live-streamed the abuse on the internet. “The federal bill passed, but it wasn’t funded. So it didn’t mean anything.”

Further impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.

The nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.

“To be honest, it’s a resource and volume issue,” said John Shehan, a vice president at the center, which was established 35 years ago to track missing children. “First priority is making sure we’re assessing the risk of the children. We’re getting this information into the hands of law enforcement.”

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida who was an author of the 2008 law, said in an interview that she was unaware of the extent of the federal government’s failures. After being briefed on The Times’s findings, she sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting an accounting.

Stacie B. Harris, the Justice Department’s coordinator over the past year for combating child exploitation, said the problem was systemic, extending well beyond the department and her tenure there. “We are trying to play catch-up because we know that this is a huge, huge problem,” said Ms. Harris, an associate deputy attorney general.

The fallout for law enforcement, in some instances, has been crushing.

When reviewing tips from the national center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has narrowed its focus to images of infants and toddlers. And about one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section — which deals with all kinds of threats, including terrorism — is now assigned to child sexual exploitation cases.

“We could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,” said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.

The Cutting Edge

The videos found on the computer of an Ohio man were described by investigators as among “the most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.”

One showed a woman orally forcing herself on a girl who was then held upside down by the ankles in a bathroom while “another child urinates” on her face, according to court documents.

Another showed a woman “inserting an ice cube into the vagina” of a young girl, the documents said, before tying her ankles together, taping her mouth shut and suspending her upside down. As the video continued, the girl was beaten, slapped and burned with a match or candle.

“The predominant sound is the child screaming and crying,” according to a federal agent quoted in the documents.

The videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted, one common way abusive imagery has been able to race across the internet with impunity.

Increasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of the police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had over 3 million photos and videos on his computers.

The site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to the court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves. They were known as “producers.”

Multiple police investigations over the past few years have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child’s Play that was reported to have had over a million user accounts.

The highly skilled perpetrators often taunt the authorities with their technical skills, acting boldly because they feel protected by the cover of darkness.

“People who traffic in child exploitation materials are on the cutting edge of technology,” said Susan Hennessey, a former lawyer at the National Security Agency who researches cybersecurity at the Brookings Institution.

Offenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

The anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Exhibits in the case of the Love Zone, sealed by the court but released by a judge after a request by The Times, include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain “safe” while posting and downloading the imagery. Tips included tutorials on how to encrypt and share material without being detected by the authorities.

The offender in Ohio, a site administrator named Jason Gmoser, “went to great lengths to hide” his conduct, according to the documents. Testimony in his criminal case revealed that it would have taken the authorities “trillions of years” to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over to investigators, and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.

The site was run by a number of men, including Brian Davis, a worker at a child day care center in Illinois who admitted to documenting abuse of his own godson and more than a dozen other children — aged 3 months to 8 years — and sharing images of the assaults with other members. Mr. Davis made over 400 posts on the site. One image showed him orally raping a 2-year-old; another depicted a man raping an infant’s anus.

Mr. Davis, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2016, said that “capturing the abuse on video was part of the excitement,” according to court records.

Some of his victims attended the court proceedings and submitted statements about their continuing struggles with the abuse.

‘Truly Terrible Things’

The surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.

The companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way, according to interviews and emails detailing the companies’ activities. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.

Hemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases, said it was clear more than two decades ago that new technologies had created the biggest boon for pedophiles since the Polaroid camera.

The recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse “wouldn’t exist if they did their job then,” said Mr. Nigam, who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm and previously held top security roles at Microsoft, Myspace and News Corporation.

Hany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material, said tech companies had been reluctant for years to dig too deeply.

“The companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,” he said. “And then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.”

Federal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from the authorities to reach companies too late.

“That’s a huge issue for us,” said Capt. Mike Edwards, a Seattle police commander who oversees a cybercrimes unit for the State of Washington. “You’ve got a short period of time to be able to get the data if it was preserved.”

Most tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. In interviews, law enforcement officials pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies.

Police officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin lamented Tumblr’s poor response to requests, with one officer describing the issues as “long-term and ongoing” in an internal document.

A recent investigation in Polk County, Wis., that included an image of a man orally raping a young child stalled for over a year. The investigator retired before Tumblr responded to numerous emails requesting information.

In a 2016 Wisconsin case, Tumblr alerted a person who had uploaded explicit images that the account had been referred to the authorities, a practice that a former employee told The Times had been common for years. The tip allowed the man to destroy evidence on his electronic devices, the police said.

A spokeswoman for Verizon said that Tumblr prioritized time-sensitive cases, which delayed other responses. Since Verizon acquired the company in 2017, the spokeswoman said, its practice was not to alert users of police requests for data. Verizon recently sold Tumblr to the web development company Automattic.

The law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft’s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat.

Bing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult, if not impossible. Snapchat, a platform especially popular with young people, is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time. According to law enforcement, when requests are made to the company, Snap often replies that it has no additional information.

A Microsoft spokesman said that the company had only limited information about offenders using the search engine, and that it was cooperating as best as it could. A Snap spokesman said the company preserved data in compliance with the law.

Data obtained through a public records request suggests Facebook’s plans to encrypt Messenger in the coming years will lead to vast numbers of images of child abuse going undetected. The data shows that WhatsApp, the company’s encrypted messaging app, submits only a small fraction of the reports Messenger does.

Facebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for “truly terrible things like child exploitation.”

“Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy,” he said, “but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.”

‘Vastly Inadequate’

“In a recent case, an offender filmed himself drugging the juice boxes of neighborhood children before tricking them into drinking the mix,” said Special Agent Flint Waters, a criminal investigator for the State of Wyoming. “He then filmed himself as he sexually abused unconscious children.”

Mr. Waters, appearing before Congress in Washington, was describing what he said “we see every day.”

He went on to present a map of the United States covered with red dots, each representing a computer used to share images of child sex abuse. Fewer than two percent of the crimes would be investigated, he predicted. “We are overwhelmed, we are underfunded and we are drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy,” he said.

Mr. Waters’s testimony was delivered 12 years ago — in 2007.

The following year, Congress passed legislation that acknowledged the severity of the crisis. But then the federal government largely moved on. Some of the strongest provisions of the law were not fulfilled, and many problems went unfixed, according to interviews and government documents.

Today, Mr. Waters’s testimony offers a haunting reminder of time lost.

Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut who was a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, the biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. Even the most recent of the two reports that were published, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as the trade in illicit imagery.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Ms. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

When the law was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position with broad authority. That has not happened. “This is supposed to be the quarterback,” said Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of the provision’s authors.

Even when the Justice Department has been publicly called out for ignoring provisions of the law, there has been little change.

In 2011, the Government Accountability Office reported that no steps had been taken to research which online offenders posed a high risk to children, and that the Justice Department had not submitted a progress assessment to Congress, both requirements of the law.

At the time, the department said it did not have enough funding to undertake the research and had no “time frame” for submitting a report. Today, the provisions remain largely unfulfilled.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which testified in favor of the 2008 law, has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.

Founded in 1984 after the well-publicized kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old Florida boy, Adam Walsh, the center has been closely affiliated with the federal government since the Reagan administration.

But as child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998, nearly a decade before the first iPhone was released. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.

The center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don’t stop there. The police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely.

“We’re spending a tremendous amount of time having to go through those and reanalyze them ourselves,” said Captain Edwards, the Seattle police official.

In a statement, the national center said it did its best to route reports to the correct jurisdiction.

Despite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency. It repeatedly denied requests from The Times for quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Justice Department, as well as for tallies of imagery reports submitted by individual tech companies.

Mr. Shehan, the vice president, said such disclosures might discourage tech companies from cooperating with the center. He said the numbers could be misinterpreted.

The Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about good governance practices. For example, the center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. Google alone has donated nearly $4 million in the past decade, according to public testimony.

A spokeswoman for the center said it was common to expect corporations to provide financial assistance to charities. But the practice, others working in the area of child protection say, could elevate the interests of the tech companies above the children’s.

“There’s an inherent conflict in accepting money from these companies when they also sit on your board,” said Signy Arnason, who is a top executive at the equivalent organization in Canada, known as the Canadian Center for Child Protection.

This close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.

If that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates and how tech companies find and remove illegal imagery on their platforms. Under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, the companies fear, they could also be viewed as government actors, not private entities, subjecting them to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.

An Ugly Mirror

It was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house. Garden gnomes and a heart-shaped “Welcome Friends” sign decorated the front yard.

At the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated in a cramped interrogation area, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers.

The man had shared sexually explicit videos online, the police said, including one of a 10-year-old boy being “orally sodomized” by a man, and another of a man forcing two young boys to engage in anal intercourse.

“The sad thing is that’s pretty tame compared to what we’ve seen,” said Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general’s office who led a raid of the house. The victims have not been identified or rescued.

The year was barely half over, and Chief Farnsworth’s team had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates state and regional responses to internet crimes against children.

The Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year for crimes related to child sexual abuse material, but federal funding has not kept pace with the surge. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400 percent.

Much of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.

“I thought that I was in the underbelly of society — until I came here,” said Ms. Lippert, the prosecutor with the task force in Illinois, who had worked for years at a busy Chicago courthouse.

While any child at imminent risk remains a priority, the volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations, including infiltrating chat rooms and online forums.

“I think some of the bigger fish who are out there are staying out there,” Ms. Lippert said.

The internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action.

But the problem of child sexual abuse imagery faces a particular hurdle: It gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content, or they wrongly dismiss it as primarily teenagers sending inappropriate selfies.

Some state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings when it was on the agenda, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.

Steven J. Grocki, who leads a group of policy experts and lawyers at the child exploitation section of the Justice Department, said the reluctance to address the issue went beyond elected officials and was a societal problem. “They turn away from it because it’s too ugly of a mirror,” he said.

Yet the material is everywhere, and ever more available.

“I think that people were always there, but the access is so easy,” said Lt. John Pizzuro, a task force commander in New Jersey. “You got nine million people in the state of New Jersey. Based upon statistics, we can probably arrest 400,000 people.”

Common language about the abuse can also minimize the harm in people’s minds. While the imagery is often defined as “child pornography” in state and federal laws, experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography, which is legal for people over 18.

“Each and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,” said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. “The violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.”"

Criminals are increasingly “going dark” to hide their tracks. They are using virtual private networks to mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques to obscure their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the so-called dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

As the technologies lower people’s inhibitions, online groups are sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Illinois who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Lawmakers foresaw the crisis years ago, but enforcement has fallen short

Congress passed a landmark law in 2008 that foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation. Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. And although a senior executive-level official was to oversee the federal response at the Justice Department, that has not happened.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Stacie B. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

Law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up

With so many reports of the images coming their way, police departments across the country are besieged. Some have managed their workload by focusing efforts on imagery depicting the youngest, most vulnerable victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

About one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section is assigned to child sexual exploitation cases, officials said, a clear indication of how big the problem is.

“We could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,” said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville."

Online predators create and share the illegal material, which is increasingly cloaked by technology. Tech companies, the government and the authorities are no match.

The images are horrific. Children, some just 3 or 4 years old, being sexually abused and in some cases tortured.

Pictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared to satisfy twisted adult obsessions. But it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.

More than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than a million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.

Yet the explosion in detected content kept growing — exponentially.

Exploited Articles in this series examine the explosion in online photos and videos of children being sexually abused. They include graphic descriptions of some instances of the abuse.

An investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. As with hate speech and terrorist propaganda, many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms, or failed to cooperate sufficiently with the authorities when they found it.

Law enforcement agencies devoted to the problem were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.

The Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery — the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities — was ill equipped for the expanding demands.

A paper recently published in conjunction with that group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, described a system at “a breaking point,” with reports of abusive images “exceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.” It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with the criminals.

In 1998, there were over 3,000 reports of child sexual abuse imagery. Just over a decade later, yearly reports soared past 100,000. In 2014, that number surpassed 1 million for the first time. Last year, there were 18.4 million, more than one-third of the total ever reported. Those reports included over 45 million images and videos flagged as child sexual abuse. By Rich Harris | Source: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

The Times reviewed over 10,000 pages of police and court documents; conducted software tests to assess the availability of the imagery through search engines; accompanied detectives on raids; and spoke with investigators, lawmakers, tech executives and government officials. The reporting included conversations with an admitted pedophile who concealed his identity using encryption software and who runs a site that has hosted as many as 17,000 such images.

In interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Children, raped by relatives and strangers alike, being told it was normal. Adults, now years removed from their abuse, still living in fear of being recognized from photos and videos on the internet. And parents of the abused, struggling to cope with the guilt of not having prevented it and their powerlessness over stopping its online spread.

Many of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.

“I don’t really know how to deal with it,” said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. “You’re just trying to feel O.K. and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is — that’s the thing that keeps this alive.”

The Times’s reporting revealed a problem global in scope — most of the images found last year were traced to other countries — but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery’s spread and in reporting it to the authorities.

While the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed the images to multiply at an alarming rate. Both recirculated and new images occupy all corners of the internet, including a range of platforms as diverse as Facebook Messenger, Microsoft’s Bing search engine and the storage service Dropbox.

In a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. In some online forums, children are forced to hold up signs with the name of the group or other identifying information to prove the images are fresh.

To report online child sexual abuse, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.

With so many reports of the abuse coming their way, law enforcement agencies across the country said they were often besieged. Some have managed their online workload by focusing on imagery depicting the youngest victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

In some sense, increased detection of the spiraling problem is a sign of progress. Tech companies are legally required to report images of child abuse only when they discover them; they are not required to look for them.

After years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, stepped up surveillance of their platforms. In interviews, executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.

But police records and emails, as well as interviews with nearly three dozen local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.

And when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to the authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

All the while, criminals continue to trade and stockpile caches of the material.

The law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.

The Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports that are meant to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department’s efforts. The first person to hold the position, Francey Hakes, said it was clear from the outset that no one “felt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.”

The federal government has also not lived up to the law’s funding goals, severely crippling efforts to stamp out the activity.

Congress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement — depleting 40 percent of the units’ discretionary budget until the final month of the fiscal year.

Alicia Kozakiewicz, who was abducted by a man she had met on the internet when she was 13, said the lack of follow-through was disheartening. Now an advocate for laws preventing crimes against children, she had testified in support of the 2008 legislation.

“I remember looking around the room, and there wasn’t a dry eye,” said Ms. Kozakiewicz, 31, who had told of being chained, raped and beaten while her kidnapper live-streamed the abuse on the internet. “The federal bill passed, but it wasn’t funded. So it didn’t mean anything.”

Further impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.

The nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.

“To be honest, it’s a resource and volume issue,” said John Shehan, a vice president at the center, which was established 35 years ago to track missing children. “First priority is making sure we’re assessing the risk of the children. We’re getting this information into the hands of law enforcement.”

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida who was an author of the 2008 law, said in an interview that she was unaware of the extent of the federal government’s failures. After being briefed on The Times’s findings, she sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting an accounting.

Stacie B. Harris, the Justice Department’s coordinator over the past year for combating child exploitation, said the problem was systemic, extending well beyond the department and her tenure there. “We are trying to play catch-up because we know that this is a huge, huge problem,” said Ms. Harris, an associate deputy attorney general.

The fallout for law enforcement, in some instances, has been crushing.

When reviewing tips from the national center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has narrowed its focus to images of infants and toddlers. And about one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section — which deals with all kinds of threats, including terrorism — is now assigned to child sexual exploitation cases.

“We could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,” said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.

The Cutting Edge

The videos found on the computer of an Ohio man were described by investigators as among “the most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.”

One showed a woman orally forcing herself on a girl who was then held upside down by the ankles in a bathroom while “another child urinates” on her face, according to court documents.

Another showed a woman “inserting an ice cube into the vagina” of a young girl, the documents said, before tying her ankles together, taping her mouth shut and suspending her upside down. As the video continued, the girl was beaten, slapped and burned with a match or candle.

“The predominant sound is the child screaming and crying,” according to a federal agent quoted in the documents.

The videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted, one common way abusive imagery has been able to race across the internet with impunity.

Increasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of the police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had over 3 million photos and videos on his computers.

The site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to the court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves. They were known as “producers.”

Multiple police investigations over the past few years have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child’s Play that was reported to have had over a million user accounts.

The highly skilled perpetrators often taunt the authorities with their technical skills, acting boldly because they feel protected by the cover of darkness.

“People who traffic in child exploitation materials are on the cutting edge of technology,” said Susan Hennessey, a former lawyer at the National Security Agency who researches cybersecurity at the Brookings Institution.

Offenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

The anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Exhibits in the case of the Love Zone, sealed by the court but released by a judge after a request by The Times, include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain “safe” while posting and downloading the imagery. Tips included tutorials on how to encrypt and share material without being detected by the authorities.

The offender in Ohio, a site administrator named Jason Gmoser, “went to great lengths to hide” his conduct, according to the documents. Testimony in his criminal case revealed that it would have taken the authorities “trillions of years” to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over to investigators, and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.

The site was run by a number of men, including Brian Davis, a worker at a child day care center in Illinois who admitted to documenting abuse of his own godson and more than a dozen other children — aged 3 months to 8 years — and sharing images of the assaults with other members. Mr. Davis made over 400 posts on the site. One image showed him orally raping a 2-year-old; another depicted a man raping an infant’s anus.

Mr. Davis, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2016, said that “capturing the abuse on video was part of the excitement,” according to court records.

Some of his victims attended the court proceedings and submitted statements about their continuing struggles with the abuse.

‘Truly Terrible Things’

The surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.

The companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way, according to interviews and emails detailing the companies’ activities. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.

Hemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases, said it was clear more than two decades ago that new technologies had created the biggest boon for pedophiles since the Polaroid camera.

The recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse “wouldn’t exist if they did their job then,” said Mr. Nigam, who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm and previously held top security roles at Microsoft, Myspace and News Corporation.

Hany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material, said tech companies had been reluctant for years to dig too deeply.

“The companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,” he said. “And then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.”

Federal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from the authorities to reach companies too late.

“That’s a huge issue for us,” said Capt. Mike Edwards, a Seattle police commander who oversees a cybercrimes unit for the State of Washington. “You’ve got a short period of time to be able to get the data if it was preserved.”

Most tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. In interviews, law enforcement officials pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies.

Police officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin lamented Tumblr’s poor response to requests, with one officer describing the issues as “long-term and ongoing” in an internal document.

A recent investigation in Polk County, Wis., that included an image of a man orally raping a young child stalled for over a year. The investigator retired before Tumblr responded to numerous emails requesting information.

In a 2016 Wisconsin case, Tumblr alerted a person who had uploaded explicit images that the account had been referred to the authorities, a practice that a former employee told The Times had been common for years. The tip allowed the man to destroy evidence on his electronic devices, the police said.

A spokeswoman for Verizon said that Tumblr prioritized time-sensitive cases, which delayed other responses. Since Verizon acquired the company in 2017, the spokeswoman said, its practice was not to alert users of police requests for data. Verizon recently sold Tumblr to the web development company Automattic.

The law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft’s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat.

Bing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult, if not impossible. Snapchat, a platform especially popular with young people, is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time. According to law enforcement, when requests are made to the company, Snap often replies that it has no additional information.

A Microsoft spokesman said that the company had only limited information about offenders using the search engine, and that it was cooperating as best as it could. A Snap spokesman said the company preserved data in compliance with the law.

Data obtained through a public records request suggests Facebook’s plans to encrypt Messenger in the coming years will lead to vast numbers of images of child abuse going undetected. The data shows that WhatsApp, the company’s encrypted messaging app, submits only a small fraction of the reports Messenger does.

Facebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for “truly terrible things like child exploitation.”

“Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy,” he said, “but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.”

‘Vastly Inadequate’

“In a recent case, an offender filmed himself drugging the juice boxes of neighborhood children before tricking them into drinking the mix,” said Special Agent Flint Waters, a criminal investigator for the State of Wyoming. “He then filmed himself as he sexually abused unconscious children.”

Mr. Waters, appearing before Congress in Washington, was describing what he said “we see every day.”

He went on to present a map of the United States covered with red dots, each representing a computer used to share images of child sex abuse. Fewer than two percent of the crimes would be investigated, he predicted. “We are overwhelmed, we are underfunded and we are drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy,” he said.

Mr. Waters’s testimony was delivered 12 years ago — in 2007.

The following year, Congress passed legislation that acknowledged the severity of the crisis. But then the federal government largely moved on. Some of the strongest provisions of the law were not fulfilled, and many problems went unfixed, according to interviews and government documents.

Today, Mr. Waters’s testimony offers a haunting reminder of time lost.

Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut who was a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, the biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. Even the most recent of the two reports that were published, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as the trade in illicit imagery.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Ms. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

When the law was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position with broad authority. That has not happened. “This is supposed to be the quarterback,” said Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of the provision’s authors.

Even when the Justice Department has been publicly called out for ignoring provisions of the law, there has been little change.

In 2011, the Government Accountability Office reported that no steps had been taken to research which online offenders posed a high risk to children, and that the Justice Department had not submitted a progress assessment to Congress, both requirements of the law.

At the time, the department said it did not have enough funding to undertake the research and had no “time frame” for submitting a report. Today, the provisions remain largely unfulfilled.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which testified in favor of the 2008 law, has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.

Founded in 1984 after the well-publicized kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old Florida boy, Adam Walsh, the center has been closely affiliated with the federal government since the Reagan administration.

But as child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998, nearly a decade before the first iPhone was released. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.

The center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don’t stop there. The police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely.

“We’re spending a tremendous amount of time having to go through those and reanalyze them ourselves,” said Captain Edwards, the Seattle police official.

In a statement, the national center said it did its best to route reports to the correct jurisdiction.

Despite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency. It repeatedly denied requests from The Times for quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Justice Department, as well as for tallies of imagery reports submitted by individual tech companies.

Mr. Shehan, the vice president, said such disclosures might discourage tech companies from cooperating with the center. He said the numbers could be misinterpreted.

The Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about good governance practices. For example, the center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. Google alone has donated nearly $4 million in the past decade, according to public testimony.

A spokeswoman for the center said it was common to expect corporations to provide financial assistance to charities. But the practice, others working in the area of child protection say, could elevate the interests of the tech companies above the children’s.

“There’s an inherent conflict in accepting money from these companies when they also sit on your board,” said Signy Arnason, who is a top executive at the equivalent organization in Canada, known as the Canadian Center for Child Protection.

This close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.

If that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates and how tech companies find and remove illegal imagery on their platforms. Under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, the companies fear, they could also be viewed as government actors, not private entities, subjecting them to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.

An Ugly Mirror

It was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house. Garden gnomes and a heart-shaped “Welcome Friends” sign decorated the front yard.

At the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated in a cramped interrogation area, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers.

The man had shared sexually explicit videos online, the police said, including one of a 10-year-old boy being “orally sodomized” by a man, and another of a man forcing two young boys to engage in anal intercourse.

“The sad thing is that’s pretty tame compared to what we’ve seen,” said Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general’s office who led a raid of the house. The victims have not been identified or rescued.

The year was barely half over, and Chief Farnsworth’s team had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates state and regional responses to internet crimes against children.

The Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year for crimes related to child sexual abuse material, but federal funding has not kept pace with the surge. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400 percent.

Much of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.

“I thought that I was in the underbelly of society — until I came here,” said Ms. Lippert, the prosecutor with the task force in Illinois, who had worked for years at a busy Chicago courthouse.

While any child at imminent risk remains a priority, the volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations, including infiltrating chat rooms and online forums.

“I think some of the bigger fish who are out there are staying out there,” Ms. Lippert said.

The internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action.

But the problem of child sexual abuse imagery faces a particular hurdle: It gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content, or they wrongly dismiss it as primarily teenagers sending inappropriate selfies.

Some state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings when it was on the agenda, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.

Steven J. Grocki, who leads a group of policy experts and lawyers at the child exploitation section of the Justice Department, said the reluctance to address the issue went beyond elected officials and was a societal problem. “They turn away from it because it’s too ugly of a mirror,” he said.

Yet the material is everywhere, and ever more available.

“I think that people were always there, but the access is so easy,” said Lt. John Pizzuro, a task force commander in New Jersey. “You got nine million people in the state of New Jersey. Based upon statistics, we can probably arrest 400,000 people.”

Common language about the abuse can also minimize the harm in people’s minds. While the imagery is often defined as “child pornography” in state and federal laws, experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography, which is legal for people over 18.

“Each and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,” said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. “The violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.”"
26,"By Perri Klass, M.D","The experts who study parenting are interested in how we spend those moments.

Rebecca Ryan, a professor of psychology at Georgetown, who was a co-author on that study, said that with children 3 to 5 years old, college-educated mothers spent on average 14 minutes a day in teaching activities, whereas mothers with a high school degree or less spend about five minutes a day. So the individual amounts are relatively small, but when you multiply those differences out across the endless (or all-too-short) days of child rearing, they can be profound.

“Whatever the myth of hyperparenting is, there is basically no parent who spends two hours a day reading or doing puzzles,” Dr. Kalil said. “The average amount of time parents spend a day is between 20 and 30 minutes.”

And the biggest difference is between parents who don’t do any of those developmentally stimulating activities and parents who do something, she said, which is why the focus of parenting programs and interventions should be to get parents to put in some minutes — not hours — on a regular basis. “What I believe is that what really matters is regular steady habits of modest investment,” she said.

And yes, the parents in the zero-minutes-a-day group are disproportionately low-income and less well educated, though there are certainly plenty of low-income families where lots of reading and talking and involvement goes on. For those at zero, “to shift the needle on moving them closer to what middle class or rich parents do does not mean asking them to read an hour a night,” Dr. Kalil said. “It means reducing the number of days when nothing happens.”

Dr. Kalil directs the center for human potential and public policy, where she studies low-income families. “We’ve interviewed thousands of low-income parents in Chicago,” she said. “They know reading is important, they have books in their house, but for a variety of reasons, because life in low-income circumstances is more stressful and more unpredictable, low-income families have a harder time following through on these aspirations.”

By working with text message reminders, she said, parents can set goals for what they want to do with their children. In another study, these behavioral tools more than doubled the amount of time parents spent engaging with their children."

“Let’s have some real talk,” Ms. Harris said in Reno. “This is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I’ve heard every time I’ve ran a campaign and — here’s the operative word — won.”

In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates — such as South Carolina, Nevada and California, her home state — while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.

It was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama’s successful playbook in 2008.

But after the fleeting high of Ms. Harris’s much-talked-about exchange with Mr. Biden over segregation and school busing in the first Democratic debate, it became clear that several assumptions underpinning that national strategy were not in line with the current moment.

Mr. Biden’s support soon bounced back, fueled by perceptions that he was best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, which remains the obsessive top priority for most Democratic voters. Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been particularly difficult for Ms. Harris to match, and some of her own supporters from within the Congressional Black Caucus told her privately they felt the debate moment had crossed a line.

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

In this race’s early stages, Ms. Harris showed all the signs of a possible coalition candidate, merging liberals and more moderate minority voters behind the strength of her historic bid to become the country’s first woman of color elected president. On the race’s first day, she raised $1.5 million, and she soon held a kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif., that remains one of the largest events for any candidate, with more than 20,000 people in attendance.

However, as the race has matured, Ms. Harris has been outflanked in money and ideology. Mr. Buttigieg has become the favorite of big money donors, and advisers for Mr. Biden, the race’s most prominent moderate candidate, are now considering a super PAC to supplement his coffers.

On the grass-roots side, progressives have centralized behind their two preferred candidates: Mr. Sanders, who retains many supporters from his previous presidential run, and Ms. Warren, who has grown her fund-raising base as her poll numbers have risen. She has outpaced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in recent polls, both nationally and in a few early-voting states.

Ms. Harris’s team is adamant that she remains well-positioned — and adequately funded — to mount a vigorous operation in Iowa. As Mr. Biden’s poll numbers fade, Ms. Harris’s advisers believe her campaign is likely to gain from this and can use a strong initial showing to centralize black voters in later states. Recently, Ms. Harris shook up her senior staff, in a move that was first reported by Politico, and was taken as an acknowledgment of the campaign’s tough road ahead."

Officials said that the various Trump-related committees have raised a combined $308 million this year, and have $156 million in cash on hand.

The numbers were reported by The Associated Press, and a campaign official confirmed their accuracy."

The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather.

Kissing babies and tousling children’s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops . In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning."

In a moment marked by fractured politics, Ms. Gabbard’s nontraditional positions are a major part of her appeal for voters seeking to break out of polarized partisan divisions. Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, said he planned to vote for her. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, donated to her campaign.

But it’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

Some of those who have worked with Ms. Gabbard say that, as an Iraq war veteran whose chief message is that America should stop trying to police the world, she is representing viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad .

“In reality, Tulsi is really running on an antiwar message that’s consistent with where a lot of veterans are,” said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal veterans organization VoteVets.org, which worked closely with Ms. Gabbard during her first congressional campaign. “I know everyone thinks there’s a conspiracy theory here but that’s really what she’s doing.”

Still, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election and the D.N.C. is well aware of the frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard in the Russian state news media.

But when Ms. Warren looked out at the audience, she saw mostly white faces. The view reflected perhaps her biggest political challenge as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination: adding black voters to her base of support.

African-Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.

The deep middle of the field beckoned. The Dolphins showed five players at the line but rushed three, dropping eight into coverage. Brown zoomed past defenders on a post route, then toward a vast expanse of green. Jackson flicked his wrist and lofted the ball 45 yards. Brown caught it in stride and dashed into the end zone.

From the Ravens’ perspective, how the play happened was more exciting than the score itself.

“We just hadn’t seen anything like that from him,” the Ravens’ offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, said, referring to Jackson. “It was the coverage read, but it was also just great downfield accuracy.”

That play differed dramatically from those Jackson piloted last season. When he was elevated to the starter midway through the season, coaches thrust him into a rush-heavy offense, the better to optimize his supersonic speed and cheat-code jukes, his most salient qualities. Jackson ended up throwing for one more touchdown than he ran in himself (five). That style helped power the team to a division title, but it wasn’t the long-term plan for the Ravens — or Jackson."

Most of the Democratic candidates have proposed some form of subsidized child care or public preschool, and some say that a corresponding subsidy for at-home caregivers would allow parents to choose who cares for their children. (President Trump made a similar proposal when he was running for president, but did not include it in his tax plan.)

But they’re also acknowledging something else: Often, staying home is not really a choice at all. If parents’ jobs are too inflexible to accommodate children’s needs, or pay too little to afford child care, taking care of their child has to come first.

As long as people have debated the idea, there has been disagreement over whether paying women for unpaid labor is liberating or oppressive.

In the United States in the late 1800s, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the writer and social reformer, wrote that unpaid labor took away women’s independence and ought to be done by paid experts. Around the same time, the United States for a period paid single mothers a pension, on the belief that it was best for children if mothers did not work outside the home (though black women were largely excluded).

The idea resurfaced during the feminist movement of the 1970s. That period is well known for the rush of women into the work force. But there was a parallel movement, which began in Europe and spread to the United States: wages for housework. The argument was that women should be paid for the work they were already doing, and that men’s paid work depended on it, as Louise Toupin described in a history of the movement last year.

Similar debates continue today in countries that pay a child allowance. In Finland, for example, the policy is seen as giving women “freedom to choose,” while in Sweden, it has been called a “trap for women.” (The policies are usually gender-neutral, but it’s mostly women who use them.)"

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

“My daughter is marrying an Asian man and diversity has become very important to me,” said Julie Neff, a 57-year-old Iowa Democrat who attended the Harris rally. Ms. Neff, who is white, said she was embarrassed that she started thinking about race and discrimination only later in life."

The independent board will judge appeals from users on material that has been taken down from the platform by the company, and it will review policy decisions that the company has submitted to the board.

It’s much needed. It’s hard to miss the rising dissatisfaction and frustration with Facebook. Users, regulators, politicians and the media have had enough with how it has evolved and how the co-creator and chief executive, Mr. Zuckerberg, has been responding to the many problems that seem to pop up daily.

Last week, we saw yet another controversy over the company’s year-old policy to exempt politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to lie in paid advertisements.

People sometimes ask how I stay optimistic when I cover war, genocide and poverty. The answer is simple: Side by side with the worst of humanity, you encounter the best. I’ve made repeated trips to the rebel-held Nuba Mountains of Sudan, where the government dropped bombs and starved villagers, and there I met an extraordinary human being, Dr. Tom Catena, who has devoted his life to providing medical care as the bombs fall around him. A Muslim paramount chief told me that “Dr. Tom,” as he is known, heals the sick and lets the lame walk — and thus “He’s Jesus Christ.” On one trip to the Nuba Mountains, I was sickened to visit an extended family that had lost six children to a bomb but also moved that Dr. Tom had managed to save three others. So I return from a war zone like that scarred by the pain I’ve witnessed, but also uplifted by the goodness, strength and decency shown by people like Dr. Tom — and actually feeling better about humanity.

5 Minutes, $25 and a New Life

Another reason for optimism: I have seen immense progress in my 35 years of covering the world. On my first travels to poor countries, as a law student, I was pained by the number of blind people I saw led around by their children or grandchildren. Many were blind from cataracts, and in 2015 I met a remarkable Nepali doctor, Sanduk Ruit, who has pioneered a way to perform five-minute cataract surgery without electricity or advanced facilities for only $25 a patient. He has personally performed more than 120,000 cataract surgeries. You cannot watch Dr. Ruit’s patients take off their bandages and smile giddily as they see clearly for the first time in many years without feeling a rush of warmth about our world.

An Innocent Man Facing Death?

Beginning in 2010, I wrote a number of times about a black man named Kevin Cooper who I believe was framed for murder by the San Bernardino County sheriff’s office in California, where he is now on death row. The articles didn’t get much traction or readership, but the more I reported on the subject the more aware I became that there are many people on death row after dubious convictions. So last year, with the help of Times colleagues who are experts in visual journalism, I conducted a thorough investigation of the Cooper case and published the results. We called on the authorities to allow advanced DNA testing in the case (Kamala Harris and Jerry Brown had previously refused to allow the testing). It may have been the longest opinion column The Times ever published. The upshot is that advanced DNA testing is now finally underway, and I’m praying that after 36 years in prison Cooper may finally get justice — along with those who framed him. Here’s the investigation.

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden.

But she should not have been surprised.

For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for “big structural change” took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren’s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all.

This time, Mr. O’Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump’s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was “being vague” in campaign proposals.

This was Ms. Warren’s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. “A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point."

Triathlon has become the first national governing body of an American sport to make a sponsorship deal with a company that sells products containing cannabidiol, or CBD.

CBD is a nonintoxicating compound that, like the intoxicating compound THC, is found in varying amounts in hemp, a legal cannabis plant. In 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency removed CBD from its list of banned substances. THC and scores of other cannabinoids remain on the banned list, but by removing CBD, WADA opened the door for elite athletes to use and endorse CBD products.

CBD’s benefits are said to include preventing pain and inflammation, relieving stress and anxiety and even aiding digestion. CBD products are available in several forms, including oils and lotions .

The financial terms of the four-year deal between U.S.A. Triathlon and Pure Spectrum, which is based in Colorado, were not disclosed. It came less than a year after Congress passed the Farm Bill , which legalized hemp . Growing the plant had been against federal law for many years.

Ms. Gabbard’s warnings of a rigged election are likely to resonate with her base, an unconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, contrarian culture-war skeptics, white nationalists and conspiracy theorists.

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president?

In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president.

They’re right: There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China on his behalf, as President Trump has falsely claimed."

Voters Who Want to Like Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/democrats-debate-republicans.html,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

The detentions come as tensions grow between China and the United States over trade and other issues, but Mr. Geng, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Thursday that he did not see a “specific correlation” between the two.

But recent detentions of Americans have raised concerns. In June, a Koch Industries executive was held in southern China and interrogated for several days before being allowed to leave the country. Last month, a FedEx pilot was detained on charges of weapons smuggling. Though he was quickly released on bail, he remains under investigation and has not been allowed to leave the country.

In January, the State Department issued a travel advisory for China, warning Americans, particularly those with dual Chinese-American citizenship, that they may be prevented from leaving China if they go there.

The large network of English teachers in China, long a mainstay of the expatriate scene, appears to have come under particular scrutiny. For years, many education companies operating in China were known to have dabbled in a legal gray area, as the authorities often looked the other way.

Reports were widespread of foreign teachers working in China without proper visas. According to official estimates, while China had around 400,000 foreign citizens working in its education industry in 2017, only one-third had a valid work permit. Some schools, in turn, exploited that vulnerability, in some instances by withholding wages."

During the Q & A following a screening of “Blindspotting” — a movie that engages with police brutality against black people, systemic racial inequalities and gentrification — an older white woman in the audience asked the director if he was “afraid” while they were filming on location in Oakland, Calif. Instantly and jarringly, I was reminded of my other-ness within the room.

At a press screening of Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave” several years ago, I sat through the dramatized depiction of the life of the slave Solomon Northup, in all of its austere, made-for-the-Oscars glory. After sitting through the subjugation of several black characters, especially Lupita Nyong’o’s Patsy, who is raped onscreen by her master and later suffers an excruciatingly unflinching whipping, I was emotionally drained by the weight of the horrors that had been depicted onscreen.

As the mostly white audience trickled out of the theater at the end, I overheard a man expressing relief to his companion: “I couldn’t last 12 minutes of all that, never mind 12 years!”

During the Black Out performance of “Slave Play,” I was shielded from having to endure such gross remarks for a couple of hours. Sure, it was awkward to see Kaneisha twerk to a Rihanna song in Mammy-ish garb for her white husband, who was dressed as a plantation overseer. Watching the researchers conducting the retreat (an interracial lesbian couple) lead the black participants in unpacking their resentment, anger and irritation toward their white partners was discomforting. (It also resurfaced many emotions based on my own past experiences with white romantic partners.) And it was difficult to sit with the play’s final moments, which involve a sexually violent and emotional catharsis.

But that night there seemed to be a fellowship among everyone, as people collectively gasped, provided audible ad-libs (“She’s crazy!” someone exclaimed, referring to the extremely oblivious and frequent interrupter Alana) and erupted into laughter or applause at some of the more outlandish or scabrous moments. If we all interpreted and felt about it differently, it still meant something to have the relief of freedom from judgment to express those responses.

There were fewer of us the second time I saw “Slave Play,” during one of the final preview showings last week. The audience was mostly white, and, unsurprisingly, that sense of community didn’t have quite the same power as it did during the Black Out. The audience was much more muted, though some of the show’s most pivotal moments and biggest comedic beats garnered similarly audible reactions.

It probably helped that I already knew what I was in for, but the experience wasn’t as uncomfortable as I thought it might be. It also doesn’t hurt that Harris’s script is clear in its intentions: The entire point of the therapy, and the reason the black characters desire to role-play antebellum fantasies, is because they want their partners to acknowledge their whiteness and the role racism plays in their every day lives."

Instead, she turned the discussion back toward antitrust and campaign finance laws, repeating that she had vowed not to take money from many corporate interests.

Here is a transcript of the exchange:

HARRIS: Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump’s account, that you did not agree. And I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. And he and his account should be taken down.

In addition to providing a ratings boon, an emphasis on politics wins accolades. HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,” a show that is as much journalism as it is comedy, has won the Emmy for outstanding variety talk series four years in a row. And with the 2020 campaign heating up, the presidential candidates Joseph R. Biden Jr., Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have all made the late-night rounds.

“If you’re a candidate now and you’re not on one of these shows or discussed by one of these hosts, you are not alive,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic political consultant.

Hollywood stars are still staples of late night. “If I could have Tom Hanks every night, I would get him,” Mr. Licht said. Will Smith scored 3.9 million viewers for his recent appearance on Mr. Colbert’s show, and James Corden, the host of CBS’s “The Late Late Show,” has lately led the 12:30 a.m. time slot in total viewers with a program that often has the feel of a celebrity clubhouse.

But Mr. Corden’s rival Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night With Seth Meyers, ” drew more total viewers in the 2018-19 season thanks to a formula that had him devoting the first 20 minutes of his show to the latest on Mr. Trump. Mr. Meyers also led among adult viewers under 50 last season, and he remains the leader among that segment of the audience.

In this supercharged news environment, anchors like Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, both of Fox News, have been late-night guests, as have the CBS News stalwarts Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell. When Ms. King and Ms. O’Donnell were the lead guests on Mr. Colbert’s live show after the State of the Union address in February, they drew an audience of 4.6 million.

Jay Sures, a co-president of the United Talent Agency, which represents many news anchors, said he had noticed a spike in bookings for his clients. “They’ve unintentionally become celebrities based on how the news business has become part of our daily routine in a way it never has before,” he said. “The Trump era has elevated news.”"

This is a political process. And they’re leaning heavily into that idea with the eight-page letter the White House counsel sent tonight. We also see that in the polls: How people view Trump’s actions and the actions of House Democrats is split by party.

We also already know how this story almost certainly ends : Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House’s, calculation is: no.

But isn’t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats’ belief that there’s some kind of cover-up?

Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they’re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided — really late at night — that their position was about something broader.

Remember when they decided to release the transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president? In that case, they clearly made the opposite calculation: Looking like we’re hiding something is worse than the facts in the transcript, which were pretty bad. Now, they’ve basically decided that looking like they’re hiding something is better than looking like they’re cooperating with what they’re calling an illegitimate investigation. House Democrats have only had one witness so far, Kurt Volker, and look how much House Democrats got! They have in writing that there could have been a quid pro quo. What else could they find with even just one more?"

Rebecca Ryan, a professor of psychology at Georgetown, who was a co-author on that study, said that with children 3 to 5 years old, college-educated mothers spent on average 14 minutes a day in teaching activities, whereas mothers with a high school degree or less spend about five minutes a day. So the individual amounts are relatively small, but when you multiply those differences out across the endless (or all-too-short) days of child rearing, they can be profound.

“Whatever the myth of hyperparenting is, there is basically no parent who spends two hours a day reading or doing puzzles,” Dr. Kalil said. “The average amount of time parents spend a day is between 20 and 30 minutes.”

And the biggest difference is between parents who don’t do any of those developmentally stimulating activities and parents who do something, she said, which is why the focus of parenting programs and interventions should be to get parents to put in some minutes — not hours — on a regular basis. “What I believe is that what really matters is regular steady habits of modest investment,” she said.

And yes, the parents in the zero-minutes-a-day group are disproportionately low-income and less well educated, though there are certainly plenty of low-income families where lots of reading and talking and involvement goes on. For those at zero, “to shift the needle on moving them closer to what middle class or rich parents do does not mean asking them to read an hour a night,” Dr. Kalil said. “It means reducing the number of days when nothing happens.”

Dr. Kalil directs the center for human potential and public policy, where she studies low-income families. “We’ve interviewed thousands of low-income parents in Chicago,” she said. “They know reading is important, they have books in their house, but for a variety of reasons, because life in low-income circumstances is more stressful and more unpredictable, low-income families have a harder time following through on these aspirations.”

By working with text message reminders, she said, parents can set goals for what they want to do with their children. In another study, these behavioral tools more than doubled the amount of time parents spent engaging with their children."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

The targeted audience for this Biden ad on Medicare was overwhelmingly women 65 or older. Source: Facebook

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

An ad about Julian Castro’s pet euthanasia policy was shown mostly to women. Source: Facebook

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

An ad with Ms. Gabbard describing her foreign policy while standing in front of an American flag was disproportionately shown to men. Source: Facebook

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

I used to think calling cars “death machines” was kind of extreme. Then my niece was hit by one.

She was only 9 years old, out with her family in Los Angeles and running toward an ice cream truck. She was hit with such force that most of her front teeth were knocked out. She is lucky to be alive.

Thinking about my niece made me recall all the other times members of my family had been injured by cars. My husband’s grandmother was killed. My aunt and uncle were seriously injured. I was even involved in a hit-and-run in a crosswalk in front of my school when I was a kid and broke my leg.

Most of us have stories like this — a car coming into our lives and unleashing horrendous damage on our loved ones, friends, family and even ourselves.

Cars are death machines. Pedestrian fatalities in the United States have increased 41 percent since 2008; more than 6,000 pedestrians were killed in 2018 alone. More than 4,000 American kids are killed in car crashes every year – I am thankful every day my niece wasn’t one of them.

Here’s the thing: Statistics clearly don’t seem to persuade anyone of the magnitude of this problem. Not policy makers or automakers, technologists or drivers.

If numbers don’t change minds, can personal experiences?

I conducted an experiment on Twitter this summer, asking people to share my tweet if a car had hit them, or anyone they knew. It was shared thousands of times and more than 500 people shared stories of being hit, losing family and friends, and sustaining injuries that impact their daily lives.

A driver bolted toward traffic without stopping at the stop sign. He hit me broadside, sending me into traffic that was thankfully empty at the moment. The next thing I remember was being helped onto the grass with my bent-up bike and someone asking me where I lived. I was in 5th grade at the time. That's only one of three stories I have. Alexandra Watson, Boulder, CO Nick Cote for The New York Times I was hit by a car when I was 15. Riding a bike down a street near my house, a car turned left in front of me. I survived only because the hood was low and broad enough that I catapulted over it rather than impacting the side. Skip Pile A truck pulled up alongside me at a red light. When the light turned green, I started going, but was whacked on the back of my head by a side mirror (I think), was sent into the right lane, bounced off the side, and, still fighting to keep upright, finally fell — under the moving gravel truck. I ended up with a broken pelvis and an education in how judges assign liability. Dan Turner, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times I was “doored” by a car twice and hit in a crosswalk — all on bikes. Don’t tell my mom. Molly Cohen I was hit by cars while on a bike three times in two years in L.A. Two right-hooks, one road-raged me into a row of parked cars. Hit once on San Pablo in Oakland: a thrown-open door that I bent all the way back and flipped over the top. He demanded I pay to repair his car door and threatened to get his gun before he ran. Christopher Kidd, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times

There are many who say that autonomous or smart cars will solve this. So far, I’m unpersuaded. Since 2014, over $80 billion dollars has been spent on “smart” or connected cars (more on these in a minute) and autonomous vehicles, arguably to make cars safer. But investing in the car of the future is investing in the wrong problem. We need to be thinking about how we can create a world with fewer cars.

Among the safety measures proposed by car companies are encouraging pedestrians and bicyclists to use R.F.I.D. tags, which emit signals that cars can detect. This means it’s becoming the pedestrian’s responsibility to avoid getting hit. But if keeping people safe means putting the responsibility on them (or worse, criminalizing walking and biking), we need to think twice about the technology we’re developing.

This may be the worst outcome of the automobile-centered 20th century: the assumption that it’s people who need to get out of the way of these lethal machines, instead of the other way around.

I was biking in the street after work when a car pulled out of a parking garage without looking and clipped my back tire. I went down, but fortunately only did some deep tissue damage that healed in a week. My bike tires were pretty bent and had to be replaced; I was a lucky one. J. R. Raith I was hit by a car in July 2017 in San Francisco. I was getting out of an Uber and the driver, who just dropped me off, backed over me as I waited to cross the street. Danny Harris, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times Two years ago, a drunk driver ran over me with his pickup truck. He kept going — hit and run. No one on the scene thought I'd make it. The doctors didn't believe I'd make it. I had skull fractures, a broken jaw in three places and wired shut, a punched lung with added tracheotomy. I was in a coma for a week, and woke up alone. Ryan Cary Wear I was hit by a car when I was 11, in Queens. I was knocked to the ground, but otherwise unhurt because the car was moving slowly. The driver got out and made sure I was O.K. before leaving. Three of my friends (one pedestrian and two cyclists, all adults) were killed by cars. Lauren Weinberg, Waterloo, Ontario Tara Walton for The New York Times

Many so-called advances in car design may, thus far, be making things much worse. The internet-equipped “connected car,” for example, initially introduced by Cadillac in 1996 as a luxury safety feature known as OnStar, has morphed into something else entirely. Increasingly large and complicated dashboard screens take cognitive resources away from the task at hand, which is driving, and have the potential to be as dangerous as texting while driving.

Just as all these interested parties scramble to make cars more technologically complex, they’ve gone all-in on making them bigger, much bigger. Americans are buying — and car manufacturers are producing — more S.U.V.s than ever before, a shift that has led to a 69 percent increase in pedestrian fatalities, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.

Because the front end of an S.U.V. is higher than the average car’s front end, it is far more likely to hit a pedestrian in the chest or head and twice as likely to kill walkers, runners, cyclists and children, compared to regular cars. And yet, S.U.V. sales account for 60 percent of new vehicle sales.

One of the easiest ways to make cars safer would be to make them smaller. Another way? Figuring out how to get people to drive less by providing safer, more sustainable alternatives to the car.

I’m not so naïve to think we can get rid of cars altogether, but we have so many tools to eliminate traffic-related injuries and fatalities right now. Banning all passenger auto-driving vehicles above a certain weight and front grill height would be a great start. Other solutions run the gamut from the quick and easy fixes — like reducing speed limits, eliminating right turns on red, building protected bike lanes and instituting congestion pricing — to major and necessary commitments like funding new transit projects (upgrading, maintaining and expanding existing transit systems) and rethinking land use to encourage walkable development rather than sprawl.

We can all commit to driving less, which reduces both CO2 emissions and the potential for crashes. We need to be as defensive about crosswalks and bike lanes as drivers are about their cars (and where we believe we are entitled to park them).

Until then, the streets will belong to the death machines."

Most of the buzz surrounding the release over the weekend of the latest gold-standard Iowa poll from Ann Selzer (for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom) involved the candidates who have long been at the top of the heap. In particular, Selzer showed Elizabeth Warren (22 percent) moving ahead of Joe Biden (20 percent), and having double the level of support as third-place Bernie Sanders (11 percent). No other candidate was in double figures, and fourth-placed Pete Buttigieg (9 percent) lost six points since the last Iowa poll in June. So the bottom line was continued churn among the Big Three, with Warren showing the most momentum, but with not much shaking lower on the long list of candidates.

But Selzer also compiled favorable/unfavorable ratios for the candidates, and a look at them may help to discern which of today’s bottom-feeders have true dark horse potential, and which are probably going nowhere fast. Nine active candidates have positive net favorability numbers among likely caucus-goers:

Warren +58 Buttigieg +56 Harris +39 Booker +38 Biden +37 Klobuchar +30 O’Rourke +28 Sanders +22 Yang +6

But nine others are underwater:

Castro -1 Bennet -3 Bullock -5 Gabbard -5 Steyer -5 Sestak -14 Ryan -15 Delaney -17 Williamson -39

Two of the candidates with net negative favorability ratings (Castro and Steyer) have qualified for the October debates, and one other (Gabbard) is one qualifying poll away from making the stage with eight days left before the deadline.

Yes, this is just one poll from one state, albeit a highly regarded poll from the single-most important state, but it provides some evidence that below the Big Three are five who are making enough of a positive impression on Iowa Democrats that a late surge isn’t at all out of the question. And actually, all of the those five have higher net favorability numbers than Bernie Sanders, which increases the bad news he got from Selzer.

Not many pollsters offer favorability/unfavorability ratings for the entire field, but one national tracking poll that does, Morning Consult, offers a somewhat different take, from findings collected just after the September debate. It shows only one candidate, Marianne Williamson, having an underwater favorability ratio (-6). Here’s the rest of the field (Morning Consult didn’t bother to poll Joe Sestak):

Sanders +59 Biden +54 Warren +52 Harris +38 Buttigieg +33 O’Rourke +31 Booker +30 Yang +22 Klobuchar +21 Castro +11 Gabbard +11 Steyer +8 Bennet +6 Bullock +6 Delaney +3 Ryan +1

The rankings are pretty similar, with the exception of a big difference of opinion over Bernie Sanders (the most popular candidate nationally, per MC, but only the eighth most popular in Iowa, per Selzer), and some less dramatic divergences over candidates in the middle of the pack like Yang and Klobuchar (much more popular, unsurprisingly, in next-door Iowa).

At this point you’d have to figure October-debate non-qualifiers Bennet, Bullock, Delaney, Ryan, and Sestak are pretty toasty, with possible qualifier Gabbard and qualifiers Castro and Steyer not looking so hot, either. Yang’s on the bubble, as is Klobuchar, though her relative strength in Iowa could keep her aloft. But if you’re looking for a dark horse at this point, it’s probably going to be from the group that includes Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, and O’Rourke. So in your mental road-map of the race you should probably add a Little Four to the Big Three. And if Cory Booker’s campaign isn’t bluffing in its recent distress signal about fundraising, the list of plausible dark horses could soon shrink further."

With just over a week to go before qualifying ends for the fourth Democratic presidential candidate debate, to be held in October, the Democratic National Committee has announced new, higher qualifications for its November debate (place and time still TBD). Since every candidate who qualified for the September event in Houston automatically made the cut for October, this could be the first “winnowing” measure in a good while.

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states. While the new thresholds could distort fundraising efforts for more marginal candidates, it’s unlikely any of those on the October stage will fall off in November because of fundraising — unless they just run out of money and drop out of the race (as Cory Booker’s campaign has said might happen to him if it doesn’t reach its third-quarter money goals).

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems. There have been only three qualifying debates so far: two national surveys (NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Fox News) and one from Iowa (Ann Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom). Booker has met the new threshold in two of them; Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and Andrew Yang have met it in one. October debate qualifier Tom Steyer and possible qualifier Tulsi Gabbard haven’t met any so far; nor have the other candidates who failed to qualify for September.

The new higher but narrower qualifying option for early-state polls is probably tailor-made for Steyer, who can just pick a state or two and spend tens of millions of dollars on ads there. It could also help Klobuchar, who’s predictably doing better in Iowa than she is nationally or in other early states.

All in all, the new qualifying thresholds are mostly of interest to those who are shrieking in anguish at the likely reappearance of a second debate night in October. The odds are reasonably good that at least one or two October qualifiers won’t make it past the higher thresholds and will put the debate stage far beyond reach of the bottom-feeders who stubbornly refuse to drop out. Maybe for its next debate, in December, the DNC could help us out by administering a lie-detector test to see which candidates really believe they have a prayer of finishing in the top six or so in Iowa."

While she has touted her education at Howard University and raised her experience being bused to school as a young girl, her presidential campaign has stressed universality and inclusion. Her “3 a.m. agenda"" has stressed that what keeps us up at night — medical bills, housing, our kids’ education — does not depend on whether one is a Republican or Democrat. She routinely states that “we have so much more in common than what separates us.”

That reticence, by necessity, has receded. Voters demand a level of candor and intimacy from their presidential candidates. To both define her message and defend her record, she has had to explain her tenure as a prosecutor and rebutted claims that she was a cog in the machine of mass incarceration. She’s been obliged to share stories of her experience as a prosecutor comforting mothers whose children have been shot and killed and in instituting anti-bias training for police officers.

Moreover, as the campaign has progressed, Harris has more overtly emphasized her connection to the African American community and posited herself as African Americans’ advocate in the halls of power. This was especially noticeable in her speech Saturday. She spoke of herself as standing on the shoulders of African American giants such as Thurgood Marshall and told the crowd, “We need soldiers in every phase, layer and trench of the movement for social justice.” There is a need to pair outside advocacy with the hard and “frustrating” work of insiders, she argued. To sustain change and promote progress, she said, “We must elect and lift up people to lead who are also immersed in our community, who represent us and our experience, and who know the deep flaws within the systems we serve.” She added, “We need to run into the fire … extinguisher in hand.” In short, it matters for black Americans to have black Americans in power, on the inside.

Who better to knock down “the systemic barriers to racism,” she posits, than someone who understands that system but also has a deep understanding of the challenges facing the African American community as only a member of that community can? We now see her make the explicit case that the outcomes she obtained — e.g., getting jobs for young, low-level drug offenders — were a reflection of her understanding and attachment to the African American community.

For Harris, the address marked a level of candor and earnestness about her identity as an accomplished, African American woman that we have not regularly seen on the trail. In a time of “overt racism,” she presented herself “as only the second black woman elected to the United States Senate and as a serious and top-tier candidate for the president of the United States.”

One can be cynical and say she is more vividly identifying as an African American candidate with an eye toward the critical South Carolina primary and the need to win over African American voters who heavily favor former vice president Joe Biden. However, it would be foolish for Harris to ignore her own identity, her own career and her own experience as she asks voters to take a chance on a first-time candidate for president, a woman still in her first term in the Senate.

All presidential candidates must personalize themselves. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) talks about her Okie upbringing on the “ragged edge” of the middle class. Biden is ""Middle-Class Joe,” and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is the gal from the heartland. Perhaps in fully inhabiting her role as an African American female trailblazer and a progressive insider, Harris’s will find the focus and clarity she needs.

Never before have I seen Democratic candidates do so much to woo workers and win over union leaders. Elizabeth Warren kicked off her campaign at the site of the famous 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julián Castro marched in Durham, North Carolina, with fast-food workers demanding a $15 wage, while Pete Buttigieg spoke outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco alongside drivers demanding to be considered employees. Joe Biden held his first official campaign event at a Teamsters union hall in Pittsburgh. Kamala Harris has called for a raise averaging $13,500 for the nation’s schoolteachers, while Bernie Sanders has bolstered labor’s cause by using his email lists to urge supporters to join union picket lines.

Why all this sudden attention and affection for workers and unions — far more than I’ve ever seen during my nearly 25 years of writing about labor? Part of it is that this year’s Democratic candidates are doing what any smart politician would do when the field is so large — court one of the party’s largest constituencies, i.e., unions and their members. Part of it is that the candidates see that something is seriously broken in our economy: that income inequality, corporate profits, and the stock market have all been soaring while wages have largely stagnated for decades. Also, Democrats realize that a big reason Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 was that she didn’t show enough love to labor. The field seems to recognize that if a Democrat is going to win the presidency in 2020, the surest route is to win back the three longtime union strongholds — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that were key to Donald Trump’s victory. So the candidates have loosed a flood of pro-worker ideas, not just to make it easier to unionize, but to extend paid sick days and family leave to all workers, provide protections to pregnant workers, and safeguard LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination on the job.

Four of them — Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rouke, Pete Buttigieg, and Cory Booker — have put forward remarkably detailed platforms of pro-worker and pro-union proposals, while Elizabeth Warren’s elaborate plan on trade goes far beyond what many union leaders have called for. Andrew Yang says his universal basic income will be a boon for workers, providing a lifeline to those who lose their jobs because of artificial intelligence and robots. Biden has been vague so far on labor matters, calling himself a union man and saying he supports a $15 minimum. Booker has introduced a fairly radical bill, the Worker Dividend Act, which would require corporations that do stock buybacks to pay out to their employees a sizable chunk of the money going to the buyback.

Considering how many candidates there are and how many proposals and speeches they’ve made, it’s hard to keep track of who stands for what — and which plans are substantively the most pro-labor. Below, I give grades to the Democratic front-runners, based not just on the positions they’ve espoused during the campaign, but also on their track records. (Some candidates seem to have discovered the cause of workers only after announcing that they were running for the presidency.)

I confess to one bias in grading the candidates. In my new book, Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor, I write that union power and worker power in the U.S. have fallen to their weakest point since World War II, and that this has fueled wage stagnation, out-of-control income inequality and a warped political system in which corporations and billionaire donors have far too much sway and workers far too little. In grading, I give extra points to candidates who are pushing or proposing strategies to fix this systemic problem and give American workers more power — in the workplace, in politics, and in policymaking.

Some will complain that the grades I give are too high, but it is important to remember that when it comes to worker issues, every Democratic candidate is head and shoulders above almost every Republican lawmaker. Republicans overwhelmingly oppose a higher minimum wage and basic protections like paid sick days, seeming to dread displeasing corporate donors and lobbyists. Most Republicans favor weakening labor unions, not strengthening them. Moreover, the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation, has given the Democratic candidates’ high scores for their career legislative records: Cory Booker (100), Kamala Harris (100), Bernie Sanders (98), Elizabeth Warren (98), Julian Castro (96), Amy Klobuchar (95), Beto O’Rourke (94). Of the candidates, Joe Biden has the lowest AFL-CIO score (86), based on when he left the Senate in 2009. Some labor experts say that in the highly polarized Congress, in which Republicans are often seeking to undermine unions, it’s not hard for Democrats to garner high AFL-CIO ratings. Still, this year’s progressive crop of candidates supports many bills that would go far to help union and workers, like the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would make it easier to unionize, and the Healthy Families Act, which would require most companies to provide full-time workers with seven paid sick days a year.

A

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has fought for workers ever since he entered Congress in 1991, introducing the Workplace Democracy Act in 1992, and reintroducing it in every Congress since. That bill would make it easier for workers to unionize by, among other things, giving them a right to do so as soon as a majority of workers sign pro-union cards rather than through a lengthy election process that strongly favors employers.

Sanders didn’t suddenly start joining union picket lines this year. In 2015, he marched alongside Verizon workers as well as workers picketing outside their potato-starch factory in Cedar Rapids. Sanders told those workers in Iowa, “We are sick and tired of the war against working families.” In this election cycle, Sanders has already won the endorsement of the United Electrical Workers, a small union with 35,000 members.

The labor platform that Sanders has announced this year envisions doubling union membership in four years. It is a dream list for the nation’s unions. Sanders wants to strengthen workers’ clout through legislation that promotes industry-wide bargaining (instead of employer-by-employer bargaining). He would prohibit awarding federal contracts to companies that pay less than $15 an hour; he would also ban right-to-work laws, allow all government employees to unionize, and prohibit employers from permanently replacing workers who go on strike. In perhaps his most radical proposal, Sanders calls for ending America’s at-will employment system — he would prohibit employers from firing workers except for “just cause.”

Sanders’s platform for a Green New Deal has helped lead the way in reassuring unions upset with climate-change activists; he has called for a “just transition” for fossil-fuel workers who lose their jobs if and when the nation shutters coal-fired power plants and takes other actions to slow global warming. Sanders would guarantee those workers five years of current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pensions support, and “priority job replacement for any displaced worker.”

Sanders has loudly opposed free-trade agreements. His repeated calls for Medicare for All have cheered many workers and some labor leaders, even as Joe Biden has attacked Medicare for All, saying it would take away the excellent health coverage won by many unions.

Sanders’s supporters argue that he has long been the most pro-labor of the candidates, but others point out that for all his pro-worker rhetoric, he has racked up few concrete victories for workers. Sanders counters that he has led the way on, for example, legislation protecting IBM workers’ pensions and doubling home-heating assistance to help low-income workers. Sanders has been Congress’ most outspoken champion of a $15 minimum wage, and is often given credit for helping persuade Jeff Bezos to boost the base wage at Amazon to that level.

A

Elizabeth Warren

Warren doesn’t have a pro-labor record stretching back decades, but she has been a remarkable fount of innovative, pro-worker ideas. Some union officials told me that her proposal on trade was by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker. Criticizing the U.S. for long pursuing “a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers,” Warren has proposed using trade agreements as a tool “to force other countries to raise the bar on everything from labor and environmental standards to anti-corruption rules.” Asserting that corporate lobbyists have long whispered into the ears of our trade negotiators, Warren has called for a far more transparent process and proposed that worker, environmental, and consumer representatives sit on committees that advise America’s trade negotiators.

Warren’s “Plan for Economic Patriotism” is far more thoughtful than anything Trump has developed to encourage and bring back manufacturing jobs. She calls for leveraging federal R&D to spur investment and job creation, noting that Apple has used technologies developed through federally sponsored R&D to produce tens of millions of iPhones overseas. To aid depressed communities, Warren says, “R&D investments should be spread across every region of the country, not focused on only a few coastal cities.” To boost the job prospects of young Americans who don’t go to college, she has proposed a tenfold increase — a total of $20 billion over ten years — for apprenticeship programs.

In a daring proposal, Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act would give labor far more voice in the economy by letting workers elect 40 percent of the board members of large American corporations. Her path-breaking work to create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been a boon to working families, helping prevent banks from imposing extortionate fees and helping keep payday lenders from preying on down-on-their-luck workers.

As Blue Compass, a political and opposition research firm, makes clear, week after week Warren has done far more on social media than other candidates to go to bat for unions, for instance, doing videos on behalf of Las Vegas hotel workers seeking a contract. Amid concerns that Medicare for All might hurt some union members, Warren has pledged to include labor leaders in all Medicare for All discussions. “Strengthening America’s labor unions will be a central goal of my administration,” Warren told In These Times. She recently won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which had endorsed Sanders in 2016.

Last Monday, at her rally in Washington Square that attracted 20,000 New Yorkers, Warren spoke movingly and at length about the 1911 Triangle Fire, about the 146 Triangle workers who died, and about the brilliant efforts, led by Frances Perkins, who later served as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor, to prevent more such factory disasters — and to improve conditions overall for America’s workers.

Pete Buttigieg

Mayor Pete’s platform on labor, A New Rising Tide, is one of the very best things I’ve read from any modern-day politician on worker issues. He sees much injustice in the workplace: that Uber misclassifies workers as independent contractors to deny them basic worker protections, that the McDonald’s franchising model undermines workers’ ability to unionize, that Google hires so many temps and independent contractors to undermine workers’ bargaining power. “The hard truth is that while the economy changed, workers’ voices” have been “systematically silenced,” Buttigieg writes. “Our economy has been tilted towards the wealthy and away from the middle and working class because the people in power designed our laws and policies that way.”

Buttigieg’s platform would raise the federal minimum wage to $15, end right-to-work laws, give workers the power to unionize through card check, guarantee paid sick leave and family leave, ban the use of permanent replacement workers, and take strong steps to curb corporations’ often-intimidating sway over unionization elections.

Union officials in Indiana say that Buttigieg, though just 37, is not a Johnny-come-lately in supporting labor. He sided with labor unions when Indiana Republicans sought to repeal the state’s “common construction wage law,” which helped assure higher wages for construction workers. Buttigieg also signed a labor-backed “responsible bidding” ordinance that requires businesses seeking city contracts with South Bend to disclose OSHA violations.

“He’s been fantastic,” Jim Gardner, an official with the Operating Engineers union told In These Times. Buttigieg’s unsuccessful campaign for state treasurer in 2010 was run out of the offices of South Bend’s building trades unions.

B

Joe Biden

Biden was the first candidate to secure a union endorsement, receiving it from the 320,000-member International Association of Fire Fighters. Its longtime president, Harold Schaitberger, lavished praise on his friend, saying, “He’s one of the staunchest advocates for working families. He knows that a strong middle class means a strong America.”

Nonetheless, Biden faces many questions from unions. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and while President Obama was considered pro-union, he negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Biden supported that agreement, and many unions deride it to this day, even after Trump pulled out of the agreement.

At his campaign’s official kickoff event at a Teamsters hall, Biden trumpeted, “I make no apologies. I am a union man.” Some union leaders were nonetheless upset that on the day Biden announced his candidacy — three days before the Teamsters hall event — he spoke at a high-dollar Philadelphia fundraiser organized by a senior executive at Comcast. Patrick Eiding, the president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, complained that the “first place he goes” is to a Comcast executive’s. “No connection with labor,” Eiding said. “It was a little disturbing.” One labor scholar, writing in May, said he could find only two instances when Biden appeared on a picket line, “once in Iowa, during his 1987 presidential campaign and just this month (May) in Boston,” backing the Stop and Shop supermarket strikers.

As a senator, Biden supported organized labor’s No. 1 priority, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it easier to unionize by, among other things, giving unions a right to use card check. At a forum sponsored by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in August, Biden spoke robustly for labor, decrying “an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits.”

The labor platform that Biden has sketched out so far is short, indeed abbreviated. He supports a $15 minimum wage, curbing noncompete clauses, easing occupational licensing requirements, and making it easier for workers to unionize and bargain (without spelling out how). None of this is the fight-like-hell stuff one might expect from someone who characterizes himself as a champion of labor.

Cory Booker

Booker has pushed some daring, unorthodox ideas to help workers. One is the Worker Dividend Act, a Senate bill he sponsored that would help workers share in a company’s profits by requiring corporations that do stock buybacks to pay their employees either an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the buyback or half of all profits above $250 million. Booker has also proposed a job guarantee that would give 15 cities or rural areas federal money so they can guarantee jobs to everyone who wants one. Economists say this pilot measure would go far to help marginal, struggling workers.

Booker has a reputation for being close to Wall Street — he defended Bain Capital when Barack Obama attacked it during the 2012 campaign, and received $2.2 million from the securities and investment industry, more than any other senator, during the 2013 to 2014 election cycle. Nonetheless, his record on worker rights and unions is progressive — he backs a $15 minimum wage and bills that would make it easier to unionize, including Sanders’s Workplace Democracy Act and the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Last Wednesday, Booker beefed up his labor bona fides by releasing an elaborate platform called “Opportunity and Justice for Workers.” In it, Booker says, “For most people in this country, our economy is broken.” His platform calls for sweeping new laws to make it easier to unionize, raise workers’ wages, and ease work-life balance.

Teachers’ unions have long been uneasy with Booker because he championed vouchers and charter schools as Newark’s mayor. Labor leaders complain that these moves siphon money from traditional public schools and undermine teachers’ unions. The Newark Teachers Union opposed Booker’s 2010 reelection as mayor. But Booker argues that that teachers’ union often obstructed moves to improve educational quality in Newark’s struggling schools. At a union forum in August, Booker said he would prioritize public schools and noted that the New Jersey Education Association, his state’s largest teachers’ union, had endorsed him as a Senate candidate.

B

Julián Castro

Castro has been the most outspoken candidate on behalf of immigrants, but his platform has been thin on worker and labor issues. (Vox’s labor reporter wrote that Castro “probably has the weakest labor platform” on worker issues.) He met with striking University of California medical workers and attended a meeting of campus workers at Stanford, his alma mater, to show support before they began contract negotiations with the university. (California’s early primary is especially important for Castro’s prospects.) He has spoken at various union audiences, but he hasn’t made lifting up workers a central theme of his campaign. Castro backs numerous measures that would help working families, including universal child care, paid family leave, and a $15 minimum wage.

B

Kamala Harris

Unlike Sanders, Booker, Buttigieg, and O’Rourke, Kamala Harris has not adopted a plan that shouts to the world that she is eager to expand unions. She has taken a different, sometimes innovative course. She has trumpeted a plan that would lift the pay of the nation’s public school teachers by $13,500 on average, a move that has delighted two of the nation’s largest and most powerful unions: the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. In July, Harris introduced legislation for a National Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights, which would help the nation’s nannies, housekeepers and caregivers by giving them minimum wage and overtime protections and paid time off and requiring their employers to give them written employment contracts. To reduce income inequality, Harris has introduced a bill called LIFT the Middle Class Act that would give a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to households earning under $100,000 annually.

Harris uses social media to promote various union causes, such as organizing UCLA’s medical residents. But she has not made battling for unions and workers a signature part of her campaign the way Sanders and Warren have and has not issued a detailed labor platform.

B

Beto O’Rourke

O’Rourke’s labor platform, A 21st Century Labor Contract, is an impressive, thoughtful document. He calls for lifting workers collectively by expanding unions and their bargaining clout, while also calling for lifting workers individually, legislating new worker rights, by, for instance, guaranteeing seven paid sick days.

In his labor platform, O’Rourke proposes a nationwide law to let all government workers and farm workers unionize, and doing likewise for all frontline supervisors and independent contractors. (Letting frontline supervisors join unions would greatly expand union power, especially during strikes; letting independent contractors unionize and bargain would be a powerful tool for gig workers.) O’Rourke would adopt nationwide rules making it far easier for Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig workers to be considered employees — a move that would extend minimum wage and overtime coverage to them as well as protections against sexual harassment and race discrimination. O’Rourke would establish government-appointed wage boards that would set, and presumably improve, wages and conditions for industries with low union membership — for instance, fast-food restaurants, nail salons, carwashes.

Although from conservative Texas, O’Rourke has forcefully called for raising the minimum wage to $15 so workers don’t have to juggle two and three jobs. Some labor advocates point out, with chagrin, that when O’Rourke was on the El Paso City Council in 2010, he questioned whether police and firefighters should have a right to bargain collectively. At the time, El Paso faced a large budget deficit due to the recession, and city officials wanted municipal unions to agree to defer their raises. O’Rourke was angry that the police union continued to insist on wage increases that he said amounted to 8 percent. At one point, O’Rourke even asked the city’s attorney whether there was a way to eliminate the police union. In a 2011 interview, he said, “I do not think it is in the community’s best interests, certainly not in the taxpayers’ best interests, to have collective bargaining by the police and firefighters.”

But more recently, O’Rourke has championed the right of all public-sector workers, including police officers to unionize, telling a union meeting in Houston in July, “We’ve seen the devastation in our communities and in our states when unions are not allowed to organize … As president, I want to make sure that we guarantee the right to organize for every educator and public servant in every state.”

B-

Amy Klobuchar

Klobuchar has “one of the vaguest labor platforms” of the Democratic candidates, Vox wrote recently. She often tells audiences that she is the daughter of a unionized teacher and newspaperman and granddaughter of a unionized iron ore miner. She says that “as President she’ll stand up against attempts to weaken unions,” adding, without offering details, that she wants to reform labor laws, protect collective bargaining rights and roll back right-to-work laws. In her first 100 days as president, she says, she will issue executive orders requiring federal contractors to pay at least $15 an hour, scrapping Trump’s rollback of overtime protections, and banning companies from requiring low-wage workers to sign noncompete clauses.

Despite her impressive rhetorical and debating skills, Klobuchar is not much of a fighter for workers — her focus is usually elsewhere — and this from a lawmaker whose state has a famous farm-labor tradition and has sent several warriors for workers to the Senate, most recently Paul Wellstone. Some former Klobuchar aides have said she can be an abusive boss. Based on interviews with ex-staffers, The New York Times wrote that Klobuchar was “not just demanding but often dehumanizing” and “not merely a tough boss,” but “the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.” Considering this, that’s all the more reason Klobuchar should be working doubly hard to show she is a champion of workers.

Andrew Yang

Yang talks as if his universal basic income program (which would guarantee $1,000 a month to every citizen over the age of 18) would be a boon for America’s workers. He says it would be a welcome supplement for low-wage and part-time workers and a lifeline to laid-off workers, helping them avoid misery and easing the pressure on them to take whatever job is offered them, no matter how low the pay. He says UBI would increase workers’ bargaining power “because a guaranteed, unconditional income gives them leverage to say no to exploitative wages and abusive working conditions” UBI would help workers who are on strike, Yang says, by enabling them to hold out longer and demand a better contract.

To my mind, Yang’s single issue — Yang calls it a “Freedom Dividend” — hardly begins to address, much less fix, the biggest problems American workers face: soaring income inequality and the overall decline of worker power. Some experts argue that UBI would encourage some employers to lower workers’ pay.

In a Labor Day blog post last year, Yang seemed to have only just discovered the importance of labor unions and collective worker action — he was marveling at the historic achievements of Walter Reuther, the UAW, and other unions, and how they played a pivotal role in building the world’s largest and richest middle class. In Yang’s platform, there is little acknowledgement of what collective action or unions have achieved and can achieve for American workers. (He inaccurately says union membership has dropped 70 percent from its peak; it’s dropped 30 percent.)

Many people I respect support UBI, especially to help the millions of workers who some predict will lose their jobs because of AI, robots, and other new technologies. I nonetheless wonder how will laid-off workers survive on $12,000 a year, especially when some supporters of UBI have called for weakening various parts of the social safety net. As far as I can tell, Yang — who is very eloquent in discussing the threat that new technologies pose to workers — has hardly discussed a key issue: the importance of giving workers (and not just corporate executives, technology gurus, and Silicon Valley investors) a voice in what new technologies will mean for workers and the economy. I fear that UBI, combined with technology-induced layoffs, will create an underclass of the long-term unemployed scraping by on $12,000 a year, and an overclass of very wealthy executives and investors who own and control the new technologies.

Donald Trump

Trump campaigned as a champion of workers, but his administration is unarguably the most anti-worker, anti-union administration since Ronald Reagan — and is arguably even more anti-worker. Trump and his appointees have taken dozens of actions to hurt workers. They have rolled back overtime protections extended to millions of workers and scrapped the “fiduciary rule” requiring Wall Street firms to act in workers’ best interests in handling 401k’s. His administration has reduced the number of OSHA inspectors and weakened safety requirements for oil-rig workers. Trump has made it easier to award federal contracts to corporations that have repeatedly violated minimum wage and overtime laws, race and sex discrimination laws, and laws protecting workers’ ability to unionize. His administration has hurt LGBTQ+ workers by urging the Supreme Court to rule that they are not covered by federal anti-discrimination laws.

Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, has long been corporate America’s top gun, its leading lawyer, in seeking to quash many new regulations protecting workers. Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, Neil Gorsuch, provided the pivotal vote in important cases that weakened public-sector unions and let corporations prohibit workers from bringing class actions, making it far harder for millions of Americans to vindicate their workplace rights. Trump’s appointees to the National Labor Relations Board have been extremely aggressive in seeking to weaken unions and obstruct union organizing – for instance, declaring that Uber and Lyft drivers shouldn’t be classified as employees, making it far harder to unionize franchises like McDonald’s, and vastly reducing the ability of contracted-out workers to picket employers.

The only reason Trump deserves an F-plus and not an F is that he had made good on one big promise to workers — his vow to fight on trade. He has pushed to revamp NAFTA and confront China. But in renegotiating NAFTA, Trump failed to do the one thing labor unions said was most needed: to make sure that NAFTA’s enforcement mechanisms had teeth so that Mexican workers could push for higher wages and to unionize without being suppressed or jailed.

Moreover, Trump has hugely mishandled his trade war with China. Any child can tell you that if you’re going to pick a fight with a powerful adversary, you want your friends lined up at your side. But Trump launched his trade war against China, the world’s second largest economic power, without getting important allies like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Australia to fight along with us. As a result of Trump’s unilateral trade war, China is feeling much less pressure and America’s workers, farmers, consumers, and corporations are getting battered. Trump deserves a failing grade for the way he has so badly bungled his trade war.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Joe Biden in Iowa for the first time in the state’s most influential poll. The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, released Saturday night, found that 22 percent of registered Democrats now say that Warren is their first choice among the Democratic presidential candidates, giving her a two-point lead over Biden and an 11-point lead over fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, whose first-choice support has fallen to just 11 percent of respondents. Though the results have a four-point margin of error, the gold-standard Register poll has consistently shown that Warren, with her impressive Iowa field organization, has continued to gain support in the state, particularly as other candidates in the wide Democratic field have lost luster among voters.

🚨🚨 Elizabeth Warren narrowly leads the @DMRegister/@CNN Iowa Poll for the first time.

Indeed, perhaps the best news for Warren in the poll, other than the new and narrow lead, is that 71 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers are now either supporting her or considering it — including the 22 percent who say she’s their first choice, another 20 percent who say she is their second choice, and 29 percent who say they are actively considering her as their potential pick. In addition, 75 percent of respondents viewed Warren favorably, besting South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg (69 percent) and Biden (66 percent).

Meanwhile, 60 percent of Iowa Democrats said they were considering Biden — though there is more confidence among his first-choice supporters than any others, with 26 percent saying they’ll definitely vote for the former vice-president, compared with just 12 percent of Warren supporters saying the same about her. 88 percent of Warren’s first-choicers said they were open to changing their minds, as did 70 percent of Biden backers. Overall, just one in five would-be caucus-goers said they had made up their mind with less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses on February 3.

This is one of my favorite ways we’ve broken down the race – it tries to include the entire universe of people considering these candidates.

Widely respected Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer emphasized the current flexibility of Iowans’ support in her analysis of the results, telling the Register that while the poll was the “first major shakeup” of the race, she still saw “opportunity aplenty” for candidates to shake things up again. “The leaders aren’t all that strong,” she commented on Saturday. “The universe is not locked in.”

That being said, Bernie Sanders has been consistently losing support in Iowa, according to the Register’s polling, as some of his most important constituencies have shifted to Warren. Per the new poll, nearly a third of the Iowans who caucused for Sanders in 2016 now plan to caucus for Warren instead, while only a quarter say they’ll repeat for Bernie. She leads among voters under 35, 27 percent of whom now consider Warren their first choice, to Sanders’s 22 percent (and Biden’s 9 percent.) Warren’s support among the very liberal is even higher, with 48 percent now backing her, versus only 20 percent for Sanders.

As expected, Biden continues to command the most support from older Democrats, attracting 35 percent of likely caucus-goers 65 and older — a nearly three-to-one lead over Warren among that demographic. And it’s not clear how Warren’s campaign for “big structural change” will sound to them or to the 59 percent of Iowa Democrats who expect the U.S. government to return to normal when the norm-demolishing Trump is out of the White House.

Only 28 percent of respondents said they were “extremely enthusiastic” about their current first-choice candidates, but note the gap at the top: 32 percent of Warren supporters were extremely enthusiastic about her, compared to 22 percent of Biden supporters, which is down from 29 percent in the June edition of the Register poll. (Looking at Biden’s not-great favorability trends, Selzer speculated that “he’s not wearing well” in the state.)

Lastly, Iowans were asked to weigh in a some electability factors as well. The ability to beat Trump was the most important candidate criteria for 63 percent of respondents, while 31 percent favored likemindedness on issues. As to what makes a candidate more electable, 74 percent said that the ability to excite and turn out out new voters mattered more than turning out the base (which was favored by 16 percent); 63 percent said positions which found common group with the GOP mattered more than leftward-moving ones (which was favored by 28 percent); 57 percent thought representing a new generation of leadership mattered more than a long record of government service (which was favored by 28 percent); and 54 percent of Democrats thought taking “the high road” against Trump was also important. (The muddy road was more important for 35 percent.)"

The poll was conducted Sept. 14-18 among 602 probable caucusgoers, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Filling out the top five were Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.). Buttigieg, whose campaign had a commanding presence at Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry, fell by 6 percentage points from the June poll.

Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) were both at 3 percent, ahead of a cluster of candidates registering at 2 percent and eight others polling at 1 percent or less.

The results show considerable room for movement over the next half-year. Only 1 in 5 likely caucusgoers said they were set on their first-choice candidate, while 63 percent said they could envision supporting someone else.

Sixty-three percent also said it was more important to them that the winner of the Iowa caucuses could beat President Trump than that the victor in February shared their positions on major issues.

AD

Warren has steadily gained ground in the Register’s polling, starting at 8 percent in December, before she had announced her candidacy. She came in at 9 percent in March and 15 percent in June.

The June poll differed from the survey whose results were released Saturday in seeking to take into account Iowa’s plan for a “virtual caucus,” which has since been scrapped because of concerns about whether phone technology could be secured against hacking.

A Monmouth University poll released last month suggested the addition of an option to participate over the phone, rather than attending an hours-long meeting in the biting cold, would have expanded support for Biden. The new poll reverted to the methodology of the first two Register surveys, which considered only in-person participation.

Jodi Stanfield, a volunteer for Warren in Des Moines, said she previously supported Sanders and admired both candidates, whose platforms she described as similarly ambitious on issues of health care and education. She now favors Warren because she can “actually get the work done,” said Stanfield, 51, who works at the YMCA of Greater Des Moines.

With four months to go before next year’s Feb. 3 caucuses, the competition for votes is intensifying in Iowa, with most Democrats still grappling with the question of who is best positioned to take on President Trump.

A new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll of likely caucus-goers released Saturday night found surging support for Warren in the race. According to the poll, 22 percent of likely caucus-goers said Warren is their first choice for the Democratic nomination. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 11 percent. No other candidate was in double digits.

The survey was more proof of Warren’s growing popularity in Iowa, where she has attracted large crowds for months. It marked the first notable shake-up in the race. Though Warren’s lead was narrow, Biden had been the polling leader in all three of the Register’s 2020 polls, including the most recent one in June.

AD

AD

The poll was released after a whirlwind day of campaigning at the Steak Fry, which has been an essential Iowa tradition for presidential candidates for the past 40 years since it was launched as a small grass-roots fundraiser for Tom Harkin, a revered Iowa Democrat who retired from the U.S. Senate in 2014. It has long been regarded as one of the best opportunities for a candidate to make a splash among Iowa Democrats and show their organizational force.

Biden, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., each reserved massive spaces to rally their supporters. And like all the campaigns, they each led big parades to the stage, including Harris, who danced with a drum line and hundreds of cheering supporters.

The show of force comes at a pivotal time for Harris, who has been lagging in national and Iowa polls. She announced in the past week that she is going all-in on Iowa in hopes of placing in the top three, a ticket that her campaign hopes could propel her to South Carolina and into Super Tuesday. “I don’t know if you heard,” Harris cheekily said on the stage. “I’m moving to Iowa.”

AD

AD

Harris was not the only candidate looking to the Steak Fry for a jolt of life. While Booker marched into the event with scores of enthusiastic supporters and received a standing ovation from most of the crowd, he offered a more dire assessment of his campaign offstage. He told reporters if he can’t raise $1.7 million in coming days that he will reconsider whether he has the “pathway” to win the nomination. “I don’t believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,” he said. “You either have a trajectory to win or not.”

Biden arrived at the Steak Fry as the national polling leader, with scores of supporters who turned up early to rally with the former vice president. His parade included a firetruck packed with members of the International Association of Firefighters, a union that has endorsed his campaign, which sounded its siren to announce Biden’s entrance into the event.

Biden was immediately swarmed by supporters clamoring for photographs and signatures. He pumped his fist, keeping the rhythm of a chant of his name, and reached through a mass of cameras to shake hands. Racing to a grill, where the candidates each spent time cooking chicken and steak, Biden threw on an apron. “Put me to work,” he said.

AD

Onstage, Biden made no mention of reports that Trump had urged the Ukranian president to open up an investigation into a company with ties to Biden’s son Hunter.

But hours before, at a gaggle with reporters, Biden called Trump’s actions an “overwhelming abuse of power” and urged congressional Democrats to investigate. He also suggested the president’s actions indicated he is worried about winning reelection.

Trump “knows I’ll beat him like a drum,” the former vice president told reporters.

While the Biden campaign bought more than a thousand tickets to hand out to supporters, the Warren campaign bought just 200, gambling that her supporters would turn out without much nudging.

AD

And as the senator from Massachusetts took the stage, thousands of Warren signs popped up into the air.

Afterward, Warren spent more than two hours at her campaign booth, posing for more than 1,000 selfies in what has become her signature campaign move. Among those waiting in line was Trey Hill, a middle school teacher from Ankeny, who said he’d narrowed down his choices to Warren, Buttigieg and Sanders.

“For Warren, for me, it was definitely . . . her confidence, her just sheer strength and determination to fight for what she believes in. I’m really interested in Bernie just because he is kind of the impetus to this revolution that we have going on,” Hill said. “And Pete, I just think that he’s one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever heard speak and I think that he’s got a mind to really take this country really far.”

When he got to the front of the line, a Warren aide took Hill’s phone; he would have about three seconds with the senator.

“I’m with you in this fight!” Hill blurted out.

“Absolutely, thank you!” Warren told him.

With that big poll now public, here are some overarching questions for the broader 2020 race.

1. How much trouble is Bernie Sanders in (especially in Iowa)?

The big news this weekend was that Warren had overtaken Biden (albeit still within the margin of error) in the new poll. But that wasn’t all that far-fetched given Warren’s ascendancy.

Perhaps the second biggest piece of news in the poll was that Sanders’s Iowa troubles appear to be very real. We had seen some evidence of this before, but now it seems safe to say it. Of the last four live-caller polls in Iowa, Sanders is at 11 percent in this one and 9 percent in the three previous ones. He does better in online polls, but every high-quality poll has him lagging behind his national showing.

AD

AD

Why is that important? Because he nearly won the state in 2016, yet early signs suggest he’s not even an option for many voters there. Another poll last week showed more likely caucusgoers had ruled out supporting him (46 percent) than were considering it (43 percent.)

It’s also important because national polls still have them running neck and neck for second place. Given that both Sanders and Warren hail from a state that neighbors New Hampshire (Sanders from Vermont and Warren from Massachusetts), the one who finishes better in Iowa would seem to have the inside track ahead of the Granite State’s primary.

And if one of them drops out at that point, it could reshape the race.

AD

2. How will Elizabeth Warren wear?

Warren is the one candidate with demonstrated momentum pretty much throughout the 2020 race. Being in the lead in Iowa would seem to be the culmination of all that.

AD

But she’s thus far largely avoided her opponents’ fire, and that’s starting to change. She has also in the past struggled to deal with the controversy over her past claim of Native American heritage, muddling through efforts to put it behind her. Then there is the electability issue — however fair — when it comes to Democrats nominating another polarizing, intellectual woman, this time a former Harvard University professor from Massachusetts.

It’s too easy to caricature Warren as an unelectable extremist. But Democratic voters are completely preoccupied with nominating someone — anyone — who can beat Trump. The same new Iowa poll shows twice as many emphasized that (63 percent) as emphasized agreement on the issues (31 percent).

AD

They seem to like Warren in a way they don’t like the others; her main task is persuading them to vote with their heart while believing in their minds that it will work out. The good news for her is she seems to be doing that, at least in Iowa, where she’s tied with Biden at 22 percent with electability-first voters.

AD

We’ll see if that holds — and if the rest of the country begins to agree.

3. Is Joe Biden’s electability edge ironclad?

Related to the point above: If Warren is the candidate of Democrats’ hearts, Biden is the choice of their minds. Nearly every poll shows he is viewed as the most electable. So if Democrats just want to win, he should be able to stick around.

AD

But just as we should challenge our assumptions about Warren’s electability deficit, we should challenge them about Biden’s electability edge.

Part of that is because Biden is the most well-known candidate in the race who is also easiest to see in the role of a president — in large part because he was right next to one for eight years. We shouldn’t discount how much this is because he’s simply the biggest known quantity in the field and thus makes the most sense for casual voters.

AD

It’s also worth questioning whether he’ll maintain that perception. Biden’s previous presidential runs haven’t gone well, and there have already been plenty of stumbles early in his 2020 campaign. It’s one thing to be the vice president whom people can see being president; it’s another to be the candidate who can’t quite shoot straight. If he can’t be as compelling or as steady as Warren or other candidates, perhaps Democrats will start to adjust their preconceptions about how he might fare in the general election.

AD

4. Is Biden’s black support sustainable?

A big reason Biden continues to lead in national polling — even as he doesn’t do as well in Iowa and New Hampshire — is black voters.

Even after tangling with Harris on busing and criticism from another black candidate, Sen. Cory Booker, about Biden’s comments about working with segregationist senators, Biden is still above 40 percent with African Americans in most polls. A recent poll of the South Carolina primary showed him taking 51 percent of that demographic there.

AD

This demographic advantage was huge for Hillary Clinton in 2016; Sanders’s inability to appeal to black voters basically made him unelectable in a party whose nominating process they play such a major role in (around one-quarter of all voters).

AD

As Philip Bump has written, black voters may not be the silver bullet for Biden that they were for Clinton. But it’s his most loyal demographic in the 2020 race right now, and it’s the one keeping him in the lead nationally. If he can maintain that through the early states and especially heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday, he’ll stand a good chance. If he can’t, the math becomes much more difficult.

5. What’s the deal with Pete Buttigieg?

We’ve talked about the first three candidates in that Iowa poll. The fourth one, though, is a major X-Factor.

AD

The new Iowa poll shows Buttigieg has the second-highest favorable rating in Iowa (behind Warren), at 69 percent. He also has the lowest unfavorable rating of anyone (Warren included), at 13 percent. People really like the guy. And so do donors, judging by Buttigieg’s surprise win in the second-quarter fundraising race.

AD

But the same Iowa voters who really like him also still have him in fourth place, at 9 percent — behind candidates they don’t like as much.

The easy and perhaps overly simplistic explanation is that maybe they like the South Bend, Ind., mayor — and quite a bit — but that they can’t necessarily see the boyish 37-year-old as their president or as being capable of beating Trump. An alternate explanation is that they are warm to him even if they haven’t quite been convinced. That suggests they could eventually come around, which is pretty much all he could ask at this point, given where he started this race.

There has been a lot of talk about how Buttigieg maybe hasn’t delivered on that fundraising. He seems to have plenty of upside, though. And the fact that he’s not alienating key voters is significant.

DES MOINES — In just 24 hours, the candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination gathered to endorse a bold LGBTQ rights agenda, spoke to the largest outdoor “steak fry” in the party's history and watched a new poll reshape the wisdom about the caucuses.

Not a whole lot really changed. Policy disagreements were minor at the GLAAD forum in Cedar Rapids: Every candidate agreed to pass the Equality Act and reinstate Obama-era protections. The weekend’s big arguments were mostly imported by TV, from Stephen Colbert’s questions to Elizabeth Warren about tax increases to the scandal over President Trump plying Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden. (More about that below.) But with each week, the field settles a little more, and the straggling candidates see their problems a little more clearly.

The Elizabeth Warren backlash is coming. Even before the release of the Des Moines Register's Selzer & Co. poll, which put Warren at 22 percent support to Joe Biden's 20 percent, the senator from Massachusetts had reshaped the Democratic primary. Six months ago, some rival campaigns had written her off. Two months ago, no candidate saw an upside in attacking her. But that was then, and now, Warren is the only Democratic candidate who has successfully executed her initial plan: to build massive campaigns in the early states and compete for a win in Iowa.

Warren’s strength was visible all weekend, from the standing ovation she got at Friday’s LGBTQ forum to the friendliest audience at the steak fry. (Warren’s campaign bought half as many tickets as that of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but her speech got roughly the same response as his, and she edged him in a friendly corn kernel poll on-site.) She made two sharp moves that did not occur to other leading candidates: reading to the Cedar Rapids audience the names of trans women of color who had been killed in 2019 and starting her steak fry speech with a fresh call for Trump’s impeachment.

According to the Selzer poll, Warren is now the most well-liked Democrat in the field, with the most first-choice and second-choice support from voters. The other 16 candidates competing for Iowa can’t allow that. By the end of Saturday, Warren had taken some flack from the left, for telling the People’s Action forum in Des Moines (limited to a few left-wing candidates) that she did not support a national rent control policy; Sanders does. She’d gotten some blowback from the party’s centrists, though they had been harsher in interviews leading up to the weekend.

“We won the House back in 2018 with Democrats running on a public option, not Medicare-for-all,” Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said at the steak fry.

The temptation in looking at any caucus is to compare it to past years. In 2003, Howard Dean surged with liberal voters before panic set in that he couldn’t win the general election. In 2015, Republicans ignored Donald Trump’s rise or actively encouraged it — think of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas saying Trump was “terrific” — because they incorrectly believed he’d eventually collapse.

Warren, who has twice defended herself from attacks in debates, doesn’t resemble either candidate, but there’s a growing irritation at the how-she-does it media coverage she gets. Supporters of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) grumbled that she got a sterner question than Warren about their shared “evolution” on using Medicare money to pay for gender transition. No candidate has thrived from going after a rival, least of all by attacking Warren, but when the media's focus turns to a candidate, things can change fast.

Bernie Sanders is struggling. In June, when the “Selzer poll” found the senator from Vermont's support at just 16 percent, the Sanders campaign insisted that the pollster was not capturing the strength of its game plan. They claimed to have 26,000 “volunteers” in the state — a number based on initial sign-ups when he entered the race — and to be activating voters who had never caucused before and, as such, didn’t show up in public polls.

Since then, the Sanders campaign has parted with its Iowa political director and deputy director, admitting what it won’t say: The plan wasn’t working. Sanders is now less popular with Democrats than he was four years ago. Thirty-six percent of caucusgoers view him unfavorably, when just 8 percent held that view in the autumn before the 2016 caucus.

Sanders has declined without making any traditional mistakes. When asked in the Selzer poll how they defined “electability,” a supermajority of Iowa Democrats — 74 percent — said it was “exciting new voters to show up.” That's exactly what Sanders has been arguing for years that he can do. At the steak fry, like at every “cattle call,” Sanders eschewed big shows of enthusiasm to emphasize organizing. His campaign claimed to have made 26,000 phone calls and knocked 5,000 doors during the event.

But it hasn't solved Sanders's central problem: He has reactivated his donor base but hasn't reunited his electoral coalition. Refusing to attack Warren, Sanders has instead proposed policies that go further than hers, such as canceling all medical debt and imposing national rent control to stabilize housing. So far it hasn't stopped active Democrats from migrating to the candidates they like more.

Cory Booker is struggling and strangely happy to talk about it. Booker is one of several Democrats doing everything that Iowans ask — showing up, getting crowds, growing more popular — and seeing no benefit in polls or momentum. His campaign decided to do something about that Saturday, announcing that he would need to raise an oddly specific $1.7 million or quit the race. According to Booker’s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, Iowans liked Booker but didn’t realize how precarious his situation was.

“They think he's fine, and they think they have more time to decide,” Demissie said on a conference call. “They think that this thing is going to narrow over the coming months … but the point that we're trying to make very clearly is that the [candidates] offered to the Democratic Party come February, March, and April are being determined right now, in September. And these resources ultimately are what determines who is going to stay in this race.”

Booker’s campaign claimed to have raised more than $300,000 since the do-or-die announcement, and the senator from New Jersey really is in a better position than other candidates in the single digits. In the Selzer poll, Booker’s net favorable rating (the percentage of voters who like him, minus the percentage who don’t) is 38 percent, compared with 36 in June. Outside the Warren-Biden-Sanders triad at the top of the polls, just Booker and three other Democrats have double-digit favorables: Harris’s net rating is 39 percent, Klobuchar’s is 30 percent, O’Rourke’s is 28 percent. The race has stratified between seven Democrats who most Iowa voters generally like and nine Democrats to whom they’re either negative or indifferent.

TV ads haven't done much. On Aug. 8, Harris's campaign went on the Iowa airwaves for the first time. On Aug. 20, Biden's campaign joined in. And on Sept. 6, after airing a pair of radio spots about the mayor's post-partisan American Dream, Buttigieg's campaign boiled them down into a TV ad.

All three of these Democrats were flat, or had lost support, in the latest Selzer poll. Harris and Biden had seen their unfavorable ratings double over the past six months, while Buttigieg grew more popular; his strength as a second-choice candidate has been growing, even as fewer voters say he's their first choice. But the only obvious effect of TV advertising so far has been putting Tom Steyer, who has spent millions on commercials, onto the board; he clocked in at 2 percent, though more Democrats viewed him unfavorably than favorably. Big TV buys used to do more.

The “virtual caucus” is dead. It didn't get much fanfare, and there was no grilled meat involved, but shortly before the weekend started, Iowa Democrats announced the solution to their years-long problem of trying to boost participation in the caucuses. The DNC rules committee “tentatively” approved a plan to add “satellite” caucus sites in 2020, where voters who have given a reason that they cannot physically attend the caucuses can be counted.

“Each satellite location will have a trained captain who is charged with overseeing the room, managing volunteers, and reporting the results on caucus night. The results will be reported using the same method as precinct caucus locations,” the state party announced Friday. “The satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each Congressional District.”

The new system will (unless it changes again) work quasi-absentee votes into the caucus count; it won’t create a separate, online pool of votes for a “virtual caucus.” The few polls conducted of that “virtual” contest found Joe Biden, who’s more popular with moderates than liberals, doing very well. Nixing it may help the campaigns with traditional grass-roots campaigns and activist energy.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

After the first reports that the president might have pressured Ukraine's president to get dirt on his son, Joe Biden told reporters that Trump should “start to be the president” and stop abusing his powers. The next day, at the steak fry, Biden took a question from a Fox News reporter — how many times had he talked to Hunter Biden about his “overseas business” dealings? Biden said he’d never talked to him about it, then let rip.

“I know Trump deserves to be investigated,” Biden. “He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate him, if that’s what happened?” After accusing the president of “abuse of power” and saying he’d “beat him like a drum,” Biden was asked whether the president should be impeached: “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached, but I’m not making that judgment right now.”

Both the Friday and Saturday exchanges with reporters came from the same premise: Biden, campaigning to restore the pre-Trump norms of good government, was saying that Trump was breaking those norms to smear him. Other candidates might get into the mix with the president, but Biden has positioned himself as a back-to-normalcy candidate: “America is coming back like it used to be,” like he said when he launched. His approach to the president is a mix of disappointment, disbelief and shame.

None of that gives Trump pause. On Sunday, Trump said without evidence that “Biden and his son” were adding to “the corruption already in the Ukraine,” then taunted Biden for saying he had not spoken to his son: “Of course you spoke to your son!” Later, on talk shows, the president’s surrogates inside and outside the administration, who have brushed aside questions about actions of the president’s kin, advanced the completely unproved accusations of Biden family corruption.

“If it's the case that there was something going on with the president or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that,” said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“I think the bigger story here is really what went on with Biden and his son?” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “He came out over the weekend and said he never spoke to his son. Yet the facts are his son said they had spoken.” And Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, went even further, going on Fox News to call Hunter Biden a “recovering drug addict” and stoke speculation that his deals in Ukraine were subjects for the former vice president to answer.

Democrats don’t know how this will play. But they know how similar tactics played in 2016. At that time, the president exploited voter worries about Hillary Clinton by turning any accusation he could back onto her, most dramatically by inviting women who’d accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second presidential debate. Clinton was hamstrung by the impression that she could not be trusted, and both she and Trump lurched into Election Day with most voters saying that they found neither of them to be “honest and trustworthy.”

Biden, after a lifetime in politics, does not have a similar image. He famously did not get rich during his years in the Senate. Having watched anger boil over at Clinton for giving high-priced speeches, he approached his post-vice presidency career cautiously. The media reception to Trump’s Ukraine gambit has been incredibly skeptical, similar to the reaction when Trump made baseless charges against Republican opponents in 2015.

But Trump’s party was not united behind him then; now it is. Democrats were largely united around Hillary Clinton when Trump made his 2016 attacks; they are not united behind Biden. Only a few of his rivals have commented on the back-and-forth, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) telling the president to “leave Joe Biden alone” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) kicking off her steak fry remarks by referring to Trump's actions.

“It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,” Warren said.

Biden hadn't called for impeachment, only investigation. For nine months, the president really hasn't had much of a role in the Democratic primary; candidates have been more responsive to the left's demands than to anything Trump is saying. Attacking Biden could backfire and rally Democrats around him. In the short term, it's making him demonstrate how he'd handle the specious attacks that Trump embraced again and again in 2016. He's more able to punch back than Hillary Clinton, but his overall theory is the same: Ask voters to consider whether they really want Trump's ethics in the White House.

The crosstabs and sub-questions in this poll portray a very muddled Democratic Iowa primary electorate, with the top three candidates commanding less first-choice support than in any recent contest. At this point in 2007, in this poll, 74 percent of Democrats picked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John Edwards as their first choice; the combined support for the top candidates now is 53 percent. And there are other reasons so many candidates in the doldrums see a potential comeback if the race keeps shuffling and if Joe Biden — the only top candidate not running from the left — loses more support.

For now, the poll positions Warren as the candidate with the most first-choice and second-choice support, stitching together a coalition of liberals who backed Sanders in 2016 and Hillary Clinton supporters; Sanders gets no support from Clinton 2016 voters. Looming over her is the Medicare-for-all question, and for reasons very familiar to nervous Democrats. Most caucusgoers support Medicare-for-all, with 41 percent saying they like it and just 24 percent coming out against it. The crucial swing vote: the 28 percent of Democrats who say they personally like the policy but fret that it would hurt the party in a general election. Warren leads Biden by four points with these voters, with big implications.

There are years when many candidates for president are popular. This is not one of those years. This poll, which also pushes voters for answers on every major Democratic proposal (replacing private insurance is unpopular, a large immigration amnesty is not), finds that no Democratic candidate would start the election with as much active opposition as the president but that none is particularly popular.

While Biden outperforms other Democrats in trial heats, and while his coalition does not entirely overlap with Warren's, he has about the same level of support and opposition; Sanders, who for a long time was the most broadly popular candidate, has the lowest ceiling of support. The Democratic “electability” conversation has not changed much recently, but the numbers have.

IN THE STATES

Massachusetts. Rep. Joe Kennedy III started his Senate campaign with a whirlwind tour of Massachusetts and nothing bad to say about Sen. Ed Markey, who he'd be replacing if he won. Markey challenged Kennedy and lesser-known opponents to a climate debate, possibly to highlight how Markey has been a left-wing leader on the issue and Kennedy has been an ally, but not a lead messenger.

Mississippi. Jennifer Riley Collins, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, would be the first woman to hold the office and the first black woman elected to any statewide job. But she has not been endorsed by Attorney General Jim Hood, the Democrats' nominee for governor; she has pressured Hood to endorse her, without success. Hood, the only statewide elected Democrat, has largely run on his own ticket.

2020

Bill de Blasio’s presidential campaign ended Friday, but the indignities were not over. On Sunday, Selzer & Co. released the year’s third Iowa poll, with the remarkable fact that no one — no one in three polls over six months — had listed the mayor of New York City as their top choice for president. No one had listed him as their second choice, either. De Blasio’s campaign ended without much praise from rival candidates and with, unsurprisingly, a gleeful New York Post obituary on the tabloid’s front page.

“Like NYC mayors before me, I knew what I signed up for,” de Blasio texted BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith.

What did de Blasio’s campaign accomplish? Not much. He did not build out grass-roots campaigns in the early states, appearing instead at party events and meet-and-greets. (The worst of these, which even the mayor had to admit was funny, was a video chat appearance at the Iowa AFL-CIO meeting in which a glitch raised de Blasio’s voice to an “Alvin and the Chipmunks” pitch.)

He had a memorable premise, that there was plenty of wealth in America but in “the wrong hands.” But he didn’t shift the debate on his terms like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren had; his idea of a “robot tax” to fight automation went mostly unnoticed.

De Blasio’s biggest impact came in the televised debates; he qualified for two of them, before the standards tightened in September, and he ensured that former Alaska senator Mike Gravel would not make it. (Gravel’s campaign qualified for the first two debates thanks to hitting 65,000 individual donations.) In June and July, de Blasio emerged as a pugilist on Sanders’s and Warren’s behalf, raising his hand when asked whether he would eliminate private insurance, then aggressively defending the idea.

Bernie Sanders. He took another jab at Joe Biden during a Thursday event in Chapel Hill, N.C., chiding the former vice president for his fundraising schedule: “Joe, we are not going to make the changes we need in this country when you go to three fundraisers in Chicago sponsored by multimillionaires.” Sanders is campaigning in Oklahoma on Sunday before returning to Iowa on a “Bernie beats Trump” tour.

Pete Buttigieg. The steak fry was the start of a four-day swing through Iowa; Buttigieg is traveling through the northeastern part of the states on his first campaign bus tour, through Tuesday.

Joe Biden. He headed to Kansas City and St. Louis to raise money after the steak fry; Sunday he addressed striking GM workers in Kansas City. On Monday he'll attend the funeral of Emily Clyburn, the late wife of the House majority whip.

Elizabeth Warren. She joined striking autoworkers in Detroit on Sunday, in support of the UAW's demand for higher wages and permanent job offers for temporary employees. Earlier, Tim Ryan made a mini-road trip of strike locations, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) rallied with workers during her “blue wall” trip to Michigan.

But if the president is essentially withholding military aid, at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, that is, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.

We’re going to hear from the director of national intelligence on Thursday why he is the first director to withhold ever a whistleblower complaint. And we are going to make sure that we get that complaint, that whistleblower is protected.

And we're going to make sure that we find out whether the president has engaged in this kind of improper conduct. But it may be that we do have to move forward with that extraordinary remedy, if indeed the president is, at the same time withholding vital military assistance, he is trying to leverage that to obtain impermissible help in his political campaign.

Amtrak says it is reinventing its dining service on long-distance trains, killing the traditional dining car to create more “flexible” and “contemporary” dining options.

AD

The carrier says the change, starting this fall on the one-night routes east of the Mississippi River, is driven by the desire to save money and lure a younger generation of new riders — chiefly, millennials known to be always on the run, glued to their phones and not particularly keen on breaking bread with strangers at a communal table.

AD

With the transition, Amtrak is doing away with the traditional onboard kitchen, switching to serving prepackaged meals and easing restrictions on the traditional serving times. The change allows the railroad to cut costs associated with cooking aboard and keeping up with the white-tablecloth service that was once known to rival high-end restaurants and clubs.

Amtrak isn’t labeling the change the end of the dining car, but rather an evolution more in line with the demands of this era.

“It is part of an evolution,” said Peter Wilander, who oversees Amtrak’s customer experience. “The concept is to provide service the way our customers want rather than have everybody conform to one service delivery.

“Some people really like [the dining car] and view it as sort of a nostalgic train experience,” Wilander said. “Some people, especially our new millennial customers, don’t like it so much. They want more privacy, they don’t want to feel uncomfortable sitting next to people” they don’t know.

It’s that demographic, he said, that Amtrak wants to attract with more contemporary car designs and food options.

For now, the changes are only on Amtrak’s one-night routes on the East Coast. The “flexible” dining service for sleeping car customers starts Oct. 1 on the Cardinal (New York-Chicago), City of New Orleans (Chicago-New Orleans), Crescent (New York-New Orleans) and Silver Meteor (New York-Miami). The shift will happen next year on the Silver Star — another New York-Miami service.

For passengers, it will be the end of the freshly prepared meals aboard. No more eggs over easy or the favorite Railroad French toast. No more steak cooked to their liking. Travelers will no longer need to make reservations for the breakfast, lunch and dinner service hours.

Passengers in roomettes and bedrooms, considered premium riders, will have the choice to have meals delivered to their rooms. If desired, they will be able to use a new version of a dining car, open exclusively to them, with booths, but no white linens. Eventually, Amtrak said, it may get rid of the booths altogether and create a more contemporary lounge setting.

The new menu offers a variety of prepackaged meals; for example, red wine braised beef and chicken fettuccine. In the morning, passengers will be able to pick up a pastry and coffee from a buffet-style continental breakfast.

Coach riders will eventually be able to buy the meals offered to premium riders, but in the cafe car.

Wilander said the food standards aren’t taking a hit, but rather, he said, the meals will be more consistent while the ingredients remain of “high quality.” He said the process of preordering and preselecting meals will allow Amtrak to maintain tighter controls of inventory, resulting in savings.

The railroad anticipates the change will save it about $2 million a year.

Amtrak began testing boxed meals on its Crescent trains. Last year it eliminated full meals and introduced the “more contemporary” dining menu on the Capitol Limited (D.C.-Chicago) and Lake Shore Limited (Chicago-New York). Since then it has tweaked the menu based on customer feedback. Officials, learned, for example, that the public’s perception of food boxes wasn’t as favorable as it hoped, and that passengers wanted more hot food options.

So, as it expands the new dining concept, there will be five prepackaged hot meal choices and no boxes. Eventually, Wilander said, riders will be able to pick their meal online, ahead of their trip.

The new dining options are part of Amtrak’s larger vision for long-distance trains. In coming months it will be refreshing train interiors, replacing old cloth-covered seats with faux leather cushions that provide lumbar support. It will update bedding, towels and linens for sleeping cars, and debut new Viewliner II sleeping cars for trains on the East Coast, the first addition to its sleeper fleet in more than 25 years.

“We haven’t forgotten the long distance,” said Roger Harris, executive vice president of marketing and revenue, citing improvements he said will enhance the overnight travel experience.

But the decision to scrap the traditional dining car has drawn criticism from rail aficionados, and inspired a change.org petition — signed by about 400 people as of Thursday — urging the railroad to keep the dining car service on all long-distance trains.

These travelers say the dining car is iconic to the rail experience. While it has changed over the decades, becoming more casual with the transition from fancy china to disposable plastic plates and bowls, it remains a favorite of many.

Keely’s mother, Sherrie Keely, who grew up traveling by train, said she still remembers the days when Amtrak had cloth napkins, flowers on the table and a little silver teapot.

“It is probably one of the few places that you can travel and sit down and talk to people,” she said. While some may find the prepackaged meals convenient, she says they encourage people to seclude themselves in their roomettes and discourage one-on-one time with other travelers at the dining table.

“Of course with those boxed lunches there is no waiting time in between,” she said. That takes away the quiet time to sit down and enjoy a meal with friends.

Her son Harrison took his first Amtrak trip when he was a baby in a stroller.

The memories of every trip — from the 1996 trip to his grandparents’ 50th wedding anniversary in Philadelphia to this summer’s trip to Washington for his grandmother’s 93rd birthday — all include a meal in the dining car.

“When I was a kid, I loved having the Railroad French toast for breakfast on Amtrak. . . . My favorite meal aboard Amtrak now is the crab cake,” he said. “It comes with a steak, but I don’t eat much red meat, so I give it to another diner at the table. Recently another diner offered to order the same thing and swapped with me so I could have two crab cakes.”

But his fondness for the dining car isn’t about the food as much as the experience, he said. The time to sit down for a formal meal with views of America that can’t be seen while flying, and socializing with other travelers.

“It’s just an amazing American tradition,” Keely said.

“There’s a beautiful rhythm in clacking down the tracks and an excitement in traversing a moving train,” he said. “There’s something that feels special, unique, romantic even about having dinner in the diner, sleeping on the tracks and traveling America the way it used to be seen.”

Most of the buzz surrounding the release over the weekend of the latest gold-standard Iowa poll from Ann Selzer (for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom) involved the candidates who have long been at the top of the heap. In particular, Selzer showed Elizabeth Warren (22 percent) moving ahead of Joe Biden (20 percent), and having double the level of support as third-place Bernie Sanders (11 percent). No other candidate was in double figures, and fourth-placed Pete Buttigieg (9 percent) lost six points since the last Iowa poll in June. So the bottom line was continued churn among the Big Three, with Warren showing the most momentum, but with not much shaking lower on the long list of candidates.

But Selzer also compiled favorable/unfavorable ratios for the candidates, and a look at them may help to discern which of today’s bottom-feeders have true dark horse potential, and which are probably going nowhere fast. Nine active candidates have positive net favorability numbers among likely caucus-goers:

Warren +58 Buttigieg +56 Harris +39 Booker +38 Biden +37 Klobuchar +30 O’Rourke +28 Sanders +22 Yang +6

But nine others are underwater:

Castro -1 Bennet -3 Bullock -5 Gabbard -5 Steyer -5 Sestak -14 Ryan -15 Delaney -17 Williamson -39

Two of the candidates with net negative favorability ratings (Castro and Steyer) have qualified for the October debates, and one other (Gabbard) is one qualifying poll away from making the stage with eight days left before the deadline.

Yes, this is just one poll from one state, albeit a highly regarded poll from the single-most important state, but it provides some evidence that below the Big Three are five who are making enough of a positive impression on Iowa Democrats that a late surge isn’t at all out of the question. And actually, all of the those five have higher net favorability numbers than Bernie Sanders, which increases the bad news he got from Selzer.

Not many pollsters offer favorability/unfavorability ratings for the entire field, but one national tracking poll that does, Morning Consult, offers a somewhat different take, from findings collected just after the September debate. It shows only one candidate, Marianne Williamson, having an underwater favorability ratio (-6). Here’s the rest of the field (Morning Consult didn’t bother to poll Joe Sestak):

Sanders +59 Biden +54 Warren +52 Harris +38 Buttigieg +33 O’Rourke +31 Booker +30 Yang +22 Klobuchar +21 Castro +11 Gabbard +11 Steyer +8 Bennet +6 Bullock +6 Delaney +3 Ryan +1

The rankings are pretty similar, with the exception of a big difference of opinion over Bernie Sanders (the most popular candidate nationally, per MC, but only the eighth most popular in Iowa, per Selzer), and some less dramatic divergences over candidates in the middle of the pack like Yang and Klobuchar (much more popular, unsurprisingly, in next-door Iowa).

At this point you’d have to figure October-debate non-qualifiers Bennet, Bullock, Delaney, Ryan, and Sestak are pretty toasty, with possible qualifier Gabbard and qualifiers Castro and Steyer not looking so hot, either. Yang’s on the bubble, as is Klobuchar, though her relative strength in Iowa could keep her aloft. But if you’re looking for a dark horse at this point, it’s probably going to be from the group that includes Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, and O’Rourke. So in your mental road-map of the race you should probably add a Little Four to the Big Three. And if Cory Booker’s campaign isn’t bluffing in its recent distress signal about fundraising, the list of plausible dark horses could soon shrink further."

With just over a week to go before qualifying ends for the fourth Democratic presidential candidate debate, to be held in October, the Democratic National Committee has announced new, higher qualifications for its November debate (place and time still TBD). Since every candidate who qualified for the September event in Houston automatically made the cut for October, this could be the first “winnowing” measure in a good while.

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states. While the new thresholds could distort fundraising efforts for more marginal candidates, it’s unlikely any of those on the October stage will fall off in November because of fundraising — unless they just run out of money and drop out of the race (as Cory Booker’s campaign has said might happen to him if it doesn’t reach its third-quarter money goals).

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems. There have been only three qualifying debates so far: two national surveys (NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Fox News) and one from Iowa (Ann Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom). Booker has met the new threshold in two of them; Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and Andrew Yang have met it in one. October debate qualifier Tom Steyer and possible qualifier Tulsi Gabbard haven’t met any so far; nor have the other candidates who failed to qualify for September.

The new higher but narrower qualifying option for early-state polls is probably tailor-made for Steyer, who can just pick a state or two and spend tens of millions of dollars on ads there. It could also help Klobuchar, who’s predictably doing better in Iowa than she is nationally or in other early states.

All in all, the new qualifying thresholds are mostly of interest to those who are shrieking in anguish at the likely reappearance of a second debate night in October. The odds are reasonably good that at least one or two October qualifiers won’t make it past the higher thresholds and will put the debate stage far beyond reach of the bottom-feeders who stubbornly refuse to drop out. Maybe for its next debate, in December, the DNC could help us out by administering a lie-detector test to see which candidates really believe they have a prayer of finishing in the top six or so in Iowa."

While she has touted her education at Howard University and raised her experience being bused to school as a young girl, her presidential campaign has stressed universality and inclusion. Her “3 a.m. agenda"" has stressed that what keeps us up at night — medical bills, housing, our kids’ education — does not depend on whether one is a Republican or Democrat. She routinely states that “we have so much more in common than what separates us.”

That reticence, by necessity, has receded. Voters demand a level of candor and intimacy from their presidential candidates. To both define her message and defend her record, she has had to explain her tenure as a prosecutor and rebutted claims that she was a cog in the machine of mass incarceration. She’s been obliged to share stories of her experience as a prosecutor comforting mothers whose children have been shot and killed and in instituting anti-bias training for police officers.

Moreover, as the campaign has progressed, Harris has more overtly emphasized her connection to the African American community and posited herself as African Americans’ advocate in the halls of power. This was especially noticeable in her speech Saturday. She spoke of herself as standing on the shoulders of African American giants such as Thurgood Marshall and told the crowd, “We need soldiers in every phase, layer and trench of the movement for social justice.” There is a need to pair outside advocacy with the hard and “frustrating” work of insiders, she argued. To sustain change and promote progress, she said, “We must elect and lift up people to lead who are also immersed in our community, who represent us and our experience, and who know the deep flaws within the systems we serve.” She added, “We need to run into the fire … extinguisher in hand.” In short, it matters for black Americans to have black Americans in power, on the inside.

Who better to knock down “the systemic barriers to racism,” she posits, than someone who understands that system but also has a deep understanding of the challenges facing the African American community as only a member of that community can? We now see her make the explicit case that the outcomes she obtained — e.g., getting jobs for young, low-level drug offenders — were a reflection of her understanding and attachment to the African American community.

For Harris, the address marked a level of candor and earnestness about her identity as an accomplished, African American woman that we have not regularly seen on the trail. In a time of “overt racism,” she presented herself “as only the second black woman elected to the United States Senate and as a serious and top-tier candidate for the president of the United States.”

AD

One can be cynical and say she is more vividly identifying as an African American candidate with an eye toward the critical South Carolina primary and the need to win over African American voters who heavily favor former vice president Joe Biden. However, it would be foolish for Harris to ignore her own identity, her own career and her own experience as she asks voters to take a chance on a first-time candidate for president, a woman still in her first term in the Senate.

All presidential candidates must personalize themselves. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) talks about her Okie upbringing on the “ragged edge” of the middle class. Biden is ""Middle-Class Joe,” and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is the gal from the heartland. Perhaps in fully inhabiting her role as an African American female trailblazer and a progressive insider, Harris’s will find the focus and clarity she needs.

The dam is bursting, the floodgates are opening, the horse is out of the barn. Choose whichever metaphor you want — the point is that news of President Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden has supercharged Democratic support for impeachment proceedings — to the point that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon.

What stands out about the latest crop of converts to the cause is how many are from swing congressional districts — the kinds of places where bringing charges against the president may be a far riskier political gamble than in safe Democratic areas, given that impeachment has consistently lacked majority support in national polls. The lack of enthusiasm from representatives in these districts is one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been so unenthusiastic about triggering the procedure over Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction in the Russia investigation.

But the Ukraine story seems to be different. Here’s a running list of lawmakers joining the impeachment push.

House Democrats Newly in Favor of Impeachment

At least 20 House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment for the first time in just the past two days, bringing the total number of representatives on board to 174 Democrats out of 235, according to Politico’s running counter.

On Monday, Congresswoman Angie Craig, who represents a Minnesota district Trump carried by a point, said she is onboard with impeachment.

Later that night, seven freshman Democrats wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which they deemed Trump’s actions a possible threat to national security. Four of them — Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria, Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill — represent districts Trump carried in 2016.

Here's how Trump did in the Impeachment 7 op-ed writers' districts in 2016:



Spanberger VA-7 Trump +7

Slotkin MI-8 Trump +7

Luria VA-2 Trump +4

Sherrill NJ-11 Trump +1

Cisneros CA-39 Clinton +9

Crow CO-6 Clinton +9

Houlahan PA-6 Clinton +10



AVG: Clinton +1 — Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) September 24, 2019

On Tuesday morning, New York’s Antonio Delgado joined the impeachment bandwagon. Delgado defeated incumbent Republican John Faso in an upstate district that voted for Trump by more than six points.

Some lawmakers appeared to be shifting on impeachment, but didn’t endorse it outright — yet. Texas’s Colin Allred said if the Trump administration doesn’t turn over the full report of the whistle-blower who alerted the government to Trump’s alleged misconduct, he would support impeachment. In 2018, Allred defeated a longtime Republican incumbent in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton by just two points.

Later, Texas representative Lizzie Fletcher announced her support as well. Fletcher’s district narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 but hadn’t been represented by a Democrat in Congress since 1967.

The facts we have learned recently are matters of utmost importance for our national security, country, and Constitution. The House should act swiftly to investigate and should be prepared to use the remedy exclusively in its power: impeachment.

Two representatives from Nevada, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, followed suit.

Lee’s district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016.

Haley Stevens of Michigan, who won a district that Trump carried by five points, wrote that “if investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offenses that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Also on Tuesday, civil-rights icon John Lewis announced his support for impeachment from the House floor.

Breaking. Rep. John Lewis just now on the House floor: ""I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy."" — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 24, 2019

Other Democrats who joined the herd include New York’s Joe Morelle and Michigan’s Debbie Dingell, Tennessee’s Jim Cooper, and Florida’s Donna Shalala and Lois Frankel, Pennsylvania’s Susan Wild, and Iowa’s Cindy Axne.

As a rough measure of swing-district support, just five Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016 had endorsed impeachment before this week, according to Politico; now that number is up to 13 and is likely to rise.

These lawmakers’ decisions were apparently not triggered by House leadership in any way, making them all the more significant.

As one Dem operative notes, this is the opposite of how Hill votes usually pile up: there is NO whipping from leadership, it’s rank and file members coordinating w one another, swallowing and stepping out there. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

While most of the action was in the House on Tuesday, the Democrats’ second-in-command in the Senate, Dick Durbin, joined in as well.

Today, I am calling for the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives of President Donald Trump. — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) September 24, 2019

Non-Democrats in Favor of Impeachment

So far, only one non-Democrat in Congress supports impeachment: Michigan representative Justin Amash, who switched his party registration from Republican to Independent earlier this year after declaring that Trump should be investigated. On Tuesday, he reiterated his call to action in an effort to nudge his erstwhile Republican colleagues.

Just do what is right. Stop waiting for others to act first. Take responsibility for yourself and set an example. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 24, 2019

There is no sign that any House Republicans will join Amash.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has appeared surprisingly eager to cooperate with Democrats, at least on the narrow matter of getting to the bottom of what the whistleblower actually said.

MCCONNELL has hotlined the resolution calling for the release of the whistleblower report. Schumer asking for unanimous consent for its passsage. — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019

One Republican, Mitt Romney, has expressed serious consternation over Trump’s behavior.

If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019

When asked about impeachment on Tuesday — hours after Trump had mocked him on Twitter — Romney didn’t rule it out.

Romney on impeachment: “it’s early to be having those conversations. There’s so much we don’t know” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 24, 2019

Some other Republicans, like Marco Rubio, have downplayed the allegations against Trump.

Democratic Presidential Candidates in Favor of Impeachment

Of the major presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, and Tom Steyer have previously called on Congress to impeach Trump. Pete Buttigieg has said Trump “deserves impeachment” but has stopped short of endorsing it. Bernie Sanders had also avoided a full-throated endorsement until Tuesday:

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.



Enough is enough.



I hope the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House will begin the impeachment process. pic.twitter.com/WHth62v5br — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Joe Biden, who is at the center of the Ukraine scandal, has so far resisted calls to impeach. But on Tuesday, he said that if the Trump administration does not cooperate with Democrats’ demands for full access to the whistle-blower’s complaint, he’s on board.

Joe Biden: If Pres. Trump doesn't give Congress documents on Ukraine, Trump will leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy ""of his own making.”



""We know who Donald Trump is. It is time to let the world know who we are."" — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 24, 2019

Other candidates are reaffirming their belief that Trump should face charges.

The House must impeach. It must start today. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 24, 2019

Enough. It’s time to impeach. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019

Never before have I seen Democratic candidates do so much to woo workers and win over union leaders. Elizabeth Warren kicked off her campaign at the site of the famous 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julián Castro marched in Durham, North Carolina, with fast-food workers demanding a $15 wage, while Pete Buttigieg spoke outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco alongside drivers demanding to be considered employees. Joe Biden held his first official campaign event at a Teamsters union hall in Pittsburgh. Kamala Harris has called for a raise averaging $13,500 for the nation’s schoolteachers, while Bernie Sanders has bolstered labor’s cause by using his email lists to urge supporters to join union picket lines.

Why all this sudden attention and affection for workers and unions — far more than I’ve ever seen during my nearly 25 years of writing about labor? Part of it is that this year’s Democratic candidates are doing what any smart politician would do when the field is so large — court one of the party’s largest constituencies, i.e., unions and their members. Part of it is that the candidates see that something is seriously broken in our economy: that income inequality, corporate profits, and the stock market have all been soaring while wages have largely stagnated for decades. Also, Democrats realize that a big reason Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 was that she didn’t show enough love to labor. The field seems to recognize that if a Democrat is going to win the presidency in 2020, the surest route is to win back the three longtime union strongholds — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that were key to Donald Trump’s victory. So the candidates have loosed a flood of pro-worker ideas, not just to make it easier to unionize, but to extend paid sick days and family leave to all workers, provide protections to pregnant workers, and safeguard LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination on the job.

Four of them — Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rouke, Pete Buttigieg, and Cory Booker — have put forward remarkably detailed platforms of pro-worker and pro-union proposals, while Elizabeth Warren’s elaborate plan on trade goes far beyond what many union leaders have called for. Andrew Yang says his universal basic income will be a boon for workers, providing a lifeline to those who lose their jobs because of artificial intelligence and robots. Biden has been vague so far on labor matters, calling himself a union man and saying he supports a $15 minimum. Booker has introduced a fairly radical bill, the Worker Dividend Act, which would require corporations that do stock buybacks to pay out to their employees a sizable chunk of the money going to the buyback.

Considering how many candidates there are and how many proposals and speeches they’ve made, it’s hard to keep track of who stands for what — and which plans are substantively the most pro-labor. Below, I give grades to the Democratic front-runners, based not just on the positions they’ve espoused during the campaign, but also on their track records. (Some candidates seem to have discovered the cause of workers only after announcing that they were running for the presidency.)

I confess to one bias in grading the candidates. In my new book, Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor, I write that union power and worker power in the U.S. have fallen to their weakest point since World War II, and that this has fueled wage stagnation, out-of-control income inequality and a warped political system in which corporations and billionaire donors have far too much sway and workers far too little. In grading, I give extra points to candidates who are pushing or proposing strategies to fix this systemic problem and give American workers more power — in the workplace, in politics, and in policymaking.

Some will complain that the grades I give are too high, but it is important to remember that when it comes to worker issues, every Democratic candidate is head and shoulders above almost every Republican lawmaker. Republicans overwhelmingly oppose a higher minimum wage and basic protections like paid sick days, seeming to dread displeasing corporate donors and lobbyists. Most Republicans favor weakening labor unions, not strengthening them. Moreover, the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation, has given the Democratic candidates’ high scores for their career legislative records: Cory Booker (100), Kamala Harris (100), Bernie Sanders (98), Elizabeth Warren (98), Julian Castro (96), Amy Klobuchar (95), Beto O’Rourke (94). Of the candidates, Joe Biden has the lowest AFL-CIO score (86), based on when he left the Senate in 2009. Some labor experts say that in the highly polarized Congress, in which Republicans are often seeking to undermine unions, it’s not hard for Democrats to garner high AFL-CIO ratings. Still, this year’s progressive crop of candidates supports many bills that would go far to help union and workers, like the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would make it easier to unionize, and the Healthy Families Act, which would require most companies to provide full-time workers with seven paid sick days a year.

A

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has fought for workers ever since he entered Congress in 1991, introducing the Workplace Democracy Act in 1992, and reintroducing it in every Congress since. That bill would make it easier for workers to unionize by, among other things, giving them a right to do so as soon as a majority of workers sign pro-union cards rather than through a lengthy election process that strongly favors employers.

Sanders didn’t suddenly start joining union picket lines this year. In 2015, he marched alongside Verizon workers as well as workers picketing outside their potato-starch factory in Cedar Rapids. Sanders told those workers in Iowa, “We are sick and tired of the war against working families.” In this election cycle, Sanders has already won the endorsement of the United Electrical Workers, a small union with 35,000 members.

The labor platform that Sanders has announced this year envisions doubling union membership in four years. It is a dream list for the nation’s unions. Sanders wants to strengthen workers’ clout through legislation that promotes industry-wide bargaining (instead of employer-by-employer bargaining). He would prohibit awarding federal contracts to companies that pay less than $15 an hour; he would also ban right-to-work laws, allow all government employees to unionize, and prohibit employers from permanently replacing workers who go on strike. In perhaps his most radical proposal, Sanders calls for ending America’s at-will employment system — he would prohibit employers from firing workers except for “just cause.”

Sanders’s platform for a Green New Deal has helped lead the way in reassuring unions upset with climate-change activists; he has called for a “just transition” for fossil-fuel workers who lose their jobs if and when the nation shutters coal-fired power plants and takes other actions to slow global warming. Sanders would guarantee those workers five years of current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pensions support, and “priority job replacement for any displaced worker.”

Sanders has loudly opposed free-trade agreements. His repeated calls for Medicare for All have cheered many workers and some labor leaders, even as Joe Biden has attacked Medicare for All, saying it would take away the excellent health coverage won by many unions.

Sanders’s supporters argue that he has long been the most pro-labor of the candidates, but others point out that for all his pro-worker rhetoric, he has racked up few concrete victories for workers. Sanders counters that he has led the way on, for example, legislation protecting IBM workers’ pensions and doubling home-heating assistance to help low-income workers. Sanders has been Congress’ most outspoken champion of a $15 minimum wage, and is often given credit for helping persuade Jeff Bezos to boost the base wage at Amazon to that level.

A

Elizabeth Warren

Warren doesn’t have a pro-labor record stretching back decades, but she has been a remarkable fount of innovative, pro-worker ideas. Some union officials told me that her proposal on trade was by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker. Criticizing the U.S. for long pursuing “a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers,” Warren has proposed using trade agreements as a tool “to force other countries to raise the bar on everything from labor and environmental standards to anti-corruption rules.” Asserting that corporate lobbyists have long whispered into the ears of our trade negotiators, Warren has called for a far more transparent process and proposed that worker, environmental, and consumer representatives sit on committees that advise America’s trade negotiators.

Warren’s “Plan for Economic Patriotism” is far more thoughtful than anything Trump has developed to encourage and bring back manufacturing jobs. She calls for leveraging federal R&D to spur investment and job creation, noting that Apple has used technologies developed through federally sponsored R&D to produce tens of millions of iPhones overseas. To aid depressed communities, Warren says, “R&D investments should be spread across every region of the country, not focused on only a few coastal cities.” To boost the job prospects of young Americans who don’t go to college, she has proposed a tenfold increase — a total of $20 billion over ten years — for apprenticeship programs.

In a daring proposal, Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act would give labor far more voice in the economy by letting workers elect 40 percent of the board members of large American corporations. Her path-breaking work to create the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been a boon to working families, helping prevent banks from imposing extortionate fees and helping keep payday lenders from preying on down-on-their-luck workers.

As Blue Compass, a political and opposition research firm, makes clear, week after week Warren has done far more on social media than other candidates to go to bat for unions, for instance, doing videos on behalf of Las Vegas hotel workers seeking a contract. Amid concerns that Medicare for All might hurt some union members, Warren has pledged to include labor leaders in all Medicare for All discussions. “Strengthening America’s labor unions will be a central goal of my administration,” Warren told In These Times. She recently won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which had endorsed Sanders in 2016.

Last Monday, at her rally in Washington Square that attracted 20,000 New Yorkers, Warren spoke movingly and at length about the 1911 Triangle Fire, about the 146 Triangle workers who died, and about the brilliant efforts, led by Frances Perkins, who later served as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor, to prevent more such factory disasters — and to improve conditions overall for America’s workers.

Pete Buttigieg

Mayor Pete’s platform on labor, A New Rising Tide, is one of the very best things I’ve read from any modern-day politician on worker issues. He sees much injustice in the workplace: that Uber misclassifies workers as independent contractors to deny them basic worker protections, that the McDonald’s franchising model undermines workers’ ability to unionize, that Google hires so many temps and independent contractors to undermine workers’ bargaining power. “The hard truth is that while the economy changed, workers’ voices” have been “systematically silenced,” Buttigieg writes. “Our economy has been tilted towards the wealthy and away from the middle and working class because the people in power designed our laws and policies that way.”

Buttigieg’s platform would raise the federal minimum wage to $15, end right-to-work laws, give workers the power to unionize through card check, guarantee paid sick leave and family leave, ban the use of permanent replacement workers, and take strong steps to curb corporations’ often-intimidating sway over unionization elections.

Union officials in Indiana say that Buttigieg, though just 37, is not a Johnny-come-lately in supporting labor. He sided with labor unions when Indiana Republicans sought to repeal the state’s “common construction wage law,” which helped assure higher wages for construction workers. Buttigieg also signed a labor-backed “responsible bidding” ordinance that requires businesses seeking city contracts with South Bend to disclose OSHA violations.

“He’s been fantastic,” Jim Gardner, an official with the Operating Engineers union told In These Times. Buttigieg’s unsuccessful campaign for state treasurer in 2010 was run out of the offices of South Bend’s building trades unions.

Joe Biden

Biden was the first candidate to secure a union endorsement, receiving it from the 320,000-member International Association of Fire Fighters. Its longtime president, Harold Schaitberger, lavished praise on his friend, saying, “He’s one of the staunchest advocates for working families. He knows that a strong middle class means a strong America.”

Nonetheless, Biden faces many questions from unions. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and while President Obama was considered pro-union, he negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Biden supported that agreement, and many unions deride it to this day, even after Trump pulled out of the agreement.

At his campaign’s official kickoff event at a Teamsters hall, Biden trumpeted, “I make no apologies. I am a union man.” Some union leaders were nonetheless upset that on the day Biden announced his candidacy — three days before the Teamsters hall event — he spoke at a high-dollar Philadelphia fundraiser organized by a senior executive at Comcast. Patrick Eiding, the president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, complained that the “first place he goes” is to a Comcast executive’s. “No connection with labor,” Eiding said. “It was a little disturbing.” One labor scholar, writing in May, said he could find only two instances when Biden appeared on a picket line, “once in Iowa, during his 1987 presidential campaign and just this month (May) in Boston,” backing the Stop and Shop supermarket strikers.

As a senator, Biden supported organized labor’s No. 1 priority, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it easier to unionize by, among other things, giving unions a right to use card check. At a forum sponsored by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in August, Biden spoke robustly for labor, decrying “an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits.”

The labor platform that Biden has sketched out so far is short, indeed abbreviated. He supports a $15 minimum wage, curbing noncompete clauses, easing occupational licensing requirements, and making it easier for workers to unionize and bargain (without spelling out how). None of this is the fight-like-hell stuff one might expect from someone who characterizes himself as a champion of labor.

B

Cory Booker

Booker has pushed some daring, unorthodox ideas to help workers. One is the Worker Dividend Act, a Senate bill he sponsored that would help workers share in a company’s profits by requiring corporations that do stock buybacks to pay their employees either an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the buyback or half of all profits above $250 million. Booker has also proposed a job guarantee that would give 15 cities or rural areas federal money so they can guarantee jobs to everyone who wants one. Economists say this pilot measure would go far to help marginal, struggling workers.

Booker has a reputation for being close to Wall Street — he defended Bain Capital when Barack Obama attacked it during the 2012 campaign, and received $2.2 million from the securities and investment industry, more than any other senator, during the 2013 to 2014 election cycle. Nonetheless, his record on worker rights and unions is progressive — he backs a $15 minimum wage and bills that would make it easier to unionize, including Sanders’s Workplace Democracy Act and the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Last Wednesday, Booker beefed up his labor bona fides by releasing an elaborate platform called “Opportunity and Justice for Workers.” In it, Booker says, “For most people in this country, our economy is broken.” His platform calls for sweeping new laws to make it easier to unionize, raise workers’ wages, and ease work-life balance.

Teachers’ unions have long been uneasy with Booker because he championed vouchers and charter schools as Newark’s mayor. Labor leaders complain that these moves siphon money from traditional public schools and undermine teachers’ unions. The Newark Teachers Union opposed Booker’s 2010 reelection as mayor. But Booker argues that that teachers’ union often obstructed moves to improve educational quality in Newark’s struggling schools. At a union forum in August, Booker said he would prioritize public schools and noted that the New Jersey Education Association, his state’s largest teachers’ union, had endorsed him as a Senate candidate.

B

Julián Castro

Castro has been the most outspoken candidate on behalf of immigrants, but his platform has been thin on worker and labor issues. (Vox’s labor reporter wrote that Castro “probably has the weakest labor platform” on worker issues.) He met with striking University of California medical workers and attended a meeting of campus workers at Stanford, his alma mater, to show support before they began contract negotiations with the university. (California’s early primary is especially important for Castro’s prospects.) He has spoken at various union audiences, but he hasn’t made lifting up workers a central theme of his campaign. Castro backs numerous measures that would help working families, including universal child care, paid family leave, and a $15 minimum wage.

B

Kamala Harris

Unlike Sanders, Booker, Buttigieg, and O’Rourke, Kamala Harris has not adopted a plan that shouts to the world that she is eager to expand unions. She has taken a different, sometimes innovative course. She has trumpeted a plan that would lift the pay of the nation’s public school teachers by $13,500 on average, a move that has delighted two of the nation’s largest and most powerful unions: the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. In July, Harris introduced legislation for a National Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights, which would help the nation’s nannies, housekeepers and caregivers by giving them minimum wage and overtime protections and paid time off and requiring their employers to give them written employment contracts. To reduce income inequality, Harris has introduced a bill called LIFT the Middle Class Act that would give a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to households earning under $100,000 annually.

Harris uses social media to promote various union causes, such as organizing UCLA’s medical residents. But she has not made battling for unions and workers a signature part of her campaign the way Sanders and Warren have and has not issued a detailed labor platform.

B

Beto O’Rourke

O’Rourke’s labor platform, A 21st Century Labor Contract, is an impressive, thoughtful document. He calls for lifting workers collectively by expanding unions and their bargaining clout, while also calling for lifting workers individually, legislating new worker rights, by, for instance, guaranteeing seven paid sick days.

In his labor platform, O’Rourke proposes a nationwide law to let all government workers and farm workers unionize, and doing likewise for all frontline supervisors and independent contractors. (Letting frontline supervisors join unions would greatly expand union power, especially during strikes; letting independent contractors unionize and bargain would be a powerful tool for gig workers.) O’Rourke would adopt nationwide rules making it far easier for Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig workers to be considered employees — a move that would extend minimum wage and overtime coverage to them as well as protections against sexual harassment and race discrimination. O’Rourke would establish government-appointed wage boards that would set, and presumably improve, wages and conditions for industries with low union membership — for instance, fast-food restaurants, nail salons, carwashes.

Although from conservative Texas, O’Rourke has forcefully called for raising the minimum wage to $15 so workers don’t have to juggle two and three jobs. Some labor advocates point out, with chagrin, that when O’Rourke was on the El Paso City Council in 2010, he questioned whether police and firefighters should have a right to bargain collectively. At the time, El Paso faced a large budget deficit due to the recession, and city officials wanted municipal unions to agree to defer their raises. O’Rourke was angry that the police union continued to insist on wage increases that he said amounted to 8 percent. At one point, O’Rourke even asked the city’s attorney whether there was a way to eliminate the police union. In a 2011 interview, he said, “I do not think it is in the community’s best interests, certainly not in the taxpayers’ best interests, to have collective bargaining by the police and firefighters.”

But more recently, O’Rourke has championed the right of all public-sector workers, including police officers to unionize, telling a union meeting in Houston in July, “We’ve seen the devastation in our communities and in our states when unions are not allowed to organize … As president, I want to make sure that we guarantee the right to organize for every educator and public servant in every state.”

B-

Amy Klobuchar

Klobuchar has “one of the vaguest labor platforms” of the Democratic candidates, Vox wrote recently. She often tells audiences that she is the daughter of a unionized teacher and newspaperman and granddaughter of a unionized iron ore miner. She says that “as President she’ll stand up against attempts to weaken unions,” adding, without offering details, that she wants to reform labor laws, protect collective bargaining rights and roll back right-to-work laws. In her first 100 days as president, she says, she will issue executive orders requiring federal contractors to pay at least $15 an hour, scrapping Trump’s rollback of overtime protections, and banning companies from requiring low-wage workers to sign noncompete clauses.

Despite her impressive rhetorical and debating skills, Klobuchar is not much of a fighter for workers — her focus is usually elsewhere — and this from a lawmaker whose state has a famous farm-labor tradition and has sent several warriors for workers to the Senate, most recently Paul Wellstone. Some former Klobuchar aides have said she can be an abusive boss. Based on interviews with ex-staffers, The New York Times wrote that Klobuchar was “not just demanding but often dehumanizing” and “not merely a tough boss,” but “the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.” Considering this, that’s all the more reason Klobuchar should be working doubly hard to show she is a champion of workers.

Andrew Yang

Yang talks as if his universal basic income program (which would guarantee $1,000 a month to every citizen over the age of 18) would be a boon for America’s workers. He says it would be a welcome supplement for low-wage and part-time workers and a lifeline to laid-off workers, helping them avoid misery and easing the pressure on them to take whatever job is offered them, no matter how low the pay. He says UBI would increase workers’ bargaining power “because a guaranteed, unconditional income gives them leverage to say no to exploitative wages and abusive working conditions” UBI would help workers who are on strike, Yang says, by enabling them to hold out longer and demand a better contract.

To my mind, Yang’s single issue — Yang calls it a “Freedom Dividend” — hardly begins to address, much less fix, the biggest problems American workers face: soaring income inequality and the overall decline of worker power. Some experts argue that UBI would encourage some employers to lower workers’ pay.

In a Labor Day blog post last year, Yang seemed to have only just discovered the importance of labor unions and collective worker action — he was marveling at the historic achievements of Walter Reuther, the UAW, and other unions, and how they played a pivotal role in building the world’s largest and richest middle class. In Yang’s platform, there is little acknowledgement of what collective action or unions have achieved and can achieve for American workers. (He inaccurately says union membership has dropped 70 percent from its peak; it’s dropped 30 percent.)

Many people I respect support UBI, especially to help the millions of workers who some predict will lose their jobs because of AI, robots, and other new technologies. I nonetheless wonder how will laid-off workers survive on $12,000 a year, especially when some supporters of UBI have called for weakening various parts of the social safety net. As far as I can tell, Yang — who is very eloquent in discussing the threat that new technologies pose to workers — has hardly discussed a key issue: the importance of giving workers (and not just corporate executives, technology gurus, and Silicon Valley investors) a voice in what new technologies will mean for workers and the economy. I fear that UBI, combined with technology-induced layoffs, will create an underclass of the long-term unemployed scraping by on $12,000 a year, and an overclass of very wealthy executives and investors who own and control the new technologies.

Donald Trump

Trump campaigned as a champion of workers, but his administration is unarguably the most anti-worker, anti-union administration since Ronald Reagan — and is arguably even more anti-worker. Trump and his appointees have taken dozens of actions to hurt workers. They have rolled back overtime protections extended to millions of workers and scrapped the “fiduciary rule” requiring Wall Street firms to act in workers’ best interests in handling 401k’s. His administration has reduced the number of OSHA inspectors and weakened safety requirements for oil-rig workers. Trump has made it easier to award federal contracts to corporations that have repeatedly violated minimum wage and overtime laws, race and sex discrimination laws, and laws protecting workers’ ability to unionize. His administration has hurt LGBTQ+ workers by urging the Supreme Court to rule that they are not covered by federal anti-discrimination laws.

Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, has long been corporate America’s top gun, its leading lawyer, in seeking to quash many new regulations protecting workers. Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, Neil Gorsuch, provided the pivotal vote in important cases that weakened public-sector unions and let corporations prohibit workers from bringing class actions, making it far harder for millions of Americans to vindicate their workplace rights. Trump’s appointees to the National Labor Relations Board have been extremely aggressive in seeking to weaken unions and obstruct union organizing – for instance, declaring that Uber and Lyft drivers shouldn’t be classified as employees, making it far harder to unionize franchises like McDonald’s, and vastly reducing the ability of contracted-out workers to picket employers.

The only reason Trump deserves an F-plus and not an F is that he had made good on one big promise to workers — his vow to fight on trade. He has pushed to revamp NAFTA and confront China. But in renegotiating NAFTA, Trump failed to do the one thing labor unions said was most needed: to make sure that NAFTA’s enforcement mechanisms had teeth so that Mexican workers could push for higher wages and to unionize without being suppressed or jailed.

Moreover, Trump has hugely mishandled his trade war with China. Any child can tell you that if you’re going to pick a fight with a powerful adversary, you want your friends lined up at your side. But Trump launched his trade war against China, the world’s second largest economic power, without getting important allies like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Australia to fight along with us. As a result of Trump’s unilateral trade war, China is feeling much less pressure and America’s workers, farmers, consumers, and corporations are getting battered. Trump deserves a failing grade for the way he has so badly bungled his trade war.

The early state polling drought in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest really does seem to be ending. After this weekend’s gold-standard Selzer poll from Iowa, today we received results from high-quality polls in New Hampshire (Monmouth) and Nevada (USA Today/Suffolk).

The most immediate news in this mini-harvest of public opinion is that the Monmouth poll qualified a 12th candidate for the October Democratic debates in Ohio by taking 2 percent, Tulsi Gabbard now has met the four-poll 2 percent threshold. This development all but eliminates any doubts that this round of debates will again be a two-day affair, after the brief bliss of ten candidates fitting on the same stage in Houston earlier this month.

The same poll, though, continues a string of bad results for Bernie Sanders in terms of his standing in early states vis-à-vis his progressive rival Elizabeth Warren. Monmouth has Warren now edging Joe Biden in the Granite State by a 27-25 margin — but with Sanders down to 12 percent, just ahead of Pete Buttigieg with 10 percent. This is extremely similar to what Selzer found in Iowa (Warren 22 percent, Biden 20 percent, Sanders 11 percent, Buttigieg 9 percent). That makes any suspicion (based on an national poll in August showing Warren in a three-way tie with Biden and Sanders) that Monmouth is somehow putting a thumb on the scales for Warren a non-starter. The USA Today/Suffolk poll of Nevada shows Biden still in the lead with 23 percent, but Sanders at 14 percent is trailing Warren’s 19 percent by a significant margin. Indeed, as Nate Silver pointed out (a bit too avidly, you might say, but accurately), poor early state poll numbers for Sanders are becoming too routine for comfort:

This is a list Bernie Sanders' standing in all early- state polls since the Houston debate



IA: 9% (David Binder Research)

IA: 11% (Selzer)

NH: 12% (Monmouth)

NV: 14% (Suffolk)

IA: 16% (Civiqs) — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 24, 2019

As a reminder, Sanders won nearly half the vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2016, along with 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.

Like his fellow late-septuagenarian Joe Biden, Sanders is doing quite a bit better in national polls. The latest RealClearPolitics averages have Biden at 30 percent, Warren at 20 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent, with Buttigieg way back at 6 percent. But the trends aren’t great for Bernie. For months one of his bulwarks was the vast Morning Consult tracking poll. He’s now fallen behind Warren there, too.

Aside from the good news for Gabbard concerning the October debates, we are now in the window when selected polls will count toward qualification for the November debate, too. With today’s releases, there are now two national qualifying polls and three from the early states, with the threshold now up to a three percent showing in four national and/or early state polls, or 5 percent from two early state polls. The Big Three plus Buttigieg and Harris are hitting these thresholds routinely, but among the iffier candidates, it’s notable that Booker and Yang now have two qualifying polls, while Klobuchar, O’Rourke, and Steyer have just one (September debate participant Julian Castro has been skunked so far, as has Gabbard, whose qualifying number from Monmouth for October fell short of the November threshold).

We’re probably looking at a single night of debates in November, but the thing to watch is whether the current Big Three of Biden, Warren, and Sanders is looking more like a Big Two with Bernie slipping back and perhaps some other candidate coming on."

The 16-year-old has been open about being diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, embracing it as her “superpower.”

Amid the intense blowback over Knowles’s remarks Monday night after a clip of the show went viral, Fox News apologized to Thunberg.

“The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful — we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers,” a spokesperson for the network told The Washington Post in a statement.

Fox News also said it has “no plans” to book Knowles.

Knowles did not respond to a request for comment late Monday but defended himself on Twitter, writing: “There is nothing shameful about living with mental disorders. What is shameful is exploiting a child — particularly a child with mental disorders — to advance your political agenda.”

AD

Thunberg has called the condition a “gift” and credited it with sparking her activism.

“Some people mock me for my diagnosis. But Asperger is not a disease, it’s a gift. People also say that since I have Asperger I couldn’t possibly have put myself in this position. But that’s exactly why I did this,” she wrote on Facebook in February. “Because if I would have been ‘normal’ and social I would have organized myself in an organisation, or started an organisation by myself. But since I am not that good at socializing I did this instead. I was so frustrated that nothing was being done about the climate crisis and I felt like I had to do something, anything.”

AD

The network’s apology comes as conservatives have ramped up their broadsides against Thunberg, who traveled to the United States earlier this month on a solar-powered sailboat and has since been chastising powerful politicians about their inaction on climate change. In a widely reviled tweet over the weekend, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza compared Thunberg to young people featured in Nazi propaganda, sharing a photo of the Swedish teen alongside an illustration of a Caucasian girl sporting braided hair and holding a Nazi flag. On Monday, Sebastian Gorka, the former Breitbart editor and White House aide, labeled Thunberg as an “autist child.”

AD

Even President Trump weighed in late Monday with a tweet that many took as sarcastic.

“She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,” Trump tweeted shortly after 11:30 p.m., sharing a video of Thunberg delivering her fiery address at the U.N. climate summit. “So nice to see!”

Knowles made his statements about Thunberg while appearing on the “The Story with Martha MacCallum,” and his description of the teenager instantly sparked a rebuke from liberal radio host Christopher Hahn, who had also been invited on as a guest.

“How dare you?” Hahn could be heard interjecting.

When Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner, who was filling in for MacCallum, gave Hahn the floor, he tore into Knowles.

AD

“You’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child,” Hahn said. “Shame on you.”

The pair then began talking over each other as Knowles insisted he wasn’t going after Thunberg, but rather “attacking the left for exploiting a mentally ill child.”

“Now, relax, skinny boy,” Hahn barked, eliciting a noise of surprise from Faulkner and a chuckle from Knowles. “Have some couth when you’re on television. Maybe on your podcast you get away and say whatever you want because nobody’s listening. You’re on national television. Be a grown-up when you’re talking about children.”

AD

Hahn later added: “You are despicable for talking about her like that. You should apologize on national television right now.”

AD

Meanwhile, Knowles stuck to his talking point that Thunberg is “mentally ill,” pointing to a family memoir that recounted details from the teenager’s childhood.

“She has autism,” he said. “She has obsessive compulsive disorder. She has selective mutism. She had depression. Her mother wrote about this in a book.”

Ignoring Hahn’s barbs, Knowles told the radio host, “You can inveigh all you want, but unfortunately, you don’t have many facts on your side.”

The heated exchange, which lasted more than two minutes, quickly spread on social media Monday night. By early Tuesday, one video of the short segment had amassed more than 1.6 million views.

Critics denounced Knowles’s comments, which also drew swift backlash from autism advocacy organizations.

“To intentionally demean any person, regardless of neuro-diversity, is both cruel and wrong,” the Autism Society said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. “Certainly some might disagree with Ms. Thunberg on policy issues, but it is shameful to issue a derogatory statement to a youth advocate.”

Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, told THR that it is “absolutely unconscionable to attack someone for their disability, especially when that person is a child.”

“History is full of autistic people and people with other cognitive disabilities who were and are compelling, credible activists and leaders,” Bascom said. “Greta is a part of that tradition, and our community is lucky to have her. Period.”

AD

A Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about the polls to which Trump was referring.

AD

The list of Democrats calling for Trump’s impeachment has been bolstered in recent days by revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in a phone call that took place shortly after Trump had temporarily suspended military aid to the country.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to pressure a foreign power to hurt Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender. Trump has acknowledged he held back the aid, but denies doing anything improper. On Tuesday, he said he was concerned the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries. He has previously said he was worried about corruption in Ukraine.

AD

In surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.

AD

When matched against four other Democratic candidates — Sen. Warren Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — Trump did not have an advantage against any of them. At best he trailed within the range of sampling error.

Recent polling has also shown Trump without a clear lead against top Democrats in several of the mostly closely contested states in 2016.

AD

In Michigan, for instance, an EPIC-MRA poll in August asked whether registered voters would support Trump against four different Democratic candidates.

Trump trailed Biden by 10 points, a statistically significant edge. Warren and Sanders held slight edges over Trump of 4 points and 5 points, respectively, while Harris had a 3-point lead, which was within the margin of error.

In Wisconsin, a Marquette Law School poll in August found Trump tied or behind Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris among registered voters. Biden led Trump by 9 points; Sanders had a slight 4-point edge, while Warren and Harris were tied with Trump.

Elizabeth Warren: 22 percent Former vice president Joe Biden: 20 Sen. Bernie Sanders: 11 South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg: 9 Sen. Kamala D. Harris: 6 Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 3

With that big poll now public, here are some overarching questions for the broader 2020 race.

1. How much trouble is Bernie Sanders in (especially in Iowa)?

The big news this weekend was that Warren had overtaken Biden (albeit still within the margin of error) in the new poll. But that wasn’t all that far-fetched given Warren’s ascendancy.

Perhaps the second biggest piece of news in the poll was that Sanders’s Iowa troubles appear to be very real. We had seen some evidence of this before, but now it seems safe to say it. Of the last four live-caller polls in Iowa, Sanders is at 11 percent in this one and 9 percent in the three previous ones. He does better in online polls, but every high-quality poll has him lagging behind his national showing.

AD

AD

Why is that important? Because he nearly won the state in 2016, yet early signs suggest he’s not even an option for many voters there. Another poll last week showed more likely caucusgoers had ruled out supporting him (46 percent) than were considering it (43 percent.)

It’s also important because national polls still have them running neck and neck for second place. Given that both Sanders and Warren hail from a state that neighbors New Hampshire (Sanders from Vermont and Warren from Massachusetts), the one who finishes better in Iowa would seem to have the inside track ahead of the Granite State’s primary.

And if one of them drops out at that point, it could reshape the race.

AD

2. How will Elizabeth Warren wear?

Warren is the one candidate with demonstrated momentum pretty much throughout the 2020 race. Being in the lead in Iowa would seem to be the culmination of all that.

AD

But she’s thus far largely avoided her opponents’ fire, and that’s starting to change. She has also in the past struggled to deal with the controversy over her past claim of Native American heritage, muddling through efforts to put it behind her. Then there is the electability issue — however fair — when it comes to Democrats nominating another polarizing, intellectual woman, this time a former Harvard University professor from Massachusetts.

And for Warren and Sanders, their problem is that the NBC/WSJ poll shows their stances on some issues -- like single-payer -- are out of step with the rest of the country pic.twitter.com/uRwIKB6BsT — Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) September 23, 2019

It’s too easy to caricature Warren as an unelectable extremist. But Democratic voters are completely preoccupied with nominating someone — anyone — who can beat Trump. The same new Iowa poll shows twice as many emphasized that (63 percent) as emphasized agreement on the issues (31 percent).

AD

They seem to like Warren in a way they don’t like the others; her main task is persuading them to vote with their heart while believing in their minds that it will work out. The good news for her is she seems to be doing that, at least in Iowa, where she’s tied with Biden at 22 percent with electability-first voters.

AD

We’ll see if that holds — and if the rest of the country begins to agree.

3. Is Joe Biden’s electability edge ironclad?

Related to the point above: If Warren is the candidate of Democrats’ hearts, Biden is the choice of their minds. Nearly every poll shows he is viewed as the most electable. So if Democrats just want to win, he should be able to stick around.

AD

But just as we should challenge our assumptions about Warren’s electability deficit, we should challenge them about Biden’s electability edge.

Part of that is because Biden is the most well-known candidate in the race who is also easiest to see in the role of a president — in large part because he was right next to one for eight years. We shouldn’t discount how much this is because he’s simply the biggest known quantity in the field and thus makes the most sense for casual voters.

AD

It’s also worth questioning whether he’ll maintain that perception. Biden’s previous presidential runs haven’t gone well, and there have already been plenty of stumbles early in his 2020 campaign. It’s one thing to be the vice president whom people can see being president; it’s another to be the candidate who can’t quite shoot straight. If he can’t be as compelling or as steady as Warren or other candidates, perhaps Democrats will start to adjust their preconceptions about how he might fare in the general election.

AD

4. Is Biden’s black support sustainable?

A big reason Biden continues to lead in national polling — even as he doesn’t do as well in Iowa and New Hampshire — is black voters.

Even after tangling with Harris on busing and criticism from another black candidate, Sen. Cory Booker, about Biden’s comments about working with segregationist senators, Biden is still above 40 percent with African Americans in most polls. A recent poll of the South Carolina primary showed him taking 51 percent of that demographic there.

AD

This demographic advantage was huge for Hillary Clinton in 2016; Sanders’s inability to appeal to black voters basically made him unelectable in a party whose nominating process they play such a major role in (around one-quarter of all voters).

AD

As Philip Bump has written, black voters may not be the silver bullet for Biden that they were for Clinton. But it’s his most loyal demographic in the 2020 race right now, and it’s the one keeping him in the lead nationally. If he can maintain that through the early states and especially heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday, he’ll stand a good chance. If he can’t, the math becomes much more difficult.

5. What’s the deal with Pete Buttigieg?

We’ve talked about the first three candidates in that Iowa poll. The fourth one, though, is a major X-Factor.

AD

The new Iowa poll shows Buttigieg has the second-highest favorable rating in Iowa (behind Warren), at 69 percent. He also has the lowest unfavorable rating of anyone (Warren included), at 13 percent. People really like the guy. And so do donors, judging by Buttigieg’s surprise win in the second-quarter fundraising race.

AD

But the same Iowa voters who really like him also still have him in fourth place, at 9 percent — behind candidates they don’t like as much.

The easy and perhaps overly simplistic explanation is that maybe they like the South Bend, Ind., mayor — and quite a bit — but that they can’t necessarily see the boyish 37-year-old as their president or as being capable of beating Trump. An alternate explanation is that they are warm to him even if they haven’t quite been convinced. That suggests they could eventually come around, which is pretty much all he could ask at this point, given where he started this race.

There has been a lot of talk about how Buttigieg maybe hasn’t delivered on that fundraising. He seems to have plenty of upside, though. And the fact that he’s not alienating key voters is significant.

A confused reader passed along a tweet with a clip of these remarks. What was Biden talking about?

AD

After all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.

AD

Biden’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:

He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.

He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: “It’s going to cost you in your pay — there will be a deductible in your paycheck”).

He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not “5 percent and 4 percent.”

We understand politicians can misspeak — though Biden seems to do it more often than most — so we won’t be awarding Pinocchios. But the point he was trying to make gets to the heart of the debate about the cost of a single-payer health plan. So it’s worth exploring this issue and explaining it to readers, especially because more than 100,000 people watched the video embedded in the tweet.

AD

The Facts

Sanders, as Biden noted, has said his plan will raise taxes, but argues that the cost of health care will be lower overall. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), rising fast in the polls, has embraced Sanders’s plan but studiously avoids answering any questions about a possible tax increase. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) used to support the Sanders plan but then crafted her own version, in part because of what she called “a middle-class tax hike” embedded in the plan. Her plan would phase in much more slowly and still retain a role for private insurance.

AD

Biden has rejected a single-payer approach and advocated building on the Affordable Care Act, the law expanding health-care access passed during the Obama administration.

AD

Actually, no one really knows what would happen. You have to take any of the numbers offered by advocates and detractors with a huge grain of salt. As we have documented before, the cost of any health-care proposal will be affected by a variety of factors, including provider payments, health-care benefits, cost-sharing and administrative savings from a consolidated system. Any complex bill overhauling health care faces daunting prospects in a closely divided Congress.

But for the sake of argument, let’s look at the numbers Biden and Sanders are using.

Sanders has offered a menu of possible options to finance the cost of Medicare-for-all. One option would require a 7.5 percent payroll tax that employers would pay to help fund the program. Another would be a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households. (That’s what Harris labeled a middle-class tax hike.)

AD

AD

But Sanders argues that those taxes would be cheaper than the current system.

Sanders offers as an example a prototypical family of four earning $50,000. He says the employer is currently paying $12,865 a year in health-care premiums for this family, while the family pays $5,277 in premiums. Virtually every economist will tell you that payroll taxes or health-insurance premiums paid by an employer largely comes out of the pay earned by the employee.

For instance, both employers and employees pay 6.2 percent to Social Security (on the first $132,900 of wages) and 1.45 percent to Medicare. The employer obviously counts that 7.65 percent ($3,825 for a $50,000 wage) as part of the cost of employing that person, as well as the nearly $13,000 in health insurance premiums. To the employer, the cost of that employee is not $50,000, but almost $67,000. (There are tax deductions for employer-provided health insurance, but we will ignore them as part of this illustration.)

AD

AD

But note that almost $13,000 in insurance premiums is 26 percent of $50,000. Sanders’s 7.5 percent tax would be $3,750, so that suggests more than $9,000 in savings for the employer. Under Medicare-for-all, the total cost of the employee to the employer would be a little over $57,000, a reduction of more than $9,000.

As for the 4 percent income premium paid by the employee, that amounts to $844 a year, once the standard deduction is taken into account, Sanders says. That’s far less than the nearly $5,300 in premiums currently paid by this family.

Biden, by contrast, only focuses on the cost of tax increase (apparently because polling has found that it’s a way to undercut support for Medicare-for-all). In the debate, Biden argued that a three-person family earning $60,000 a year will face more than $5,000 in taxes — the 4 percent premium tax ($1,240 after the standard deduction) and the 7.5 percent tax paid by employers ($4,500), on the widely accepted economic theory that payroll taxes paid by employers are passed onto employees.

AD

AD

Notice that he did not take into account any of the savings that Sanders claims his plan will generate both for the employee and employer. So he’s really only telling half the story, misleadingly ignoring a possible reduction in health-care costs for many Americans.

Sanders also chose an example in which the numbers work in his favor. The savings for the employer fade as an employee’s wages increase.

Sanders also focuses on the cost of a family plan, which has much higher premiums. The Milliman Medical Index, a respected accounting of health-care costs, says the employer contribution in 2019 will be $3,773 per person. (Total health-care costs for a family of four on an employer-provided plan are $28,386, Milliman says.) So a single person making $50,000 in theory would barely represent any savings for that employer — a 7.5 percent payroll tax on $50,000 is $3,750 — and the tax would quickly be higher than current expenses as wages increase.

AD

AD

Similarly, wealthier Americans would end up paying much more in taxes than they currently pay for health-care premiums. (We take no position on whether that’s good or bad, and certainly Sanders and Warren have been forthright in saying the wealthy would largely finance the plan.)

The uncertain complexity was examined in a 2018 University of Massachusetts at Amherst study that predicted the impact of enacting Medicare-for-all in a variety of employer and employee scenarios. The report does not examine all of the same financing options as Sanders, but it calculated that a three-person family with $60,000 income would gain almost $1,600 (2.6 percent) in additional income under Medicare-for-all, while a family with income of $221,000 (top 20 percent of wages earners), would lose $8,520 (3.9 percent) and a family with $401,000 (top 5 percent) would lose $22,340 (5.6 percent). (To create these scenarios, the report relies on data for 2016 mean incomes for various income ranges.)

Meanwhile, the report said most businesses would see a reduction in costs with even an 8.2 percent payroll tax but that firms of more than 500 employees would experience a 5.7 percent increase in health-care costs.

AD

AD

“Vice President Biden’s priority as president will be to make sure every single American has access to affordable, quality health insurance in the quickest, most cost-effective way possible,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. “That’s why his plan is to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option, allowing people to choose between this new option and their private plan, and taking other steps to lower health-care costs. Biden has also made clear that any health-care plan that raises taxes on the middle class is a nonstarter.”

The Bottom Line

Biden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders’s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It’s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation, and we will keep an eye on how Biden frames this in the future to see if he merits Pinocchios.

AD

Biden may have bungled his lines at the town hall, but he still has not developed an effective or sophisticated counterargument to Sanders’s prediction of lower overall costs. You can understand why Warren has generally refused to even acknowledge that there are higher taxes embedded in Medicare-for-all. She stays focused instead on an overall reduction in costs, clearly not wanting to engage in a debate on Biden’s playing field.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines on Saturday. (Nati Harnik/AP)

DECORAH, Iowa — The crowd that came to see Bernie Sanders was too big for Luther College's gym. It spilled over into a yard, where the senator delivered a short version of his stump speech — “the fate of the planet is at stake, democracy is at stake” — before he walked into a room full of “Bernie Beats Trump” signs.

But not everyone who showed up was sold on that message.

“I'm not necessarily a Bernie fan,” said Justin Knautz, 20, who said he was leaning toward South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeg. “Even if he could beat Trump, which I'm not sure about, our country's so divided already.”

“I'm super confident that he'd win,” Avery Pazour, 20, said of Sanders. “Young people are tired of the system the way that it is.”

“I'm exactly the opposite,” said Marin Gabor, 21. “I like Pete Buttigieg's public-health option. I guess that's a weird thing for a young person to say?""

Five months after Sanders began arguing that he was the most electable Democratic candidate, a pitch he made with a tour of Rust Belt states, he has made little progress with voters terrified of a second Trump term. National and state polling has found Sanders persistently behind former vice president Joe Biden when voters are asked who has the best chance of defeating the president. In the past month, polling has found Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) roughly tied with Sanders on “electability.”

The “Bernie beats Trump” tour was the latest attempt to push back. That meant showing what a general election would look like, with the candidate leading raw, emotional town hall meetings where voters explained how the economic system failed them. It meant emphasizing that polling had shown him ahead of Trump in 2016 — an argument he briefly made to “superdelegates.” It meant reminding people that he had won the primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan, where some Democrats slept on the 2016 general election.

In Iowa, Sanders occasionally referred to the national and state polls that have shown him ahead of Trump, but in an interview, he waved off the polling that had shown Democratic voters still nervous about how a democratic socialist could take the presidency.

“I'm not much into all these speculations and all these polls,” Sanders said. “One day a poll has me doing great, the next day a poll has me doing terrible. It has a lot to do with who you're polling and what questions you're asking. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to win, because we have an extraordinary grass-roots movement.”

Apart from some turnover in its early state staff, the Sanders campaign has shown some broad support. It celebrated its 1 millionth individual donor last week; shortly after that, it drew an estimated 4,000 voters to a rally in Norman, Okla. (A 2016 rally in Tulsa, three times the size of Norman, had attracted a crowd of 11,000.)

But it has struggled to convince early-state voters that Sanders could win a general election, and the senator's support in early states has slipped since the start of his campaign. In interviews around the state, some at the senator from Vermont's rallies, voters sometimes praised Sanders or explained why they used to support him before laying out the reasons that they were supporting someone else.

“I love him. We caucused for him in 2016,” said Scott German, 50, who spent Monday evening at a rally for Buttigieg in Dubuque. “If he could win and put forward everything he's talking about, it'd be utopia. But I don't think America's ready for it. We need somebody more realistic.”

Sanders's campaign is combating the skepticism with a busy schedule and with sharp contrasts, some of them brighter than others. When Sanders announced his 1 millionth donor, campaign manager Faiz Shakir described him as “the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grass-roots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump” — a knock at Warren, who has said her no-fundraisers pledge applies to only the primary and who is headlining some fundraisers for the DNC.

Speech by speech, Sanders has structured an electability pitch around his brand — that of an Old Testament prophet who has been saying the same things about health care and economic fairness for 30 years. At four rallies on Monday, he emphasized that taxes would go up to pay for Medicare-for-all, encouraging the crowd to think about how the media would frame that.

“Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes! How terrible is this guy?” Sanders said sarcastically in Decorah, waving his arms and imitating a negative ad. The upshot: He was ready to handle the criticism, some candidates were not, and therefore, he could win.

That theory is getting a real-time test in Iowa, one that has not gone well for Sanders. His campaign believes that the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a front group for insurance companies, has done damage to his support among Democrats by running digital and TV ads attacking Medicare-for-all. (Sanders has not yet purchased TV time in early states.) The senator's favorable numbers have decreased since the spring, robbing supporters of something that was true for years: that he was the most popular politician in America.

“There's a lot of lies going on about this,” Sanders said in Dubuque. “There's the health-care industry that's already advertising in here in Iowa. Every time you see that ad, know who paid for that ad! It was paid for by the drug companies and the insurance companies who made a hundred billion in profits last year. They love the current system! They're scared to death that we have the momentum to move to Medicare-for-all.”

The insurance industry ads make good foils, but Sanders is just as happy to criticize Biden. After learning that a pollster at Anzalone Liszt Grove Research had been testing messages against Medicare-for-all — John Anzalone is an adviser to Biden — Sanders emphasized that he was collecting story after story of medical debt, denied coverage and personal pain. Even after his events ended, he was being buttonholed by people with insurance horror stories. At every event, Sanders sees a story that is not being told in the corporate media. As the nominee, with that media bound to cover him, he could cut through the fog, he believes.

“If Joe Biden or anybody else wants to use the Republican Party and the health-care industry talking points, I guess they can. But we're going to win this fight because we're going to refute that disingenuous attack,” Sanders said. “You know, I think when I raised the issue during the last debate, that we spend twice as much, Biden's response was, 'This is America.' Well, I don't know that Americans have to be chumps and to give the health-care industry $100 billion a year.”

Polling has found Democrats to be nervous about that argument, even if they agree with Sanders on the merits. In the Des Moines Register's weekend poll, a quarter of Democrats said they supported the concept of Medicare-for-all but were worried it was a general election loser — a threat to the entire Sanders premise.

At a Democratic meeting in Story County on Sunday, Linda Trudeau, 72, said that had never been convinced that Sanders could win. Warren had piqued her interest, she said, because she seemed liberal, but less stubborn.

“She's got to give up Medicare-for-all or she won't get elected,” said Trudeau. “She's not quite nailed down on that, unlike Bernie. That's a good thing.”

Pete Buttigieg speaks at a campaign event in Clinton, Iowa, on Tuesday. (Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters)

DUBUQUE, Iowa — First, there are the introductions from local Democrats. Then there’s the theme song — “High Hopes” by Panic! at the Disco, with a brass hook that tests the integrity of speakers and eardrums. Then the bus — a bus previously hired by everyone from Barack Obama to the producers of “Madam Secretary” — rolls into view. Only then does Pete Buttigieg race onto stage.

“Thanks for making me feel right at home!” Buttigieg told the crowd, 800 voters at an amphitheater on the banks of the Mississippi River. “You know, Dubuque has a great reputation among mayors — an example of a city leading the way, when Washington can’t get its act together.”

Buttigieg, one of the few Democrats whose favorability has increased over the primary campaign, is busy reintroducing himself as the candidate who can talk about anything — no gaffes, no dodges. On the bus, Buttigieg took questions on everything from college football (“problematic”) to how many white button-down shirts he owned (“a baker’s dozen”) to the violent abolitionist John Brown (“kind of a brutal guy”). When his Dubuque speech was over, Buttigieg worked the rope line for a half-hour, then walked over to the few reporters not on the bus to take more questions.

It wasn't an entirely new strategy. Buttigieg's early jump in the polls came after he did interview after interview, saying yes to TV shows and small outlets that were used to getting turned down. Most voters would not hear everything he said, but they could see that he was taking any questions.

The bus tour, and the entire media strategy, was also designed to show a contrast. The voters seen as most gettable for Buttigieg are moderates who have been disappointed by Joe Biden; the former vice president holds frequent media availabilities but has made a series of confusing statements, all of them amplified by social media.

Buttigieg's accessibility also contrasts with the candidates who've commanded the most attention so far, and for different reasons. Elizabeth Warren's short press gaggles are designed to make minimal news, and in the past week, she swerved back to a stock answer when asked whether her Medicare plans would raise “middle-class taxes” — something Buttigieg pounced on.

“Sen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question,” Buttigieg had told CNN before the start of the tour. “And we've seen that repeatedly.”

Buttigieg's approach also clashed with Kamala Harris, whose uneasy answers to some policy questions sapped her momentum, and with Bernie Sanders, who often urges reporters to steer back to his preferred topic instead of badgering him about the horse race or the latest Trump news. With that group of competitors, and with a support base that gushes about his ability to communicate, Buttigieg's advantage was clear: He could go on the record about anything. The comparison with other candidates would become obvious.

“I will explain how we will pay for every promise that I make,” Buttigieg said in Dubuque. “It's why I'm a little careful about the promises I do make.”

On the stump, Buttigieg did not mention rival candidates by name. “I think I've named my disagreements with their plans at various times,” he explained afterward. Other candidates, such as Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, have also described their plans as realistic, or truth-telling — candidates who promise more than could probably pass, or plans that aren't fully paid for, get described as less straightforward. Asked whether he would rule out any middle-class tax increases, Buttigieg emphasized that nothing he was for had required them.

“Everything that we've rolled out to date can be achieved without a middle-class tax increase, and we're going to make sure that it's clear how the revenue side will work,” he said. “It does mean tax increases for the top 2 percent. It will mean a wealth tax or something like it. It can certainly mean closing corporate tax loopholes.”

How far would the transparency go? Several campaigns lagging behind Buttigieg have criticized him for holding so many fundraisers. Unlike Biden, who has faced the same criticism, Buttigieg has not let the media in to cover those fundraisers.

“We're open to thinking about it,” he said. “I think right now we're focused on what we can achieve on the bus tour, because it's just a different conversation than any other format that we have. But the team will always evaluate strategy and other ideas.”

POLL WATCH

New Hampshire Democratic primary (Monmouth, 401 likely Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 27% ( 19)

Joe Biden — 25% (-9)

Bernie Sanders — 12% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg — 10% ( 1)

Kamala Harris — 3% (-3)

Cory Booker — 2% (-)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 2)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% (-)

Tom Steyer — 2% ( 2)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Beto O’Rourke — 1% (-1)

Marianne Williamson — 1% ( 1)

Polling in the first primary state has found (with different methodology) everything from a sizable lead for Bernie Sanders to resilient support for Joe Biden. This is the first major poll to find Elizabeth Warren positioned in the lead, albeit within the margin of error; more important is her favorable rating, which has risen since May from a net 39 points to a net 55 points, higher than any other candidate. Warren's strength extends even to voters who disagree with her on health care; she wins 40 percent of Democrats who, like she, support single-payer, but wins 25 percent among Democrats who support a ""public option"" instead. Warren's positioning might be helping her; she has endorsed a bevy of liberal health-care bills and is not as strongly associated as Sanders with Medicare-for-all.

Nevada Democratic caucus (Suffolk, 500 likely voters)

Joe Biden — 23%

Elizabeth Warren — 19%

Bernie Sanders — 14%

Kamala Harris — 4%

Pete Buttigieg — 3%

Cory Booker — 3%

Tom Steyer — 3%

Andrew Yang — 3%

Tulsi Gabbard — 1%

Michael Bennet — 1%

Beto O’Rourke — 1%

Julián Castro — 1%

The least-visited early state — even Democrats sometimes forget that it caucuses before South Carolina votes — has no obvious favorite. A tiny plurality of voters said that Elizabeth Warren did worse than they expected in the September debate; a tiny plurality said that Joe Biden did worse than they expected.

DEBATE SEASON

The fifth DNC debates, which will be held sometime in November, will introduce new, strict thresholds for entry in the latest effort to limit the party's biggest nights to candidates with widespread support. The short version: Candidates will need 165,000 individual donations (up from 130,000) to get space onstage, and polling at 2 percent won't cut it anymore.

In the new rules, candidates can reach the polling threshold in two ways: by hitting 3 percent in four polls (or more) recognized by the DNC or by hitting 5 percent in two (or more) polls taken in the first four primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The count started Sept. 13; it'll stop seven days before the date of the fifth debate, which has not yet been announced.

The DNC is transparent about which polls it counts. They are: the Associated Press; ABC News-Washington Post; CBS News-YouGov; CNN; Des Moines Register; Fox News; Monmouth University; NPR; NBC News-Wall Street Journal; NBC News-Marist; New York Times; Quinnipiac University; University of New Hampshire; USA Today-Suffolk University; and Winthrop University, which polls in South Carolina.

At the moment, using these standards, just five candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Just four other candidates have claimed to reach that new donor threshold: Tom Steyer, Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang.

2020

Joe Biden. He gave a prepared statement in Wilmington, Del., addressing the Ukraine saga more fully by saying no allegation about his son Hunter had merit and that the president was setting himself on a course to impeachment: “a tragedy of his own making.”

Tulsi Gabbard. She qualified for the fourth Democratic debate, after notching her fourth poll at 2 percent support — the Monmouth poll from New Hampshire. That significantly ups the chances of CNN, the debate's TV host, splitting the debate into two nights, each with six candidates.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a new version of a “wealth tax,” a concept that he had introduced five years ago but that Elizabeth Warren had formulated for this presidential campaign. Unlike Warren's 2 percent tax (which has been strong when polled), Sanders's would tackle wealth in tiers: a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million, a 4 percent tax on net worth between $500 million and $1 billion, a 5 percent tax on net worth between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, a 6 percent tax on net worth between $2.5 billion $5 billion, a 7 percent tax on net worth between $5 billion and $10 billion, and an 8 percent tax on net worth above $10 billion.

Elizabeth Warren. She'll return to New Hampshire on Wednesday and Friday, her first visits to the state since shifts in polling found her in contention to win the primary. In a Q&A with the Council on Foreign Relations, she laid out her policies on issues not much discussed at campaign events, such as the fate of Venezuela's embattled president.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Pick your metaphor — the dam is breaking, or maybe the floodgates, or maybe the Rubicon is being crossed — but House Democrats have begun moving faster toward some form of impeachment, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The president's apparent effort to obtain damaging information on Joe Biden's son in a call with Ukraine's president has pushed dozens of “front-line” Democrats into the fray; in the past 48 hours, more Democrats who represent districts won by President Trump have endorsed impeachment than had endorsed it in the past nine months.

Republicans claim to be overjoyed. “They’re obsessed with impeaching President Trump and they don’t care if they have to throw away the House Majority to do it,” wrote Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the House GOP's super PAC, after a group of Trump-seat Democrats came out for impeachment proceedings.

Thirty-one House Democrats represent districts won by the president in 2016, but they're not all created equal.

Blue-trending districts. Ten House Democrats won 2018 races in areas where Donald Trump ran behind Mitt Romney, from the Detroit suburbs won by Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan to the Chicago exurbs won by Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. And some of these districts voted for the statewide Democratic tickets last year, suggesting that the Trump brand has continued to hurt local Republicans.

Trump-trending districts. Twenty-one Democrats represent districts that either edged a toward the president in 2016, some by a little (Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia's district went from a 2.3-point Mitt Romney win to 3.4-point Trump win), some by a lot (Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota's massive district backed Mitt Romney by 9.8 points, then Trump by 30.8 points). Twelve of them come from places that flipped from backing Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Trump four years later.

Democrats with/without real opponents. The filing deadline for 2020 races is months away; only Illinois and Texas require House candidates to file by the end of this year. But not every Democrat who flipped a House seat last year is facing a real challenge yet. Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania is facing a first-time challenger who has raised less than $20,000; Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan hasn't drawn a Republican opponent. On the other side of the equation are Democrats such as Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, whose chief opponent, Wesley Hunt, raised more than $500,000 in just a few months as a candidate; after Fletcher joined the impeachment call, Hunt accused her of endorsing a ""blatantly partisan impeachment investigation.”

But if the president is essentially withholding military aid, at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, that is, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.

We’re going to hear from the director of national intelligence on Thursday why he is the first director to withhold ever a whistleblower complaint. And we are going to make sure that we get that complaint, that whistleblower is protected.

And we're going to make sure that we find out whether the president has engaged in this kind of improper conduct. But it may be that we do have to move forward with that extraordinary remedy, if indeed the president is, at the same time withholding vital military assistance, he is trying to leverage that to obtain impermissible help in his political campaign.

Senate lawmakers are eager to take Facebook to task for its high-profile acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp at a big antitrust hearing today. But one of their key witnesses will warn them that heavyhanded regulation from Washington could have unintended consequences for tech startups -- and ultimately prevent them from becoming competitors to tech giants.

“It’s critical that policymakers understand that not all [mergers and acquisitions are] the same,” Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures, will tell lawmakers on a Senate Judiciary subcommittee today, according to her prepared testimony.

One of lawmakers' top concerns at this afternoon's hearing on ""acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors"" will be whether Facebook tried to prevent the rise of new competitors by buying them up. But Nakache will stress that, if Washington goes too far in scrutinizing deals, it could end up causing problems for smaller companies seeking funding so they can challenge existing leaders in the industry.

She plans to warn lawmakers against “the unintended consequence of dampening the creation of and investment in companies that seek to directly challenge incumbents.""

Nakache will be one of the first venture capitalists to publicly testify about competition on Capitol Hill since antitrust scrutiny increased this summer. Her comments reflect their delicate position. Startups stand to benefit if the tech giants they hope to compete with are distracted by Washington's antitrust inquiries or regulators impose more limitations on their business. But at the same time, small tech companies are still deeply intertwined with -- and reliant on -- existing larger platforms.

That tension is particularly acute when it comes to acquisitions, which are a very common way for venture capitalists and founders to get a return on their investment in a startup. The four companies under scrutiny in Washington -- Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon -- are some of the biggest acquirers of tech startups. Problems for them could mean problems for deals.

So far, the tech giants have continued to acquire smaller companies, as we wrote about in The Technology 202 this summer when Google bought Looker. Just yesterday, Facebook acquired the brain computing startup CTRL-labs.

“I am concerned,” said Scott Kupor, managing partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and author of the new book “Secrets of Sand Hill Road"" told me at the time of the Looker acquisition. “It's not a tomorrow problem, but if this goes on for five, ten years, it could have a meaningful impact.”

Yet lawmakers are growing fed up with the Wild West environment that has allowed Silicon Valley tech titans to amass so much power, and some think it's time for Washington to play a greater role on these issues. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told me in an email that today's hearing is important because recent mergers have raised serious competition issues.

“Big technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world,” said Klobuchar, who is also running for president. “These companies' practices can limit options for consumers, distort prices, and stifle innovation. With virtually no meaningful pushback from our government, these companies have reshaped the meaning of American privacy, the purchasing of goods and services, and the working of our elections and our democracy.”

She has previously called for antitrust laws to be modernized and for more resources for federal regulators to enforce existing laws.

Other witnesses at the hearing will include Bruce Hoffman, director of the Bureau of competition at the Federal Trade Commission, as well as American Antitrust Institute president Diana Moss and John Yun, director of economic education At The Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University.

BITS: Google scored a key victory as a European court ruled that the company does not have to apply the ""Right to be Forgotten"" rule globally, the BBC's Leo Kelion reports this morning. When it receives a request to remove information under the law, Google will only have to remove links from its search results in the European Union, not elsewhere.

""Currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,"" the European Court of Justice ruling said.

The decision comes after a French regulator ordered Google to globally remove search result listing pages about a person under the European law, which allows people to ask tech companies to remove damaging or false information about them online. Google created a geoblocking feature that censored the links in Europe, but ensured they were still available to people in other parts of the world. Google then challenged a 100,000 fine the French regulator levied against the company.

The case has broad implications as technology companies operate globally across borders, and regulators around the world increasingly consider regulations to rein in American tech giants. Google argued removing the links globally could set a precedent that authoritarian governments outsie of Europe could abuse when trying to hide human rights abuses.

NIBBLES: Political campaigns and advocacy groups are taking a page from marketers by partnering with social media influencers in hopes of getting an edge with digital natives, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Georgia Wells report. Presidential campaigns of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang are all hoping that the Internet-grown celebrities will be able to persuade potential voters more than impersonal television ads or mailers, Emily and Georgia report.

Candidates' approaches to influencers varies. Kamala Harris's campaign has offered event invitations and merchandise in exchange for promoting her campaign; Andrew Yang's campaign has employed a public relations firm to create memes for influencers to share.

The Republican National Committee, which is fielding only one candidate, has taken a much more aggressive approach, offering social media influencers social-media training at its headquarters, Georgia and Emily report. Trump's campaign has also advertised on multiple YouTube channels, a significant platform for his base.

These efforts are expected to increase as 2020 approaches. Curtis Hougland, founder of tech start-up Main Street One — which is working on micro-targeted campaigns in several states — tells the Journal.

BYTES: Facebook took down a page spreading conservative content called “I Love America” and eight associated pages yesterday after a media report publicized that the page was run by Ukrainians, my colleague Craig Timberg reports. The continued circulation of political content targeted at American audiences by foreign actors raises doubts about Facebook's ability to curb foreign influence on its platform before the 2020 elections.

The page was founded in 2017, but only recently moved into spreading conservative content to an audience of more than 1 million followers, according to journalist Judd Legum, who first flagged the page to Facebook.

While Facebook originally told Legum that the page did not violate appear to violate its rules for coordinated inauthentic behavior, it determined the pages did violate the policy and removed them late yesterday. Facebook said it did not detect that the pages were tied to any nation-state actor, but its investigation is ongoing. The pages appeared to be ""financially motivated, Facebook's head of cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher said on Twitter, adding that ""it's also critical that we don’t assume every clickbait operation is [government operations.]""

The pages repurposed content connected with Russia's Internet Research Agency, which continues to surface on both Facebook and Instagram. Researchers including David Carroll have questioned why the company hasn't done more to prevent the content from continuing to circulate.

You’d think Facebook would have fingerprinted the RU IRA memes to automate their detection when recycled on new pages with huge audiences in the US but operated out of Ukraine.

-- Apple will manufacture its new Mac Pro in Texas after the Trump administration granted the company exemptions from tariffs on several key components manufactured in China, my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.

“We believe deeply in the power of American innovation,” Cook said in the statement. “That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the U. S, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with U.S. suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”

The exemptions mark a reversal on Trump's previous comments about Apple and tariffs. President Trump tweeted in July: “Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China.""

The Trump administration granted the company exemptions for 10 items last week, but many more core products, including the iPhone, will face steep tariffs by the end of the year unless the U.S. government strikes a new trade deal with China, Reed reports.

Sometimes.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/24/fox-news-apologizes-offensive-remarks-sometimes/,"Fox News host Harris Faulkner — subbing in for MacCallum — appeared to have trouble determining whether calling climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, “mentally ill” was offensive. So she punted to radio host Christopher Hahn, who said, ""You’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child. Shame on you.”

Crosstalk then took over as the two antagonists did precisely what Fox News wanted them to do. “Now, relax, skinny boy,” Hahn said at one point. “Have some couth when you’re on television. Maybe on your podcast you get away and say whatever you want because nobody’s listening. You’re on national television. Be a grown-up when you’re talking about children.”

AD

AD

Fox News later sided with Hahn, calling the remarks “disgraceful” and issuing a full apology to Thunberg and its viewers. The full text of the apology provides critical information as to why Fox News chose this path. Here it is: “The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful — we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.”

Bolding inserted to highlight a critical consideration for Fox News, which is: This guy is not on our payroll. He’s just some fellow with the Daily Wire who agreed to appear on Fox News for a talk on climate change.

What happens when critical Fox News personnel make comments that are just as outrageous, if not more so? Well, scroll back to the time that network host Tucker Carlson said that immigrants make the United States “dirtier.” Activists rallied advertisers to bail on their “Tucker Carlson Tonight” spots, and Fox News grabbed the mantle of the First Amendment: ""It is a shame that left-wing advocacy groups, under the guise of being supposed ‘media watchdogs,’ weaponize social media against companies in an effort to stifle free speech,” it said.

AD

AD

In July, Carlson launched a nakedly racist attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Outrage ensued, though Carlson assured viewers that the network has “got our back.” The Fox News suits were similarly supportive after Media Matters for America in March presented old racist and homophobic remarks that Carlson had made on a radio show. In one of them, he called Iraqis ""semi-literate primitive monkeys.”

On the same night that Knowles called Thunberg “mentally ill,” prime-time host Laura Ingraham ran some video of Thunberg’s remarks on climate accountability and then quipped, “I can’t wait for Stephen King's sequel, ‘Children of the Climate.'"" That, of course, was a riff on the tale of a murder cult run by children. We asked Fox News if it might just have a statement regarding Ingraham’s quip. No response yet.

In October 2018, a Fox Business Network executive denounced some anti-Semitic remarks that a guest had made on Lou Dobbs’s show. Those remarks had aired right after the mass killing at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight,” said the executive. And a while back a Fox Business guest claimed that torture had “worked” on John McCain; no longer would that guest, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, appear on the network.

AD

AD

Good. Also good are other instances in which the network has taken strong and public action against paid contributors. In March, it condemned host Jeanine Pirro for Islamophobic remarks regarding Omar: ""Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?” asked Pirro.

If Fox News were a government agency, we’d submit a FOIA request for the formula that determines when to apologize and when to dig in. But whatever the formula says, it sure gets a lot of exercise.

The skirmish illustrated how ill-equipped Democrats, busy battling one another in the fight for the nomination, are to compete with Trump’s online megaphone, which includes not just his own Twitter feed and that of the Republican National Committee’s leadership, but also a regiment of conservative talking heads and highly active Internet trolls who have closed ranks around the president.

The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump.

But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.

“This is the first big test of the 2020 race: Is the press, are Democrats, are Democratic activists, going to let that happen again?” said Jennifer Palmieri, who was the Clinton campaign’s director of communications.

AD

AD

She and other former Clinton aides have been watching with an apprehensive sense of deja vu as they see Trump solicit a foreign government’s help in attacking a political adversary.

“You need to be aggressive so people know what’s true and what’s not,” she said. “You can’t pick your fights. . . . It’s a terrible situation for a campaign to be in. But that’s life when you’re dealing with Donald Trump.”

Biden has been buffeted in recent weeks by a flood of claims on social media seeking to weaponize his debate misstatements and other verbal miscues. The attacks have come not just from the right, but from the left as well.

The assertion that Biden behaved corruptly when it came to Ukraine marked a significant escalation by Trump and his allies to elevate what are unsubstantiated claims into a dangerous threat to the 76-year-old’s candidacy.

Zac Petkanas, the director of rapid response for Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said Democrats may have miscalculated four years ago in ignoring conspiracy theories that sprouted on the fringes of the Internet. They quickly went mainstream, Clinton’s campaign realized.

“The false attacks really were effective at sowing doubt, not only within a right-wing sphere, which is what we originally thought, but within our own supporters,” Petkanas said.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.

AD

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

AD

Trump has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence as vice president, and the president appeared to confirm on Sunday that he raised the matter in a July phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Washington Post Fact Checker analyzed several of the claims from Trump and his allies in May and gave them three Pinocchios.

Trump took his attacks even further on Monday — without proof — after Biden told Trump to release the transcript of his calls with Ukraine.

AD

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right?” Trump said, as he was meeting with the Polish president at the United Nations. He added: “If that ever happened — if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.”

AD

While Clinton initially ignored escalating conspiracy theories, Biden’s campaign has mobilized its research team, attempting to find ways to combat false charges and return the focus to Trump. They point to polls repeatedly showing Biden defeating Trump and say he has rattled the incumbent president.

“In an outrageous and unprecedented act of corruption — and at the expense of our national security priorities — Donald Trump pressured a foreign country to smear the Democratic candidate he’s most afraid of facing next November,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman. “This kind of ‘self over country’ gutter politics is grossly beneath what we stand for as a country and will be aggressively fought against by the campaign. For the sake of our democracy, it is also incumbent on the press to finally internalize the lessons of 2016 and dispense with the uncritical repetition of wholesale lies simply because Donald Trump says them.”

Biden, at a fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday, said the president’s behavior was troubling. “The more he thinks he’s likely to lose, the more erratic he becomes and the more things he does that are worrisome,” Biden said.

AD

Over the weekend, the Biden campaign and Trump released dueling videos on Twitter that underscored the social media imbalance Democrats are fighting.

Trump’s video was viewed about 2.7 million times — nearly five times more than Biden’s video. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who was sentenced to prison last year for lying to the FBI, sent a tweet Friday night spreading another unfounded allegation against Biden — and it got more retweets than the video posted at the top of Biden’s official Twitter account.

AD

On Facebook, Trump’s supporters also mobilized, amplifying unfounded rumors about the vice president and his son. Conservative social media influencers Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as Diamond and Silk, weighed in on Friday evening, with their post gaining thousands of shares hours before Biden’s campaign had put out anything more than a plain statement on the platform addressing Trump’s phone call.

AD

Top results on Facebook included material from pro-Trump news pages, some of which are operated by users outside the United States. Many of these pages enjoy more than a million followers, who are treated to a battery of videos and links to articles from websites that run hyper-partisan articles, often without bylines.

The online battles illustrate how the campaign is increasingly unfolding in an unregulated digital ecosystem, one in which Trump has eschewed traditional political norms.

AD

Social media companies maintain that they are not arbiters of truth and intervene only when there is evidence of coordinated inauthentic activity — a position that has frustrated Democrats. Although Democrats generally have put faith in institutions — the Justice Department, the media and Congress — to check Trump’s stretching presidential power, they see few avenues of recourse against the Trump fusillade, even as House Democrats debate whether to begin impeachment proceedings.

AD

“Regardless of who our nominee is, I think we’re going to face similar unconventional actions by the president, and so this is something that should concern the DNC,” Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said Saturday as he trailed Biden into the grounds of the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines. “I don’t have a concrete idea off the top of my head.”

The party “ought to take every possible responsible action,” Coons said, adding that one option might be filing with the Federal Election Commission. But that would probably be futile, he admitted, because the body lacks a quorum.

Brian Fallon, the chief spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, said arguing with Trump on merits was hardly ever successful and said he believes the best option Democrats have is putting Trump on the daily defensive with impeachment proceedings.

“It’s just a nasty mess. You heard that about emails,” Fallon said. “In the end, people thought it was a mountain being made of a molehill. But then they’d invariably blame Hillary for setting up the server in the first place. They’d blame her a little bit even though they thought Trump was being unfair.”

Biden in June issued a promise not to use false or purloined information and called on other candidates to do the same. But the party has not acted on a resolution that would bind all its candidates to similar norms, even though the pledge was endorsed earlier this year by state party chairs.

Democratic lawmakers have been quick to condemn the president, but they strained to formulate a way for the party to respond collectively to Trump’s claims. From staunch Biden allies to rivals for the Democratic nomination, there wasn’t a clear sense of how to maneuver tactically to quiet Trump’s megaphone or come up with a counternarrative.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said the president’s alleged phone call was “just another on the list of issues” that warrant his impeachment.

When asked in an interview what other Democratic candidates could do to present a united front, she said, “I’m not going to tell other candidates what to do.”"

That’s what’s so outrageous about Trump’s alleged push to get dirt on his potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, in a July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country.

Trump isn’t even bothering to deny the basics. He confirmed Tuesday that he had held up delivery of a promised $391 million in military aid for the Ukrainians in mid-July, before his call to Zelensky. Trump claimed he wanted to pressure “Europe and other nations to contribute to Ukraine.” Trump had suggested Sunday that in the July call he had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son’s work for a Ukrainian gas company.

Forget the political jousting between Trump and Biden, and consider the Ukrainian soldier in the field fighting to save his country. He has a nightmare communications problem because he can’t talk reliably with his commanders. Russia has been hacking or jamming Ukrainian military communications since it seized Crimea and began supporting the separatists in 2014.

The United States wanted to help fix this battlefield communications disaster. One item in the $391 million package Congress appropriated is a secure system made by L3 Technologies, a unit of Harris Corp., that could allow the Ukrainians to maintain contact despite Russian interference. The L3 equipment was ready for delivery in July when the company was told no, there was a hold, the equipment couldn’t be shipped, according to a congressional source.

AD

AD

L3 and other companies supplying Ukraine contacted leading Republican members of Congress, such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) to find out why there was a delay. The members of Congress made inquiries and learned that the Office of Management and Budget had stopped the shipments, on orders of the White House, to conduct “due diligence” about corruption and the newly elected Zelensky, according to one knowledgeable source.

But Graham warned the White House: “You can’t send a signal that we’re going to back out of the deal,” the source said, adding, “It’s one thing to do ‘due diligence’ and another that we’re changing our posture.” These national security arguments eventually prevailed, and the Ukraine assistance was finally released on Sept. 11.

Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are. One legislator who worried about the holdup of L3’s communications package was Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), a former Air Force officer who represents a state where L3 has some of its plants.

AD

AD

Houlahan told me Monday: “I’m alarmed about reports that the provision of military equipment — which Ukraine needs, which Congress supported — was stopped, inexplicably, and then started up again, inexplicably. . . . Ukraine, an ally of ours, is under stress fighting Russian proxies. The idea that this happened with very little reasonable explanation is worrisome.” An L3 spokesperson declined to comment.

People who regard this latest Trump affair as just more political noise should examine an op-ed published online Monday by seven freshman Democrats who served in Iraq, Afghanistan or other military deployments. These aren’t reflexive Trump bashers. They’re mostly from swing districts where impeachment isn’t very popular, but the Ukraine case pushed them to recommend that radical step.

Here’s what Houlahan and the six other national-security veterans wrote in The Post: Trump “allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain.”

The former military and intelligence officers saw Trump’s actions as a potential violation of his oath of office, requiring urgent investigation, and they’re right. This isn’t just another partisan fight. It goes to the essential obligations of a commander in chief.

They explained that the president had “concerns” and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.

Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an “interagency process” but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11.

Trump’s order to withhold aid to Ukraine a week before his July 25 call with Volodymyr Zelensky is likely to raise questions about the motivation for his decision and fuel suspicions on Capitol Hill that Trump sought to leverage congressionally approved aid to damage a political rival. The revelation comes as lawmakers clash with the White House over a related whistleblower complaint made by an intelligence official alarmed by Trump’s actions — and as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is said to be exploring whether it’s time to allow impeachment proceedings.

Republican senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee said Sept. 12 that the aid to Ukraine had been held up while the Trump administration explored whether Zelensky, the country’s new president, was pro-Russian or pro-Western. They said the White House decided to release the aid after Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) threatened to freeze $5 billion in Pentagon funding for next year unless the money for 2019 was distributed.

One senior administration official said Monday that Trump’s decision to hold back the funds was based on his concerns about there being “a lot of corruption in Ukraine” and that the determination to release the money was motivated by the fiscal year’s looming close on Sept. 30.

AD

AD

There was concern within the administration that if they did not spend the money, they would run afoul of the law, this official said, noting that, eventually, Trump gave the OMB’s acting director, Russell Vought, permission to release the money. The official emphatically denied that there was any link between blocking the aid and pressing Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, stating: “It had nothing to do with a quid pro quo.”

But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were calling for an investigation of what they viewed as potential “extortion,” as Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking Democrat, put it Monday. Trump, he said, is trying to “reshape American foreign policy” to advance his personal and political goals.

“I don’t think it really matters . . . whether the president explicitly told the Ukrainians that they wouldn’t get their security aid if they didn’t interfere in the 2020 elections,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “There is an implicit threat in every demand that a United States president makes of a foreign power. . . . That foreign country knows that if they don’t do it, there are likely to be consequences.”

AD

AD

Trump on Monday repeated his denial of doing anything improper and insisted that his July 25 conversation with Zelensky was “a perfect phone call.” He also hinted that he may release a transcript of it.

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley rejected claims that Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo. “But because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president,” Gidley said.

Zelensky’s “entire” administration was concerned “that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens,” Murphy said, citing his interactions with numerous Ukrainian officials during an early September trip there. Murphy said he heard “directly” from Zelensky about “his concern about why the aid was being cut off to Ukraine,” though the Ukraine’s new president did not specifically broach the subject of a quid pro quo.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases — at one point, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Trump’s allies have frequently said he has been better about distributing military aid, and specifically lethal aid, to Ukraine than his predecessor. Yet according to Democratic and Republican aides, no administration has withheld funds as long and as mysteriously as the Trump administration did this year since the United States began helping Ukraine fend off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern provinces.

Congressional officials were notified twice this year, on Feb. 28 and again on May 23, that the administration intended to release large tranches of military aid to Ukraine. Congress approved two large pots of military aid for Ukraine during fiscal 2019: $250 million, to be managed by the Pentagon, for equipment such as sniper rifles, counter-artillery radar systems, ammunition and grenade launchers; and $141 million, to be funneled through the State Department, for maritime security, NATO interoperability and various initiatives to help Ukraine’s military fend off Russian aggression.

AD

AD

Despite those notifications, the money was not transmitted until this month.

According to administration officials, discussions about Ukrainian aid began in June. Withholding aid from foreign governments is something the president has frequently requested, such as with Central American countries when he said they were not doing their part to help the United States with immigrants amassing at the southern border.

Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted to release the money to Ukraine because he thought it would help the country while curtailing Russian aggression. But Trump has said he was primarily concerned with corruption.

“It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Trump told reporters. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

AD

AD

Besides Bolton, several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.

The decision was communicated to State and Defense officials on July 18, officials familiar with the meeting said.

By mid-August, lawmakers were acutely aware that the OMB had assumed all decision-making authority from the Defense and State departments and was delaying the distribution of the aid through a series of short-term notices. Several congressional officials questioned whether the OMB had the legal authority to direct federal agencies not to spend money that Congress had already authorized, aides said.

AD

Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the State Department declined to comment.

Mid-August is also when a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint regarding Trump and Ukraine to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the complaint’s existence Sept. 9 — the same day three House committees launched an investigation to determine whether Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had improperly pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

AD

Capitol Hill has not been briefed on the details of the whistleblower complaint, on orders of the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who after consulting with the Justice Department and the White House declined to transmit the complaint to lawmakers. On Thursday, Maguire is set to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee and in a closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Correction: This story was updated to clarify that, during his visit to Ukraine earlier this month, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) learned of concerns from several officials in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration that U.S. aid was being withheld because of the Ukrainian government’s unwillingness to investigate the Bidens. Zelensky, however, did not specifically draw a connection to the Bidens when he met with Murphy."

On The Hill

THE POINT OF NO RETURN: Pressure is mounting on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open the formal impeachment inquiry she has so long resisted.

And then there were 146: On Monday night, seven House Democrats with national security and military backgrounds who won competitive House districts in 2018 came out to back launching an impeachment inquiry — bringing the total count of Democrats in favor of opening an inquiry to 146.

In an op-ed in The Post, freshman Democratic Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia write:

“If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

They are referring to allegations Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Joe Biden and his son. Trump did so while the United States was withholding promised aid from Ukraine.

House Dem just now: “the dam is breaking” on impeachment. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

More than a majority: Pelosi, who has said impeaching Trump is “just not worth it,” is now “sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach President Trump,” multiple Democratic officials told my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis.

“Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has asked colleagues whether they believe that Trump’s own admission that he pressured a Ukrainian leader to investigate a political foe is a tipping point,” Rachael and Mike report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night to gauge support in the caucus, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable.”

From a Pelosi ally: Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a close Pelosi ally, also has changed her tune, writing in a statement that an impeachment inquiry “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable.

“Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she tweeted.

On today's docket: Pelosi has summoned House leaders to a 4 p.m. meeting to discuss the matter.

“Mindful that Democrats may have only a brief window to decide their course, [Pelosi] summoned the leaders of six House committees involved in investigations of the president to meet on Tuesday, telling the lawmakers to come without aides. Afterward, she planned to convene a special meeting of the Democratic caucus to discuss impeachment,” the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, Nick Fandos, Michael Crowley and Ken Vogel report. A full meeting of the Democratic caucus will take place afterward.

Rachael and Mike report that House leadership has discussed “the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence” to handle a hypothetical impeachment inquiry.

In the meantime though, Pelosi still faces some political obstacles:

“Voters still overwhelming disapprove of Democrats impeaching the president — though those polls where conducted before last week’s reports about the whistleblower complaint. In the Senate, Republicans have made it clear that they are standing with Trump and are unlikely to convict him if a trial occurs,” per Rachael and Mike.

But Trump seems impervious to the growing political firestorm — indeed, he appeared to be stoking it yesterday with incendiary comments targeting Biden at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.

“What he’s learned is you can get away with just about anything if you’re willing to gamble and you have zero shame,” Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, told the New York Times's Peter Baker. “He had just outbluffed the old-school way of holding people to account, so what the heck, why not go for it in the phone call to the new, young and vulnerable Ukrainian president?”

“It’s difficult to imagine a purer example, even on the president’s own account of his conduct, of why the Constitution’s framers thought it essential to include the impeachment power,” Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told Baker.

At The White House

THE FACTS ARE COMING OUT: As the White House refuses to release the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky, reporters unearthed important details fueling suspicions Trump may have sought to leverage and withhold congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.

The latest: “President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials,” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig.

“Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had 'concerns' and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.”

Key: “Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an 'interagency process' but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,” per Karoun, Josh, Ellen and Carol.

'A perfect phone call': That's how Trump has described the July phoner with Ukraine's president. But Zelensky spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) during an early September visit to Ukraine and “'directly' expressed concerns at their meeting that 'the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence' of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens,” per our colleagues.

Trump took his attacks on Biden and the press to a whole new level:

“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump told reporters on Monday from a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.

The Campaign

DNC RAISES DEBATE THRESHOLDS: “The Democratic National Committee announced new qualification rules for the November debates,” our colleague Michael Scherer writes of the decision “that could kick more candidates off the stage, as party leaders continue to push to shrink the field in the presidential nomination fight.”

The new rules: "" … candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada,” Scherer reports.

Who is in trouble: Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Rep. John Delaney (Md.) have yet to qualify for the October debate. They've so far failed to rank in a single qualifying poll.

(Colo.), (Ohio), Montana Gov. and (Md.) have yet to qualify for the October debate. They've so far failed to rank in a single qualifying poll.

Shades of McCain: ""Pete Buttigieg was inside his campaign bus, with reporters an arm's length away all looking directly at him, their notebooks, pens and recorders in hand,"" the Des Moines Register's Barbara Rodriguez reports. Bus tours across Iowa are quite common, but in a modern day twist on the late Sen. John McCain's ""Straight Talk Express,"" Buttigieg's team welcomed reporters to join him for the entirety of his four-day trip, everything on-the-record.

Some of the questions he's answered so far: ""What does he think about growing calls for an impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump?"" Rodriguez writes. ""Did he have a comment on the Republican Party's talking points about the presidential race? How does he assess the current psyche of American voters? What does he miss about home? How many of his signature white shirts and jeans had he packed for his four-day bus tour across Iowa? And was he ironing"" (4 shirts, he ironed himself; one pair of jeans).

In the Media

THIS BOMBSHELL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER: A.G. Sulzberger, the Times publisher, spoke at Brown University about the state of journalism. He discussed for the first time a story that shows how much the Trump administration “has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press.” It is simply jaw-dropping.

You can read the full-text of his speech here.

What happened: “Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh,” Sulzberger said. “Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.”

Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.” But this time was different: “We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said.

The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said. Luckily, they figured out another way: “Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help,” Sulzberger said. “Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.”

TRUMP POPS INTO CLIMATE SUMMIT: The president unexpectedly dropped by the U.N climate summit in New York yesterday for 14 minutes. “He did not speak and left after listening to remarks from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor,” our colleagues Seung Min Kim and Anne Gearan report.

What Trump missed: “Leaders from France, Germany, India and other countries made public their commitment to increase renewable energy consumption and curb fossil fuel burning,” our colleagues write. He also missed an impassioned plea from teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.

For a minute there, it looked like Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 campaign would burst into flames five feet above its launchpad. The senator began her presidential bid by attempting to nullify one of her conspicuous liabilities — only to amplify that liability, amuse conservatives, and alienate indigenous groups. Within months, her finance director had quit, and her top left-wing rival had out fundraised her by an order of magnitude. Then, Joe Biden made his candidacy official, and promptly opened up a 30-point lead over the Massachusetts senator.

Nevertheless, she persisted. And with a little over four months before Iowa gets caucusing, Warren’s prospects have radically changed. As of this writing, betting markets now consider her by far the most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination. For months now, each wave of new polling has shown her star steadily rising both nationally and in early primary states. And the latest batch of surveys is no exception.

A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds Warren’s support nationally climbing from 19 percent in August to 27 percent today — a large enough gain to put her ahead of Biden in that survey for the first time ever. Meanwhile, a new UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll of the California primary suggests Warren has gained 11 points in the Golden State since June, giving her a commanding lead over the rest of the field. Meanwhile, the most recent data from the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire comport with this general trend.

But the best news for Warren in these polls may lay beneath the headline data. Here are five quick takeaways from the last week of polling that bode well for Warren’s odds of facing Trump next November:

1) Biden is bending, and just might break.

If you only looked at the national polling averages, Uncle Joe would appear to be in very solid shape. RealClearPolitics’s poll of polls has Biden boasting 29 percent support, which is just a tiny shade beneath where he’s typically been over the past three months; in other words, the national data shows no steep or uniform decline in Biden’s standing.

But in the early voting states — where each campaign’s resources have been concentrated — the picture looks much dimmer for the former vice-president. At the start of July, Biden’s average support in Iowa was 26 percent; today, it’s just 20. Warren now leads the field in the Hawkeye State by nearly three points in RCP’s polling average. And surveys from New Hampshire tell a similar story: As of mid-July, Biden was leading Warren there by an average of 22 points; now, he leads by an average of three. And Monmouth University poll released this week has Warren ahead of him by two.

Meanwhile, the national landscape may be in the process of converging on Iowa and New Hampshire’s: In Quinnipiac’s newly released national poll, Biden’s support is 7 percent lower than it was in the same survey one month ago. Other pollsters have documented declines in the percentage of Biden supporters who are “enthusiastic” about their candidate. Finally, there are some non-empirical reasons to think the former vice president’s standing will continue to erode. Thus far, Biden has benefited from the perception that he would be a uniquely “electable” nominee. But the increasingly conspicuous decline in his verbal skills — combined with the fact that the Democrats’ newly launched impeachment push is sure to call attention to his son Hunter’s influence-peddling (and Trump’s ostensibly, wildly false allegation that Biden corruptly intervened to fire a Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into Hunter’s company) — could erode Biden’s claim to being the Democrats’ “safe” option.

2) Warren’s base of support appears to be diversifying.

For most of the campaign, one of Warren’s apparent weaknesses was her coalition’s demographic homogeneity: She commanded the adoration of college-educated whites, but piddling levels of support among most other parts of the Democratic coalition.

This fact lent itself to two competing interpretations:

1) Something about Warren’s persona or program made her a niche candidate, who was already near her ceiling of support (there being only so many white professionals in blue America) and would thus fade away.

or

2) College-educated whites were more likely than other Democrats to be paying close attention to the primary race. Thus, Warren’s poor showing with nonwhite, and non-college-educated voters merely reflected the fact that her name was not as widely recognized as Joe Biden’s or Bernie Sanders’s. And if this were the case, then her strong support among college-educated whites might actually be a leading indicator of her appeal to the broader Democratic coalition: Once other groups began tuning in to this year’s race, they too would see the same things that had made “Patagonia Democrats” swoon.

While there may be an element of truth to No. 1 (Warren does appear to be especially appealing to Democrats who share her skin tone and academic pedigree), recent polling data has made the second look increasingly plausible. Quinnipiac’s new national poll show’s Warren’s coalition diversifying in both racial and class terms. In fact, the Q-poll has Warren beating Biden among white voters without a college degree by a remarkable 37 to 20 percent margin.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

New Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Warren making inroads among black voters:



July:

Biden 53%

Warren 4%



August:

Biden 47%

Warren 8%



Now:

Biden 40%

Warren 19% — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 25, 2019

The Los Angeles Times poll of California tells a similar story. After performing poorly with non-college whites in the same poll back in June, Warren now claims 29 percent of the demographic’s vote, while Sanders and Biden respectively boast 20 and 18 percent. And although Biden still leads the field with 40 percent support among African-American voters, Warren now has 24 percent support among that key demographic in California, putting her in second with that constituency.

But there’s even more direct evidence that Warren’s real base isn’t college-educated white voters, so much as it is voters who are paying attention: In the progressive think-tank Data For Progress’s polling of the 2020 primary, Warren consistently performs best among voters express a high level of interest in the news — including non-college-educated and non-white news junkies.

3) Harris 2020 (almost certainly) isn’t happening.

For a brief period in early July, Kamala Harris led both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in national polls. The California senator also boasted considerable support among professional Democrats and liberal donors. Many observers expected her to emerge as Biden’s main rival. But she’s proven to be the 2020 version of Scott Walker — a candidate with strong Establishment support who makes a lot of sense on paper, but never made much headway with actual voters. Quinnipiac now pegs Harris’s support at a mere 3 percent; her average in national polls is 5 percent. Critically, her numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost identical to her national figures. Unless she orchestrates an improbable comeback in one of those early states, Harris could be forced to euthanize her campaign by early March, leaving Warren the only viable option for Democrats who wish to elect a female president.

4) Warren is acceptable to a broader range of Democratic voters than any of her rivals.

Both the Quinnipiac national poll, and Los Angeles Times California survey, show Warren with a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than Biden or Sanders. And the Times finds that nearly 70 percent of California Democrats rank Warren as their first or second choice. Those results are consistent with a Data For Progress/Civiqs national poll released earlier this month, which showed Warren as the most popular second choice among Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris voters. And several other surveys have produced similar findings. This obviously bodes well for Warren if and when the Democratic field narrows, and suggests that a contested convention, she may have a strong claim to being a “unity” figure.

5) Sanders is stagnating.

Bernie Sanders’s campaign is very much alive. The Vermont senator’s has amassed enviable donor and volunteer networks, and has led in multiple recent polls of early primary states. Still, Sanders’s support has been stagnant nationally for months now, while his average share of the vote in Iowa has fallen from 19 percent in July to 12 percent today. Given that the senator is already well-known among Democratic primary voters, it is not clear how much room he has to grow. Sanders has made no secret of the fact that he favors Warren over his other primary rivals. So, it is at least possible to imagine a scenario in which Sanders’s campaign runs out of steam by next April, and then throws its considerable resources behind Warren.

Of course, Warren’s nomination remains far from a sure thing. Biden’s numbers are still formidable. Sanders is still within striking distance. And it’s still early. But at this point, there’s a strong case that Warren is the candidate you’d want to be."

The dam is bursting, the floodgates are opening, the horse is out of the barn. Choose whichever metaphor you want — the point is that news of President Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden has supercharged Democratic support for impeachment proceedings — to the point that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon.

What stands out about the latest crop of converts to the cause is how many are from swing congressional districts — the kinds of places where bringing charges against the president may be a far riskier political gamble than in safe Democratic areas, given that impeachment has consistently lacked majority support in national polls. The lack of enthusiasm from representatives in these districts is one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been so unenthusiastic about triggering the procedure over Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction in the Russia investigation.

But the Ukraine story seems to be different. Here’s a running list of lawmakers joining the impeachment push.

House Democrats Newly in Favor of Impeachment

At least 20 House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment for the first time in just the past two days, bringing the total number of representatives on board to 174 Democrats out of 235, according to Politico’s running counter.

On Monday, Congresswoman Angie Craig, who represents a Minnesota district Trump carried by a point, said she is onboard with impeachment.

Later that night, seven freshman Democrats wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which they deemed Trump’s actions a possible threat to national security. Four of them — Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria, Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill — represent districts Trump carried in 2016.

Here's how Trump did in the Impeachment 7 op-ed writers' districts in 2016:



Spanberger VA-7 Trump +7

Slotkin MI-8 Trump +7

Luria VA-2 Trump +4

Sherrill NJ-11 Trump +1

Cisneros CA-39 Clinton +9

Crow CO-6 Clinton +9

Houlahan PA-6 Clinton +10



AVG: Clinton +1 — Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) September 24, 2019

On Tuesday morning, New York’s Antonio Delgado joined the impeachment bandwagon. Delgado defeated incumbent Republican John Faso in an upstate district that voted for Trump by more than six points.

Some lawmakers appeared to be shifting on impeachment, but didn’t endorse it outright — yet. Texas’s Colin Allred said if the Trump administration doesn’t turn over the full report of the whistle-blower who alerted the government to Trump’s alleged misconduct, he would support impeachment. In 2018, Allred defeated a longtime Republican incumbent in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton by just two points.

Later, Texas representative Lizzie Fletcher announced her support as well. Fletcher’s district narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 but hadn’t been represented by a Democrat in Congress since 1967.

The facts we have learned recently are matters of utmost importance for our national security, country, and Constitution. The House should act swiftly to investigate and should be prepared to use the remedy exclusively in its power: impeachment.



See my full statement here: pic.twitter.com/xho0DlD107 — Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (@RepFletcher) September 24, 2019

Two representatives from Nevada, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, followed suit.

Lee’s district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016.

Haley Stevens of Michigan, who won a district that Trump carried by five points, wrote that “if investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offenses that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Also on Tuesday, civil-rights icon John Lewis announced his support for impeachment from the House floor.

Breaking. Rep. John Lewis just now on the House floor: ""I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy."" — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 24, 2019

Other Democrats who joined the herd include New York’s Joe Morelle and Michigan’s Debbie Dingell, Tennessee’s Jim Cooper, and Florida’s Donna Shalala and Lois Frankel, Pennsylvania’s Susan Wild, and Iowa’s Cindy Axne.

As a rough measure of swing-district support, just five Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016 had endorsed impeachment before this week, according to Politico; now that number is up to 13 and is likely to rise.

These lawmakers’ decisions were apparently not triggered by House leadership in any way, making them all the more significant.

As one Dem operative notes, this is the opposite of how Hill votes usually pile up: there is NO whipping from leadership, it’s rank and file members coordinating w one another, swallowing and stepping out there. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

While most of the action was in the House on Tuesday, the Democrats’ second-in-command in the Senate, Dick Durbin, joined in as well.

Today, I am calling for the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives of President Donald Trump. — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) September 24, 2019

Non-Democrats in Favor of Impeachment

So far, only one non-Democrat in Congress supports impeachment: Michigan representative Justin Amash, who switched his party registration from Republican to Independent earlier this year after declaring that Trump should be investigated. On Tuesday, he reiterated his call to action in an effort to nudge his erstwhile Republican colleagues.

Just do what is right. Stop waiting for others to act first. Take responsibility for yourself and set an example. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 24, 2019

There is no sign that any House Republicans will join Amash.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has appeared surprisingly eager to cooperate with Democrats, at least on the narrow matter of getting to the bottom of what the whistleblower actually said.

MCCONNELL has hotlined the resolution calling for the release of the whistleblower report. Schumer asking for unanimous consent for its passsage. — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019

One Republican, Mitt Romney, has expressed serious consternation over Trump’s behavior.

If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019

When asked about impeachment on Tuesday — hours after Trump had mocked him on Twitter — Romney didn’t rule it out.

Romney on impeachment: “it’s early to be having those conversations. There’s so much we don’t know” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 24, 2019

Some other Republicans, like Marco Rubio, have downplayed the allegations against Trump.

Democratic Presidential Candidates in Favor of Impeachment

Of the major presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, and Tom Steyer have previously called on Congress to impeach Trump. Pete Buttigieg has said Trump “deserves impeachment” but has stopped short of endorsing it. Bernie Sanders had also avoided a full-throated endorsement until Tuesday:

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.



Enough is enough.



I hope the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House will begin the impeachment process. pic.twitter.com/WHth62v5br — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Joe Biden, who is at the center of the Ukraine scandal, has so far resisted calls to impeach. But on Tuesday, he said that if the Trump administration does not cooperate with Democrats’ demands for full access to the whistle-blower’s complaint, he’s on board.

Joe Biden: If Pres. Trump doesn't give Congress documents on Ukraine, Trump will leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy ""of his own making.”



""We know who Donald Trump is. It is time to let the world know who we are."" — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 24, 2019

Other candidates are reaffirming their belief that Trump should face charges.

The House must impeach. It must start today. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 24, 2019

Enough. It’s time to impeach. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019

If we allow the president to get away with the crimes he’s committed, then we will set the precedent that some people are above the law. And then, this democracy will be lost to us forever.



It’s time for Speaker Pelosi and the House to do their job. — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 24, 2019

The early state polling drought in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest really does seem to be ending. After this weekend’s gold-standard Selzer poll from Iowa, today we received results from high-quality polls in New Hampshire (Monmouth) and Nevada (USA Today/Suffolk).

The most immediate news in this mini-harvest of public opinion is that the Monmouth poll qualified a 12th candidate for the October Democratic debates in Ohio by taking 2 percent, Tulsi Gabbard now has met the four-poll 2 percent threshold. This development all but eliminates any doubts that this round of debates will again be a two-day affair, after the brief bliss of ten candidates fitting on the same stage in Houston earlier this month.

The same poll, though, continues a string of bad results for Bernie Sanders in terms of his standing in early states vis-à-vis his progressive rival Elizabeth Warren. Monmouth has Warren now edging Joe Biden in the Granite State by a 27-25 margin — but with Sanders down to 12 percent, just ahead of Pete Buttigieg with 10 percent. This is extremely similar to what Selzer found in Iowa (Warren 22 percent, Biden 20 percent, Sanders 11 percent, Buttigieg 9 percent). That makes any suspicion (based on an national poll in August showing Warren in a three-way tie with Biden and Sanders) that Monmouth is somehow putting a thumb on the scales for Warren a non-starter. The USA Today/Suffolk poll of Nevada shows Biden still in the lead with 23 percent, but Sanders at 14 percent is trailing Warren’s 19 percent by a significant margin. Indeed, as Nate Silver pointed out (a bit too avidly, you might say, but accurately), poor early state poll numbers for Sanders are becoming too routine for comfort:

This is a list Bernie Sanders' standing in all early- state polls since the Houston debate



IA: 9% (David Binder Research)

IA: 11% (Selzer)

NH: 12% (Monmouth)

NV: 14% (Suffolk)

IA: 16% (Civiqs) — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 24, 2019

As a reminder, Sanders won nearly half the vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2016, along with 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.

Like his fellow late-septuagenarian Joe Biden, Sanders is doing quite a bit better in national polls. The latest RealClearPolitics averages have Biden at 30 percent, Warren at 20 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent, with Buttigieg way back at 6 percent. But the trends aren’t great for Bernie. For months one of his bulwarks was the vast Morning Consult tracking poll. He’s now fallen behind Warren there, too.

Aside from the good news for Gabbard concerning the October debates, we are now in the window when selected polls will count toward qualification for the November debate, too. With today’s releases, there are now two national qualifying polls and three from the early states, with the threshold now up to a three percent showing in four national and/or early state polls, or 5 percent from two early state polls. The Big Three plus Buttigieg and Harris are hitting these thresholds routinely, but among the iffier candidates, it’s notable that Booker and Yang now have two qualifying polls, while Klobuchar, O’Rourke, and Steyer have just one (September debate participant Julian Castro has been skunked so far, as has Gabbard, whose qualifying number from Monmouth for October fell short of the November threshold).

We’re probably looking at a single night of debates in November, but the thing to watch is whether the current Big Three of Biden, Warren, and Sanders is looking more like a Big Two with Bernie slipping back and perhaps some other candidate coming on."

Amid the intense blowback over Knowles’s remarks Monday night after a clip of the show went viral, Fox News apologized to Thunberg.

“The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful — we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers,” a spokesperson for the network told The Washington Post in a statement.

Fox News also said it has “no plans” to book Knowles.

Knowles did not respond to a request for comment late Monday but defended himself on Twitter, writing: “There is nothing shameful about living with mental disorders. What is shameful is exploiting a child — particularly a child with mental disorders — to advance your political agenda.”

Thunberg has called the condition a “gift” and credited it with sparking her activism.

“Some people mock me for my diagnosis. But Asperger is not a disease, it’s a gift. People also say that since I have Asperger I couldn’t possibly have put myself in this position. But that’s exactly why I did this,” she wrote on Facebook in February. “Because if I would have been ‘normal’ and social I would have organized myself in an organisation, or started an organisation by myself. But since I am not that good at socializing I did this instead. I was so frustrated that nothing was being done about the climate crisis and I felt like I had to do something, anything.”

The network’s apology comes as conservatives have ramped up their broadsides against Thunberg, who traveled to the United States earlier this month on a solar-powered sailboat and has since been chastising powerful politicians about their inaction on climate change. In a widely reviled tweet over the weekend, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza compared Thunberg to young people featured in Nazi propaganda, sharing a photo of the Swedish teen alongside an illustration of a Caucasian girl sporting braided hair and holding a Nazi flag. On Monday, Sebastian Gorka, the former Breitbart editor and White House aide, labeled Thunberg as an “autist child.”

Even President Trump weighed in late Monday with a tweet that many took as sarcastic.

“She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,” Trump tweeted shortly after 11:30 p.m., sharing a video of Thunberg delivering her fiery address at the U.N. climate summit. “So nice to see!”

Knowles made his statements about Thunberg while appearing on the “The Story with Martha MacCallum,” and his description of the teenager instantly sparked a rebuke from liberal radio host Christopher Hahn, who had also been invited on as a guest.

“How dare you?” Hahn could be heard interjecting.

When Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner, who was filling in for MacCallum, gave Hahn the floor, he tore into Knowles.

AD

“You’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child,” Hahn said. “Shame on you.”

The pair then began talking over each other as Knowles insisted he wasn’t going after Thunberg, but rather “attacking the left for exploiting a mentally ill child.”

“Now, relax, skinny boy,” Hahn barked, eliciting a noise of surprise from Faulkner and a chuckle from Knowles. “Have some couth when you’re on television. Maybe on your podcast you get away and say whatever you want because nobody’s listening. You’re on national television. Be a grown-up when you’re talking about children.”

Hahn later added: “You are despicable for talking about her like that. You should apologize on national television right now.”

AD

Meanwhile, Knowles stuck to his talking point that Thunberg is “mentally ill,” pointing to a family memoir that recounted details from the teenager’s childhood.

“She has autism,” he said. “She has obsessive compulsive disorder. She has selective mutism. She had depression. Her mother wrote about this in a book.”

Ignoring Hahn’s barbs, Knowles told the radio host, “You can inveigh all you want, but unfortunately, you don’t have many facts on your side.”

The heated exchange, which lasted more than two minutes, quickly spread on social media Monday night. By early Tuesday, one video of the short segment had amassed more than 1.6 million views.

Critics denounced Knowles’s comments, which also drew swift backlash from autism advocacy organizations.

AD

AD

“To intentionally demean any person, regardless of neuro-diversity, is both cruel and wrong,” the Autism Society said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. “Certainly some might disagree with Ms. Thunberg on policy issues, but it is shameful to issue a derogatory statement to a youth advocate.”

Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, told THR that it is “absolutely unconscionable to attack someone for their disability, especially when that person is a child.”

“History is full of autistic people and people with other cognitive disabilities who were and are compelling, credible activists and leaders,” Bascom said. “Greta is a part of that tradition, and our community is lucky to have her. Period.”

But others supported Knowles, including fellow conservative pundit Ann Coulter.

Despite Fox News’s apology, the segment featuring Knowles and Hahn wasn’t the last time Monday night that Thunberg was mentioned on the network.

Hours later on her show, Fox News host Laura Ingraham played a clip of Thunberg speaking at the climate summit and compared the teen to characters in the 1984 horror film “Children of the Corn,” based off a novel by Stephen King.

“I can’t wait for Stephen King’s sequel, ‘Children of the Climate,’” Ingraham said.

AD

The list of Democrats calling for Trump’s impeachment has been bolstered in recent days by revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in a phone call that took place shortly after Trump had temporarily suspended military aid to the country.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to pressure a foreign power to hurt Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender. Trump has acknowledged he held back the aid, but denies doing anything improper. On Tuesday, he said he was concerned the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries. He has previously said he was worried about corruption in Ukraine.

In surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.

AD

When matched against four other Democratic candidates — Sen. Warren Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — Trump did not have an advantage against any of them. At best he trailed within the range of sampling error.

Recent polling has also shown Trump without a clear lead against top Democrats in several of the mostly closely contested states in 2016.

AD

In Michigan, for instance, an EPIC-MRA poll in August asked whether registered voters would support Trump against four different Democratic candidates.

Trump trailed Biden by 10 points, a statistically significant edge. Warren and Sanders held slight edges over Trump of 4 points and 5 points, respectively, while Harris had a 3-point lead, which was within the margin of error.

In Wisconsin, a Marquette Law School poll in August found Trump tied or behind Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris among registered voters. Biden led Trump by 9 points; Sanders had a slight 4-point edge, while Warren and Harris were tied with Trump.

We now have the readout of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and, as damning as it is, we still await the whistleblower complaint that put us on the road to impeachment, which Trump administration is withholding from Congress.

Which brings us to one William P. Barr, the attorney general of the United States and someone who has proven that there are almost no lengths he will not go to in order to protect President Trump.

AD

AD

What we have learned so far raises the possibility — even if at the moment nothing has been proven and we have more questions than answers — that Barr could be involved in the president’s wrongdoing, an attempt to cover up that wrongdoing, or both.

First, note that in his phone call with Zelensky, Trump repeatedly said that he wanted Barr involved in the effort to dig up dirt to use against Joe Biden.

First, Trump brought up CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company that helped investigate the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, in an apparent reference to some ludicrous right-wing conspiracy theory. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said. They then moved on to the subject of Biden, and Trump said that “I will ask [Rudolph W. Giuliani] to call you along with the Attorney General.”

AD

AD

Trump went on: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”

And then again: “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to [have] Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.” And then one more time: “I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.”

As Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a news conference Wednesday, Trump invoking Barr “adds another layer of depravity to this conversation,” because it made clear that the U.S. government and Trump’s personal attorney would be working together to force Ukraine to aid Trump’s reelection bid.

AD

Which raises some questions. We know that Giuliani pressured Ukraine to open an investigation that might produce some dirt on Biden and his son. Was Barr involved, as the president wanted? Did he communicate with any Ukrainian officials? Did he have any communication with Giuliani, who was apparently running a kind of shadow State Department? And if Barr did, what could that possibly have to do with his job as America’s chief law enforcement official?

AD

The Justice Department just issued a denial, saying Trump never asked Barr to get involved with Ukraine. Even if that’s true (and let’s just say we should keep an open mind), Barr’s part in this story doesn’t end there.

On Tuesday, Schiff sent a remarkable letter to the attorney general, in which he raised the possibility that the Justice Department “has participated in a dangerous cover-up to protect the President.”

AD

To remind you, when a whistleblower files a complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, the IG determines if the complaint is credible and is of “urgent concern.” If it is, the director of national intelligence then must pass it on to the intelligence committees. Not if the DNI wants to, not if he thinks it has merit, not if he’s in the mood — the DNI “shall” give it to Congress, the law states. But he didn’t.

AD

Why? The Justice Department gave the DNI a written legal opinion justifying his refusal to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint. In his letter, Schiff asks why this happened, suggesting that the Justice Department shouldn’t have overridden what the IG’s conclusion requires the DNI to do:

In effect, the Department appears to have usurped the IC IG’s fact-finding role in an unprecedented manner, and then disguised its reversal of the IC IG’s findings in a purportedly non-partisan legal opinion from the OLC.

In what Schiff referred to in his news conference as a “completely contorted rationalization,” they said that in fact this whole matter was outside the purview of the intelligence community, and therefore it doesn’t constitute an “urgent concern,” and therefore the DNI doesn’t have to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint to Congress.

AD

The Justice Department is run by William Barr, and given the magnitude of this matter, it seems impossible that at a minimum he wouldn’t have been kept informed of every development. What was his role in the production of the opinion telling the DNI to keep the whistleblower’s complaint secret?

AD

At this point we should remind ourselves that the entire reason Barr is attorney general is that he made clear that, unlike his predecessor, he would make protecting Trump his highest priority.

One can’t help but be reminded of the surreal moment at a Senate hearing in May when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) asked Barr if the president or anyone else in the White House had asked or suggested that he open an investigation of anyone. At first, Barr pretended that he didn’t understand the question, as though it were too complex to grasp. Then he spent long seconds gazing into space and muttering before finally claiming he just didn’t know whether that had happened or not.

AD

Perhaps we’ll be able to find out. One thing we know for sure is that if Donald Trump wanted to use the powers of government to cover up his misdeeds, William Barr would be the first person he’d call.

A confused reader passed along a tweet with a clip of these remarks. What was Biden talking about?

AD

After all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.

AD

Biden’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:

He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.

He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: “It’s going to cost you in your pay — there will be a deductible in your paycheck”).

He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not “5 percent and 4 percent.”

We understand politicians can misspeak — though Biden seems to do it more often than most — so we won’t be awarding Pinocchios. But the point he was trying to make gets to the heart of the debate about the cost of a single-payer health plan. So it’s worth exploring this issue and explaining it to readers, especially because more than 100,000 people watched the video embedded in the tweet.

AD

The Facts

Sanders, as Biden noted, has said his plan will raise taxes, but argues that the cost of health care will be lower overall. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), rising fast in the polls, has embraced Sanders’s plan but studiously avoids answering any questions about a possible tax increase. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) used to support the Sanders plan but then crafted her own version, in part because of what she called “a middle-class tax hike” embedded in the plan. Her plan would phase in much more slowly and still retain a role for private insurance.

AD

Biden has rejected a single-payer approach and advocated building on the Affordable Care Act, the law expanding health-care access passed during the Obama administration.

AD

Actually, no one really knows what would happen. You have to take any of the numbers offered by advocates and detractors with a huge grain of salt. As we have documented before, the cost of any health-care proposal will be affected by a variety of factors, including provider payments, health-care benefits, cost-sharing and administrative savings from a consolidated system. Any complex bill overhauling health care faces daunting prospects in a closely divided Congress.

But for the sake of argument, let’s look at the numbers Biden and Sanders are using.

Sanders has offered a menu of possible options to finance the cost of Medicare-for-all. One option would require a 7.5 percent payroll tax that employers would pay to help fund the program. Another would be a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households. (That’s what Harris labeled a middle-class tax hike.)

AD

AD

But Sanders argues that those taxes would be cheaper than the current system.

Sanders offers as an example a prototypical family of four earning $50,000. He says the employer is currently paying $12,865 a year in health-care premiums for this family, while the family pays $5,277 in premiums. Virtually every economist will tell you that payroll taxes or health-insurance premiums paid by an employer largely comes out of the pay earned by the employee.

For instance, both employers and employees pay 6.2 percent to Social Security (on the first $132,900 of wages) and 1.45 percent to Medicare. The employer obviously counts that 7.65 percent ($3,825 for a $50,000 wage) as part of the cost of employing that person, as well as the nearly $13,000 in health insurance premiums. To the employer, the cost of that employee is not $50,000, but almost $67,000. (There are tax deductions for employer-provided health insurance, but we will ignore them as part of this illustration.)

AD

AD

But note that almost $13,000 in insurance premiums is 26 percent of $50,000. Sanders’s 7.5 percent tax would be $3,750, so that suggests more than $9,000 in savings for the employer. Under Medicare-for-all, the total cost of the employee to the employer would be a little over $57,000, a reduction of more than $9,000.

As for the 4 percent income premium paid by the employee, that amounts to $844 a year, once the standard deduction is taken into account, Sanders says. That’s far less than the nearly $5,300 in premiums currently paid by this family.

Biden, by contrast, only focuses on the cost of tax increase (apparently because polling has found that it’s a way to undercut support for Medicare-for-all). In the debate, Biden argued that a three-person family earning $60,000 a year will face more than $5,000 in taxes — the 4 percent premium tax ($1,240 after the standard deduction) and the 7.5 percent tax paid by employers ($4,500), on the widely accepted economic theory that payroll taxes paid by employers are passed onto employees.

AD

AD

Notice that he did not take into account any of the savings that Sanders claims his plan will generate both for the employee and employer. So he’s really only telling half the story, misleadingly ignoring a possible reduction in health-care costs for many Americans.

Sanders also chose an example in which the numbers work in his favor. The savings for the employer fade as an employee’s wages increase.

Sanders also focuses on the cost of a family plan, which has much higher premiums. The Milliman Medical Index, a respected accounting of health-care costs, says the employer contribution in 2019 will be $3,773 per person. (Total health-care costs for a family of four on an employer-provided plan are $28,386, Milliman says.) So a single person making $50,000 in theory would barely represent any savings for that employer — a 7.5 percent payroll tax on $50,000 is $3,750 — and the tax would quickly be higher than current expenses as wages increase.

AD

AD

Similarly, wealthier Americans would end up paying much more in taxes than they currently pay for health-care premiums. (We take no position on whether that’s good or bad, and certainly Sanders and Warren have been forthright in saying the wealthy would largely finance the plan.)

The uncertain complexity was examined in a 2018 University of Massachusetts at Amherst study that predicted the impact of enacting Medicare-for-all in a variety of employer and employee scenarios. The report does not examine all of the same financing options as Sanders, but it calculated that a three-person family with $60,000 income would gain almost $1,600 (2.6 percent) in additional income under Medicare-for-all, while a family with income of $221,000 (top 20 percent of wages earners), would lose $8,520 (3.9 percent) and a family with $401,000 (top 5 percent) would lose $22,340 (5.6 percent). (To create these scenarios, the report relies on data for 2016 mean incomes for various income ranges.)

Meanwhile, the report said most businesses would see a reduction in costs with even an 8.2 percent payroll tax but that firms of more than 500 employees would experience a 5.7 percent increase in health-care costs.

AD

AD

“Vice President Biden’s priority as president will be to make sure every single American has access to affordable, quality health insurance in the quickest, most cost-effective way possible,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. “That’s why his plan is to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option, allowing people to choose between this new option and their private plan, and taking other steps to lower health-care costs. Biden has also made clear that any health-care plan that raises taxes on the middle class is a nonstarter.”

The Bottom Line

Biden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders’s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It’s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation, and we will keep an eye on how Biden frames this in the future to see if he merits Pinocchios.

AD

Biden may have bungled his lines at the town hall, but he still has not developed an effective or sophisticated counterargument to Sanders’s prediction of lower overall costs. You can understand why Warren has generally refused to even acknowledge that there are higher taxes embedded in Medicare-for-all. She stays focused instead on an overall reduction in costs, clearly not wanting to engage in a debate on Biden’s playing field.

The Justice Department is trying to deny Barr has any role in this fiasco. (“An initial Justice Department statement on Barr’s role issued at the same moment the call notes were made public seemed only to rule out the attorney general being asked to work with Ukraine on such a probe, but a subsequent clarification broadened the denial to cover any presidential request to Barr to launch an inquiry into Biden.”) Even if this is true, the Justice Department found there was nothing wrong with Trump’s conduct. Are we to believe Barr didn’t know about that either? Constitutional scholar Larry Tribe tells me, “It’s inconceivable that Barr didn’t know, and the decision to treat the president’s manifestly criminal conversation with Ukraine’s leader, a mix of bribery and extortion, as not worthy of a referral for further investigation seems to me inexplicable unless one assumes either corrupt motives or gross stupidity or both.”

Barr is not the only member of the administration who is in legal and career peril. Most importantly, it is essential to determine what Vice President Pence knew of Trump’s efforts, whether he advised against this kind of conduct and whether he was involved in the pressure campaign to find dirt on Biden. When we move into the realm of impeachment, it is obviously necessary to determine if the vice president, in case of removal or resignation, is fit to take over. Congress should move swiftly to subpoena him and obtain all documents relating to this travesty.

Indeed, anyone who facilitated the aid for dirt campaign should be identified and compelled to step down. Whether it was acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney who inserted himself into the aid process by arranging a holdup of funds to Ukraine or Defense or State officials who carried out these directives or had knowledge of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s private secretary of state operation, they must be identified and their conduct evaluated.

AD

AD

It is noteworthy that we now learn that, according to The Post, acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire ""threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” This suggests two things: First, the White House was engaged in an attempt to obstruct Congress’s investigation, and, second, it is possible for officials to resist illegal or immoral orders.

As we learn the full extent of this assault on our electoral system, we will see just how far the culpability extends. Their decision to stay in the administration and serve an unfit and reckless president might have lifelong consequences for a whole bunch of people.

DECORAH, Iowa — The crowd that came to see Bernie Sanders was too big for Luther College's gym. It spilled over into a yard, where the senator delivered a short version of his stump speech — “the fate of the planet is at stake, democracy is at stake” — before he walked into a room full of “Bernie Beats Trump” signs.

But not everyone who showed up was sold on that message.

“I'm not necessarily a Bernie fan,” said Justin Knautz, 20, who said he was leaning toward South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeg. “Even if he could beat Trump, which I'm not sure about, our country's so divided already.”

“I'm super confident that he'd win,” Avery Pazour, 20, said of Sanders. “Young people are tired of the system the way that it is.”

“I'm exactly the opposite,” said Marin Gabor, 21. “I like Pete Buttigieg's public-health option. I guess that's a weird thing for a young person to say?""

Five months after Sanders began arguing that he was the most electable Democratic candidate, a pitch he made with a tour of Rust Belt states, he has made little progress with voters terrified of a second Trump term. National and state polling has found Sanders persistently behind former vice president Joe Biden when voters are asked who has the best chance of defeating the president. In the past month, polling has found Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) roughly tied with Sanders on “electability.”

The “Bernie beats Trump” tour was the latest attempt to push back. That meant showing what a general election would look like, with the candidate leading raw, emotional town hall meetings where voters explained how the economic system failed them. It meant emphasizing that polling had shown him ahead of Trump in 2016 — an argument he briefly made to “superdelegates.” It meant reminding people that he had won the primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan, where some Democrats slept on the 2016 general election.

In Iowa, Sanders occasionally referred to the national and state polls that have shown him ahead of Trump, but in an interview, he waved off the polling that had shown Democratic voters still nervous about how a democratic socialist could take the presidency.

“I'm not much into all these speculations and all these polls,” Sanders said. “One day a poll has me doing great, the next day a poll has me doing terrible. It has a lot to do with who you're polling and what questions you're asking. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to win, because we have an extraordinary grass-roots movement.”

Apart from some turnover in its early state staff, the Sanders campaign has shown some broad support. It celebrated its 1 millionth individual donor last week; shortly after that, it drew an estimated 4,000 voters to a rally in Norman, Okla. (A 2016 rally in Tulsa, three times the size of Norman, had attracted a crowd of 11,000.)

But it has struggled to convince early-state voters that Sanders could win a general election, and the senator's support in early states has slipped since the start of his campaign. In interviews around the state, some at the senator from Vermont's rallies, voters sometimes praised Sanders or explained why they used to support him before laying out the reasons that they were supporting someone else.

“I love him. We caucused for him in 2016,” said Scott German, 50, who spent Monday evening at a rally for Buttigieg in Dubuque. “If he could win and put forward everything he's talking about, it'd be utopia. But I don't think America's ready for it. We need somebody more realistic.”

Sanders's campaign is combating the skepticism with a busy schedule and with sharp contrasts, some of them brighter than others. When Sanders announced his 1 millionth donor, campaign manager Faiz Shakir described him as “the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grass-roots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump” — a knock at Warren, who has said her no-fundraisers pledge applies to only the primary and who is headlining some fundraisers for the DNC.

Speech by speech, Sanders has structured an electability pitch around his brand — that of an Old Testament prophet who has been saying the same things about health care and economic fairness for 30 years. At four rallies on Monday, he emphasized that taxes would go up to pay for Medicare-for-all, encouraging the crowd to think about how the media would frame that.

“Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes! How terrible is this guy?” Sanders said sarcastically in Decorah, waving his arms and imitating a negative ad. The upshot: He was ready to handle the criticism, some candidates were not, and therefore, he could win.

That theory is getting a real-time test in Iowa, one that has not gone well for Sanders. His campaign believes that the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a front group for insurance companies, has done damage to his support among Democrats by running digital and TV ads attacking Medicare-for-all. (Sanders has not yet purchased TV time in early states.) The senator's favorable numbers have decreased since the spring, robbing supporters of something that was true for years: that he was the most popular politician in America.

“There's a lot of lies going on about this,” Sanders said in Dubuque. “There's the health-care industry that's already advertising in here in Iowa. Every time you see that ad, know who paid for that ad! It was paid for by the drug companies and the insurance companies who made a hundred billion in profits last year. They love the current system! They're scared to death that we have the momentum to move to Medicare-for-all.”

The insurance industry ads make good foils, but Sanders is just as happy to criticize Biden. After learning that a pollster at Anzalone Liszt Grove Research had been testing messages against Medicare-for-all — John Anzalone is an adviser to Biden — Sanders emphasized that he was collecting story after story of medical debt, denied coverage and personal pain. Even after his events ended, he was being buttonholed by people with insurance horror stories. At every event, Sanders sees a story that is not being told in the corporate media. As the nominee, with that media bound to cover him, he could cut through the fog, he believes.

“If Joe Biden or anybody else wants to use the Republican Party and the health-care industry talking points, I guess they can. But we're going to win this fight because we're going to refute that disingenuous attack,” Sanders said. “You know, I think when I raised the issue during the last debate, that we spend twice as much, Biden's response was, 'This is America.' Well, I don't know that Americans have to be chumps and to give the health-care industry $100 billion a year.”

Polling has found Democrats to be nervous about that argument, even if they agree with Sanders on the merits. In the Des Moines Register's weekend poll, a quarter of Democrats said they supported the concept of Medicare-for-all but were worried it was a general election loser — a threat to the entire Sanders premise.

At a Democratic meeting in Story County on Sunday, Linda Trudeau, 72, said that had never been convinced that Sanders could win. Warren had piqued her interest, she said, because she seemed liberal, but less stubborn.

“She's got to give up Medicare-for-all or she won't get elected,” said Trudeau. “She's not quite nailed down on that, unlike Bernie. That's a good thing.”

ON THE TRAIL

DUBUQUE, Iowa — First, there are the introductions from local Democrats. Then there’s the theme song — “High Hopes” by Panic! at the Disco, with a brass hook that tests the integrity of speakers and eardrums. Then the bus — a bus previously hired by everyone from Barack Obama to the producers of “Madam Secretary” — rolls into view. Only then does Pete Buttigieg race onto stage.

“Thanks for making me feel right at home!” Buttigieg told the crowd, 800 voters at an amphitheater on the banks of the Mississippi River. “You know, Dubuque has a great reputation among mayors — an example of a city leading the way, when Washington can’t get its act together.”

Buttigieg, one of the few Democrats whose favorability has increased over the primary campaign, is busy reintroducing himself as the candidate who can talk about anything — no gaffes, no dodges. On the bus, Buttigieg took questions on everything from college football (“problematic”) to how many white button-down shirts he owned (“a baker’s dozen”) to the violent abolitionist John Brown (“kind of a brutal guy”). When his Dubuque speech was over, Buttigieg worked the rope line for a half-hour, then walked over to the few reporters not on the bus to take more questions.

It wasn't an entirely new strategy. Buttigieg's early jump in the polls came after he did interview after interview, saying yes to TV shows and small outlets that were used to getting turned down. Most voters would not hear everything he said, but they could see that he was taking any questions.

The bus tour, and the entire media strategy, was also designed to show a contrast. The voters seen as most gettable for Buttigieg are moderates who have been disappointed by Joe Biden; the former vice president holds frequent media availabilities but has made a series of confusing statements, all of them amplified by social media.

Buttigieg's accessibility also contrasts with the candidates who've commanded the most attention so far, and for different reasons. Elizabeth Warren's short press gaggles are designed to make minimal news, and in the past week, she swerved back to a stock answer when asked whether her Medicare plans would raise “middle-class taxes” — something Buttigieg pounced on.

“Sen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question,” Buttigieg had told CNN before the start of the tour. “And we've seen that repeatedly.”

Buttigieg's approach also clashed with Kamala Harris, whose uneasy answers to some policy questions sapped her momentum, and with Bernie Sanders, who often urges reporters to steer back to his preferred topic instead of badgering him about the horse race or the latest Trump news. With that group of competitors, and with a support base that gushes about his ability to communicate, Buttigieg's advantage was clear: He could go on the record about anything. The comparison with other candidates would become obvious.

“I will explain how we will pay for every promise that I make,” Buttigieg said in Dubuque. “It's why I'm a little careful about the promises I do make.”

On the stump, Buttigieg did not mention rival candidates by name. “I think I've named my disagreements with their plans at various times,” he explained afterward. Other candidates, such as Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, have also described their plans as realistic, or truth-telling — candidates who promise more than could probably pass, or plans that aren't fully paid for, get described as less straightforward. Asked whether he would rule out any middle-class tax increases, Buttigieg emphasized that nothing he was for had required them.

“Everything that we've rolled out to date can be achieved without a middle-class tax increase, and we're going to make sure that it's clear how the revenue side will work,” he said. “It does mean tax increases for the top 2 percent. It will mean a wealth tax or something like it. It can certainly mean closing corporate tax loopholes.”

How far would the transparency go? Several campaigns lagging behind Buttigieg have criticized him for holding so many fundraisers. Unlike Biden, who has faced the same criticism, Buttigieg has not let the media in to cover those fundraisers.

“We're open to thinking about it,” he said. “I think right now we're focused on what we can achieve on the bus tour, because it's just a different conversation than any other format that we have. But the team will always evaluate strategy and other ideas.”

POLL WATCH

New Hampshire Democratic primary (Monmouth, 401 likely Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 27% ( 19)

Joe Biden — 25% (-9)

Bernie Sanders — 12% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg — 10% ( 1)

Kamala Harris — 3% (-3)

Cory Booker — 2% (-)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 2)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% (-)

Tom Steyer — 2% ( 2)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Beto O’Rourke — 1% (-1)

Marianne Williamson — 1% ( 1)

Polling in the first primary state has found (with different methodology) everything from a sizable lead for Bernie Sanders to resilient support for Joe Biden. This is the first major poll to find Elizabeth Warren positioned in the lead, albeit within the margin of error; more important is her favorable rating, which has risen since May from a net 39 points to a net 55 points, higher than any other candidate. Warren's strength extends even to voters who disagree with her on health care; she wins 40 percent of Democrats who, like she, support single-payer, but wins 25 percent among Democrats who support a ""public option"" instead. Warren's positioning might be helping her; she has endorsed a bevy of liberal health-care bills and is not as strongly associated as Sanders with Medicare-for-all.

Nevada Democratic caucus (Suffolk, 500 likely voters)

Joe Biden — 23%

Elizabeth Warren — 19%

Bernie Sanders — 14%

Kamala Harris — 4%

Pete Buttigieg — 3%

Cory Booker — 3%

Tom Steyer — 3%

Andrew Yang — 3%

Tulsi Gabbard — 1%

Michael Bennet — 1%

Beto O’Rourke — 1%

Julián Castro — 1%

The least-visited early state — even Democrats sometimes forget that it caucuses before South Carolina votes — has no obvious favorite. A tiny plurality of voters said that Elizabeth Warren did worse than they expected in the September debate; a tiny plurality said that Joe Biden did worse than they expected.

DEBATE SEASON

The fifth DNC debates, which will be held sometime in November, will introduce new, strict thresholds for entry in the latest effort to limit the party's biggest nights to candidates with widespread support. The short version: Candidates will need 165,000 individual donations (up from 130,000) to get space onstage, and polling at 2 percent won't cut it anymore.

In the new rules, candidates can reach the polling threshold in two ways: by hitting 3 percent in four polls (or more) recognized by the DNC or by hitting 5 percent in two (or more) polls taken in the first four primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The count started Sept. 13; it'll stop seven days before the date of the fifth debate, which has not yet been announced.

The DNC is transparent about which polls it counts. They are: the Associated Press; ABC News-Washington Post; CBS News-YouGov; CNN; Des Moines Register; Fox News; Monmouth University; NPR; NBC News-Wall Street Journal; NBC News-Marist; New York Times; Quinnipiac University; University of New Hampshire; USA Today-Suffolk University; and Winthrop University, which polls in South Carolina.

At the moment, using these standards, just five candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Just four other candidates have claimed to reach that new donor threshold: Tom Steyer, Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang.

2020

Joe Biden. He gave a prepared statement in Wilmington, Del., addressing the Ukraine saga more fully by saying no allegation about his son Hunter had merit and that the president was setting himself on a course to impeachment: “a tragedy of his own making.”

Tulsi Gabbard. She qualified for the fourth Democratic debate, after notching her fourth poll at 2 percent support — the Monmouth poll from New Hampshire. That significantly ups the chances of CNN, the debate's TV host, splitting the debate into two nights, each with six candidates.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a new version of a “wealth tax,” a concept that he had introduced five years ago but that Elizabeth Warren had formulated for this presidential campaign. Unlike Warren's 2 percent tax (which has been strong when polled), Sanders's would tackle wealth in tiers: a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million, a 4 percent tax on net worth between $500 million and $1 billion, a 5 percent tax on net worth between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, a 6 percent tax on net worth between $2.5 billion $5 billion, a 7 percent tax on net worth between $5 billion and $10 billion, and an 8 percent tax on net worth above $10 billion.

Elizabeth Warren. She'll return to New Hampshire on Wednesday and Friday, her first visits to the state since shifts in polling found her in contention to win the primary. In a Q&A with the Council on Foreign Relations, she laid out her policies on issues not much discussed at campaign events, such as the fate of Venezuela's embattled president.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Pick your metaphor — the dam is breaking, or maybe the floodgates, or maybe the Rubicon is being crossed — but House Democrats have begun moving faster toward some form of impeachment, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The president's apparent effort to obtain damaging information on Joe Biden's son in a call with Ukraine's president has pushed dozens of “front-line” Democrats into the fray; in the past 48 hours, more Democrats who represent districts won by President Trump have endorsed impeachment than had endorsed it in the past nine months.

Republicans claim to be overjoyed. “They’re obsessed with impeaching President Trump and they don’t care if they have to throw away the House Majority to do it,” wrote Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the House GOP's super PAC, after a group of Trump-seat Democrats came out for impeachment proceedings.

Thirty-one House Democrats represent districts won by the president in 2016, but they're not all created equal.

Blue-trending districts. Ten House Democrats won 2018 races in areas where Donald Trump ran behind Mitt Romney, from the Detroit suburbs won by Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan to the Chicago exurbs won by Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. And some of these districts voted for the statewide Democratic tickets last year, suggesting that the Trump brand has continued to hurt local Republicans.

Trump-trending districts. Twenty-one Democrats represent districts that either edged a toward the president in 2016, some by a little (Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia's district went from a 2.3-point Mitt Romney win to 3.4-point Trump win), some by a lot (Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota's massive district backed Mitt Romney by 9.8 points, then Trump by 30.8 points). Twelve of them come from places that flipped from backing Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Trump four years later.

Democrats with/without real opponents. The filing deadline for 2020 races is months away; only Illinois and Texas require House candidates to file by the end of this year. But not every Democrat who flipped a House seat last year is facing a real challenge yet. Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania is facing a first-time challenger who has raised less than $20,000; Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan hasn't drawn a Republican opponent. On the other side of the equation are Democrats such as Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, whose chief opponent, Wesley Hunt, raised more than $500,000 in just a few months as a candidate; after Fletcher joined the impeachment call, Hunt accused her of endorsing a ""blatantly partisan impeachment investigation.”

Reviews from some quarters weren’t favorable:

In the instanalysis on Fox News, host Bret Baier said, “I don’t see eight times Joe Biden being mentioned. I count three, tangentially. So some of the earlier reporting may have been something different.” Fox News correspondent Catherine Herridge said, “There are not multiple references, as widely reported, to the former vice president and his son. Based on our count, there’s a key reference and then some follow-on references, so a handful, approximately three.” Later on, host Harris Faulkner referred directly to the Journal’s reporting: “It says that the look into Joe Biden was mentioned eight times, when in fact, the first time you hear Rudy Giuliani’s name on it is from the president of Ukraine and I can only find six instances of anybody’s name, north of a couple of times, and it was Giuliani.”

Also on Fox News, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) said, “I didn’t see Joe Biden’s name mentioned in there eight times.""

Well, the Wall Street Journal never made that representation. To repeat, it reported that Trump had urged Zelensky “about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump’s potential 2020 opponent.” So how does that claim compare with the “Memorandum of Telephone Conversation”?

As ABC News reports in a detailed breakdown of the document, there are eight distinct Trump requests for a favor/assistance with an investigation. Not all of them reference Giuliani by name, but the message is clear through repetition: Get with Rudy on this!

AD

A Wall Street Journal spokesman sent the Erik Wemple Blog this note: “The call record released today is not a word-by-word transcript, and while we do not know the totality of the conversation, this record clearly shows multiple references to Mr. Giuliani and a proposed investigation, which supports our earlier reporting.”

AD

Bolding added to highlight a key point. Fine print on the document reads, “A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.” There are ellipses in the document that could be swallowing relevant portions of the presidential conversation. They also could be swallowing meandering Trump gibberish that defies transcription, even description.

Whatever the case, the reporting of the Journal — and The Post, as well — was “basically on target,” concluded Fox News media correspondent Howard Kurtz.

AD

Correct. In his public comments regarding this scandal, Trump has complained about “fake news” and “corrupt reporting.” In a remarkable twist of events, however, Trump himself authorized the release of a “Memorandum of Telephone Conversation” that corroborated this “fake news.” Thanks for confirming, Mr. President.

Senate lawmakers are eager to take Facebook to task for its high-profile acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp at a big antitrust hearing today. But one of their key witnesses will warn them that heavyhanded regulation from Washington could have unintended consequences for tech startups -- and ultimately prevent them from becoming competitors to tech giants.

“It’s critical that policymakers understand that not all [mergers and acquisitions are] the same,” Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures, will tell lawmakers on a Senate Judiciary subcommittee today, according to her prepared testimony.

One of lawmakers' top concerns at this afternoon's hearing on ""acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors"" will be whether Facebook tried to prevent the rise of new competitors by buying them up. But Nakache will stress that, if Washington goes too far in scrutinizing deals, it could end up causing problems for smaller companies seeking funding so they can challenge existing leaders in the industry.

She plans to warn lawmakers against “the unintended consequence of dampening the creation of and investment in companies that seek to directly challenge incumbents.""

Nakache will be one of the first venture capitalists to publicly testify about competition on Capitol Hill since antitrust scrutiny increased this summer. Her comments reflect their delicate position. Startups stand to benefit if the tech giants they hope to compete with are distracted by Washington's antitrust inquiries or regulators impose more limitations on their business. But at the same time, small tech companies are still deeply intertwined with -- and reliant on -- existing larger platforms.

That tension is particularly acute when it comes to acquisitions, which are a very common way for venture capitalists and founders to get a return on their investment in a startup. The four companies under scrutiny in Washington -- Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon -- are some of the biggest acquirers of tech startups. Problems for them could mean problems for deals.

So far, the tech giants have continued to acquire smaller companies, as we wrote about in The Technology 202 this summer when Google bought Looker. Just yesterday, Facebook acquired the brain computing startup CTRL-labs.

“I am concerned,” said Scott Kupor, managing partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and author of the new book “Secrets of Sand Hill Road"" told me at the time of the Looker acquisition. “It's not a tomorrow problem, but if this goes on for five, ten years, it could have a meaningful impact.”

Yet lawmakers are growing fed up with the Wild West environment that has allowed Silicon Valley tech titans to amass so much power, and some think it's time for Washington to play a greater role on these issues. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told me in an email that today's hearing is important because recent mergers have raised serious competition issues.

“Big technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world,” said Klobuchar, who is also running for president. “These companies' practices can limit options for consumers, distort prices, and stifle innovation. With virtually no meaningful pushback from our government, these companies have reshaped the meaning of American privacy, the purchasing of goods and services, and the working of our elections and our democracy.”

She has previously called for antitrust laws to be modernized and for more resources for federal regulators to enforce existing laws.

Other witnesses at the hearing will include Bruce Hoffman, director of the Bureau of competition at the Federal Trade Commission, as well as American Antitrust Institute president Diana Moss and John Yun, director of economic education At The Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University.

BITS: Google scored a key victory as a European court ruled that the company does not have to apply the ""Right to be Forgotten"" rule globally, the BBC's Leo Kelion reports this morning. When it receives a request to remove information under the law, Google will only have to remove links from its search results in the European Union, not elsewhere.

""Currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,"" the European Court of Justice ruling said.

The decision comes after a French regulator ordered Google to globally remove search result listing pages about a person under the European law, which allows people to ask tech companies to remove damaging or false information about them online. Google created a geoblocking feature that censored the links in Europe, but ensured they were still available to people in other parts of the world. Google then challenged a 100,000 fine the French regulator levied against the company.

The case has broad implications as technology companies operate globally across borders, and regulators around the world increasingly consider regulations to rein in American tech giants. Google argued removing the links globally could set a precedent that authoritarian governments outsie of Europe could abuse when trying to hide human rights abuses.

NIBBLES: Political campaigns and advocacy groups are taking a page from marketers by partnering with social media influencers in hopes of getting an edge with digital natives, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Georgia Wells report. Presidential campaigns of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang are all hoping that the Internet-grown celebrities will be able to persuade potential voters more than impersonal television ads or mailers, Emily and Georgia report.

Candidates' approaches to influencers varies. Kamala Harris's campaign has offered event invitations and merchandise in exchange for promoting her campaign; Andrew Yang's campaign has employed a public relations firm to create memes for influencers to share.

The Republican National Committee, which is fielding only one candidate, has taken a much more aggressive approach, offering social media influencers social-media training at its headquarters, Georgia and Emily report. Trump's campaign has also advertised on multiple YouTube channels, a significant platform for his base.

These efforts are expected to increase as 2020 approaches. Curtis Hougland, founder of tech start-up Main Street One — which is working on micro-targeted campaigns in several states — tells the Journal.

BYTES: Facebook took down a page spreading conservative content called “I Love America” and eight associated pages yesterday after a media report publicized that the page was run by Ukrainians, my colleague Craig Timberg reports. The continued circulation of political content targeted at American audiences by foreign actors raises doubts about Facebook's ability to curb foreign influence on its platform before the 2020 elections.

The page was founded in 2017, but only recently moved into spreading conservative content to an audience of more than 1 million followers, according to journalist Judd Legum, who first flagged the page to Facebook.

UPDATE: 8 hours after https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ's report, Facebook has taken down the Ukrainian ""I Love America"" page & every other page identified in the piece

While Facebook originally told Legum that the page did not violate appear to violate its rules for coordinated inauthentic behavior, it determined the pages did violate the policy and removed them late yesterday. Facebook said it did not detect that the pages were tied to any nation-state actor, but its investigation is ongoing. The pages appeared to be ""financially motivated, Facebook's head of cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher said on Twitter, adding that ""it's also critical that we don’t assume every clickbait operation is [government operations.]""

The pages repurposed content connected with Russia's Internet Research Agency, which continues to surface on both Facebook and Instagram. Researchers including David Carroll have questioned why the company hasn't done more to prevent the content from continuing to circulate.

You’d think Facebook would have fingerprinted the RU IRA memes to automate their detection when recycled on new pages with huge audiences in the US but operated out of Ukraine. But no. @JuddLegum’s latest discovery is “troubling” leading up to 2020. https://t.co/A9HBQRvseA — David Carroll 🦅 (@profcarroll) September 23, 2019

-- Apple will manufacture its new Mac Pro in Texas after the Trump administration granted the company exemptions from tariffs on several key components manufactured in China, my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.

“We believe deeply in the power of American innovation,” Cook said in the statement. “That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the U. S, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with U.S. suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”

The exemptions mark a reversal on Trump's previous comments about Apple and tariffs. President Trump tweeted in July: “Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China.""

The Trump administration granted the company exemptions for 10 items last week, but many more core products, including the iPhone, will face steep tariffs by the end of the year unless the U.S. government strikes a new trade deal with China, Reed reports.

In a segment Monday night on The Story with Martha MacCallum, Knowles was discussing w… [+3940 chars]",These things tend to happen at Fox News.,2019-09-24,The Washington Post,Fox News apologizes for offensive remarks. Sometimes.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/24/fox-news-apologizes-offensive-remarks-sometimes/,"Fox News host Harris Faulkner — subbing in for MacCallum — appeared to have trouble determining whether calling climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, “mentally ill” was offensive. So she punted to radio host Christopher Hahn, who said, ""You’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child. Shame on you.”

Crosstalk then took over as the two antagonists did precisely what Fox News wanted them to do. “Now, relax, skinny boy,” Hahn said at one point. “Have some couth when you’re on television. Maybe on your podcast you get away and say whatever you want because nobody’s listening. You’re on national television. Be a grown-up when you’re talking about children.”

AD

AD

Fox News later sided with Hahn, calling the remarks “disgraceful” and issuing a full apology to Thunberg and its viewers. The full text of the apology provides critical information as to why Fox News chose this path. Here it is: “The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful — we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.”

Bolding inserted to highlight a critical consideration for Fox News, which is: This guy is not on our payroll. He’s just some fellow with the Daily Wire who agreed to appear on Fox News for a talk on climate change.

What happens when critical Fox News personnel make comments that are just as outrageous, if not more so? Well, scroll back to the time that network host Tucker Carlson said that immigrants make the United States “dirtier.” Activists rallied advertisers to bail on their “Tucker Carlson Tonight” spots, and Fox News grabbed the mantle of the First Amendment: ""It is a shame that left-wing advocacy groups, under the guise of being supposed ‘media watchdogs,’ weaponize social media against companies in an effort to stifle free speech,” it said.

AD

AD

In July, Carlson launched a nakedly racist attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Outrage ensued, though Carlson assured viewers that the network has “got our back.” The Fox News suits were similarly supportive after Media Matters for America in March presented old racist and homophobic remarks that Carlson had made on a radio show. In one of them, he called Iraqis ""semi-literate primitive monkeys.”

On the same night that Knowles called Thunberg “mentally ill,” prime-time host Laura Ingraham ran some video of Thunberg’s remarks on climate accountability and then quipped, “I can’t wait for Stephen King's sequel, ‘Children of the Climate.'"" That, of course, was a riff on the tale of a murder cult run by children. We asked Fox News if it might just have a statement regarding Ingraham’s quip. No response yet.

In October 2018, a Fox Business Network executive denounced some anti-Semitic remarks that a guest had made on Lou Dobbs’s show. Those remarks had aired right after the mass killing at a Pittsburgh synagogue. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight,” said the executive. And a while back a Fox Business guest claimed that torture had “worked” on John McCain; no longer would that guest, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, appear on the network.

Good. Also good are other instances in which the network has taken strong and public action against paid contributors. In March, it condemned host Jeanine Pirro for Islamophobic remarks regarding Omar: ""Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?” asked Pirro.

The skirmish illustrated how ill-equipped Democrats, busy battling one another in the fight for the nomination, are to compete with Trump’s online megaphone, which includes not just his own Twitter feed and that of the Republican National Committee’s leadership, but also a regiment of conservative talking heads and highly active Internet trolls who have closed ranks around the president.

The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump.

But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.

“This is the first big test of the 2020 race: Is the press, are Democrats, are Democratic activists, going to let that happen again?” said Jennifer Palmieri, who was the Clinton campaign’s director of communications.

AD

AD

She and other former Clinton aides have been watching with an apprehensive sense of deja vu as they see Trump solicit a foreign government’s help in attacking a political adversary.

“You need to be aggressive so people know what’s true and what’s not,” she said. “You can’t pick your fights. . . . It’s a terrible situation for a campaign to be in. But that’s life when you’re dealing with Donald Trump.”

Biden has been buffeted in recent weeks by a flood of claims on social media seeking to weaponize his debate misstatements and other verbal miscues. The attacks have come not just from the right, but from the left as well.

The assertion that Biden behaved corruptly when it came to Ukraine marked a significant escalation by Trump and his allies to elevate what are unsubstantiated claims into a dangerous threat to the 76-year-old’s candidacy.

AD

AD

Zac Petkanas, the director of rapid response for Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said Democrats may have miscalculated four years ago in ignoring conspiracy theories that sprouted on the fringes of the Internet. They quickly went mainstream, Clinton’s campaign realized.

“The false attacks really were effective at sowing doubt, not only within a right-wing sphere, which is what we originally thought, but within our own supporters,” Petkanas said.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.

AD

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

AD

Trump has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence as vice president, and the president appeared to confirm on Sunday that he raised the matter in a July phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Washington Post Fact Checker analyzed several of the claims from Trump and his allies in May and gave them three Pinocchios.

Trump took his attacks even further on Monday — without proof — after Biden told Trump to release the transcript of his calls with Ukraine.

AD

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right?” Trump said, as he was meeting with the Polish president at the United Nations. He added: “If that ever happened — if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair by right now.”

AD

While Clinton initially ignored escalating conspiracy theories, Biden’s campaign has mobilized its research team, attempting to find ways to combat false charges and return the focus to Trump. They point to polls repeatedly showing Biden defeating Trump and say he has rattled the incumbent president.

“In an outrageous and unprecedented act of corruption — and at the expense of our national security priorities — Donald Trump pressured a foreign country to smear the Democratic candidate he’s most afraid of facing next November,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman. “This kind of ‘self over country’ gutter politics is grossly beneath what we stand for as a country and will be aggressively fought against by the campaign. For the sake of our democracy, it is also incumbent on the press to finally internalize the lessons of 2016 and dispense with the uncritical repetition of wholesale lies simply because Donald Trump says them.”

Biden, at a fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday, said the president’s behavior was troubling. “The more he thinks he’s likely to lose, the more erratic he becomes and the more things he does that are worrisome,” Biden said.

AD

Over the weekend, the Biden campaign and Trump released dueling videos on Twitter that underscored the social media imbalance Democrats are fighting.

Trump’s video was viewed about 2.7 million times — nearly five times more than Biden’s video. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who was sentenced to prison last year for lying to the FBI, sent a tweet Friday night spreading another unfounded allegation against Biden — and it got more retweets than the video posted at the top of Biden’s official Twitter account.

AD

On Facebook, Trump’s supporters also mobilized, amplifying unfounded rumors about the vice president and his son. Conservative social media influencers Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as Diamond and Silk, weighed in on Friday evening, with their post gaining thousands of shares hours before Biden’s campaign had put out anything more than a plain statement on the platform addressing Trump’s phone call.

AD

Top results on Facebook included material from pro-Trump news pages, some of which are operated by users outside the United States. Many of these pages enjoy more than a million followers, who are treated to a battery of videos and links to articles from websites that run hyper-partisan articles, often without bylines.

The online battles illustrate how the campaign is increasingly unfolding in an unregulated digital ecosystem, one in which Trump has eschewed traditional political norms.

AD

Social media companies maintain that they are not arbiters of truth and intervene only when there is evidence of coordinated inauthentic activity — a position that has frustrated Democrats. Although Democrats generally have put faith in institutions — the Justice Department, the media and Congress — to check Trump’s stretching presidential power, they see few avenues of recourse against the Trump fusillade, even as House Democrats debate whether to begin impeachment proceedings.

AD

“Regardless of who our nominee is, I think we’re going to face similar unconventional actions by the president, and so this is something that should concern the DNC,” Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said Saturday as he trailed Biden into the grounds of the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines. “I don’t have a concrete idea off the top of my head.”

The party “ought to take every possible responsible action,” Coons said, adding that one option might be filing with the Federal Election Commission. But that would probably be futile, he admitted, because the body lacks a quorum.

Brian Fallon, the chief spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, said arguing with Trump on merits was hardly ever successful and said he believes the best option Democrats have is putting Trump on the daily defensive with impeachment proceedings.

“It’s just a nasty mess. You heard that about emails,” Fallon said. “In the end, people thought it was a mountain being made of a molehill. But then they’d invariably blame Hillary for setting up the server in the first place. They’d blame her a little bit even though they thought Trump was being unfair.”

Biden in June issued a promise not to use false or purloined information and called on other candidates to do the same. But the party has not acted on a resolution that would bind all its candidates to similar norms, even though the pledge was endorsed earlier this year by state party chairs.

Democratic lawmakers have been quick to condemn the president, but they strained to formulate a way for the party to respond collectively to Trump’s claims. From staunch Biden allies to rivals for the Democratic nomination, there wasn’t a clear sense of how to maneuver tactically to quiet Trump’s megaphone or come up with a counternarrative.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said the president’s alleged phone call was “just another on the list of issues” that warrant his impeachment.

When asked in an interview what other Democratic candidates could do to present a united front, she said, “I’m not going to tell other candidates what to do.”"

Trump isn’t even bothering to deny the basics. He confirmed Tuesday that he had held up delivery of a promised $391 million in military aid for the Ukrainians in mid-July, before his call to Zelensky. Trump claimed he wanted to pressure “Europe and other nations to contribute to Ukraine.” Trump had suggested Sunday that in the July call he had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son’s work for a Ukrainian gas company.

Forget the political jousting between Trump and Biden, and consider the Ukrainian soldier in the field fighting to save his country. He has a nightmare communications problem because he can’t talk reliably with his commanders. Russia has been hacking or jamming Ukrainian military communications since it seized Crimea and began supporting the separatists in 2014.

The United States wanted to help fix this battlefield communications disaster. One item in the $391 million package Congress appropriated is a secure system made by L3 Technologies, a unit of Harris Corp., that could allow the Ukrainians to maintain contact despite Russian interference. The L3 equipment was ready for delivery in July when the company was told no, there was a hold, the equipment couldn’t be shipped, according to a congressional source.

AD

AD

L3 and other companies supplying Ukraine contacted leading Republican members of Congress, such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) to find out why there was a delay. The members of Congress made inquiries and learned that the Office of Management and Budget had stopped the shipments, on orders of the White House, to conduct “due diligence” about corruption and the newly elected Zelensky, according to one knowledgeable source.

But Graham warned the White House: “You can’t send a signal that we’re going to back out of the deal,” the source said, adding, “It’s one thing to do ‘due diligence’ and another that we’re changing our posture.” These national security arguments eventually prevailed, and the Ukraine assistance was finally released on Sept. 11.

Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are. One legislator who worried about the holdup of L3’s communications package was Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), a former Air Force officer who represents a state where L3 has some of its plants.

AD

AD

Houlahan told me Monday: “I’m alarmed about reports that the provision of military equipment — which Ukraine needs, which Congress supported — was stopped, inexplicably, and then started up again, inexplicably. . . . Ukraine, an ally of ours, is under stress fighting Russian proxies. The idea that this happened with very little reasonable explanation is worrisome.” An L3 spokesperson declined to comment.

People who regard this latest Trump affair as just more political noise should examine an op-ed published online Monday by seven freshman Democrats who served in Iraq, Afghanistan or other military deployments. These aren’t reflexive Trump bashers. They’re mostly from swing districts where impeachment isn’t very popular, but the Ukraine case pushed them to recommend that radical step.

Here’s what Houlahan and the six other national-security veterans wrote in The Post: Trump “allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain.”

The former military and intelligence officers saw Trump’s actions as a potential violation of his oath of office, requiring urgent investigation, and they’re right. This isn’t just another partisan fight. It goes to the essential obligations of a commander in chief.

They explained that the president had “concerns” and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.

Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an “interagency process” but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11.

Trump’s order to withhold aid to Ukraine a week before his July 25 call with Volodymyr Zelensky is likely to raise questions about the motivation for his decision and fuel suspicions on Capitol Hill that Trump sought to leverage congressionally approved aid to damage a political rival. The revelation comes as lawmakers clash with the White House over a related whistleblower complaint made by an intelligence official alarmed by Trump’s actions — and as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is said to be exploring whether it’s time to allow impeachment proceedings.

Republican senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee said Sept. 12 that the aid to Ukraine had been held up while the Trump administration explored whether Zelensky, the country’s new president, was pro-Russian or pro-Western. They said the White House decided to release the aid after Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) threatened to freeze $5 billion in Pentagon funding for next year unless the money for 2019 was distributed.

One senior administration official said Monday that Trump’s decision to hold back the funds was based on his concerns about there being “a lot of corruption in Ukraine” and that the determination to release the money was motivated by the fiscal year’s looming close on Sept. 30.

AD

AD

There was concern within the administration that if they did not spend the money, they would run afoul of the law, this official said, noting that, eventually, Trump gave the OMB’s acting director, Russell Vought, permission to release the money. The official emphatically denied that there was any link between blocking the aid and pressing Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, stating: “It had nothing to do with a quid pro quo.”

But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were calling for an investigation of what they viewed as potential “extortion,” as Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking Democrat, put it Monday. Trump, he said, is trying to “reshape American foreign policy” to advance his personal and political goals.

“I don’t think it really matters . . . whether the president explicitly told the Ukrainians that they wouldn’t get their security aid if they didn’t interfere in the 2020 elections,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “There is an implicit threat in every demand that a United States president makes of a foreign power. . . . That foreign country knows that if they don’t do it, there are likely to be consequences.”

AD

AD

Trump on Monday repeated his denial of doing anything improper and insisted that his July 25 conversation with Zelensky was “a perfect phone call.” He also hinted that he may release a transcript of it.

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley rejected claims that Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo. “But because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president,” Gidley said.

Zelensky’s “entire” administration was concerned “that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens,” Murphy said, citing his interactions with numerous Ukrainian officials during an early September trip there. Murphy said he heard “directly” from Zelensky about “his concern about why the aid was being cut off to Ukraine,” though the Ukraine’s new president did not specifically broach the subject of a quid pro quo.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases — at one point, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Trump’s allies have frequently said he has been better about distributing military aid, and specifically lethal aid, to Ukraine than his predecessor. Yet according to Democratic and Republican aides, no administration has withheld funds as long and as mysteriously as the Trump administration did this year since the United States began helping Ukraine fend off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern provinces.

Congressional officials were notified twice this year, on Feb. 28 and again on May 23, that the administration intended to release large tranches of military aid to Ukraine. Congress approved two large pots of military aid for Ukraine during fiscal 2019: $250 million, to be managed by the Pentagon, for equipment such as sniper rifles, counter-artillery radar systems, ammunition and grenade launchers; and $141 million, to be funneled through the State Department, for maritime security, NATO interoperability and various initiatives to help Ukraine’s military fend off Russian aggression.

AD

AD

Despite those notifications, the money was not transmitted until this month.

According to administration officials, discussions about Ukrainian aid began in June. Withholding aid from foreign governments is something the president has frequently requested, such as with Central American countries when he said they were not doing their part to help the United States with immigrants amassing at the southern border.

Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted to release the money to Ukraine because he thought it would help the country while curtailing Russian aggression. But Trump has said he was primarily concerned with corruption.

“It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Trump told reporters. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

AD

AD

Besides Bolton, several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.

The decision was communicated to State and Defense officials on July 18, officials familiar with the meeting said.

By mid-August, lawmakers were acutely aware that the OMB had assumed all decision-making authority from the Defense and State departments and was delaying the distribution of the aid through a series of short-term notices. Several congressional officials questioned whether the OMB had the legal authority to direct federal agencies not to spend money that Congress had already authorized, aides said.

AD

Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the State Department declined to comment.

Mid-August is also when a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint regarding Trump and Ukraine to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the complaint’s existence Sept. 9 — the same day three House committees launched an investigation to determine whether Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W.

Capitol Hill has not been briefed on the details of the whistleblower complaint, on orders of the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who after consulting with the Justice Department and the White House declined to transmit the complaint to lawmakers. On Thursday, Maguire is set to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee and in a closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Correction: This story was updated to clarify that, during his visit to Ukraine earlier this month, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) learned of concerns from several officials in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration that U.S. aid was being withheld because of the Ukrainian government’s unwillingness to investigate the Bidens. Zelensky, however, did not specifically draw a connection to the Bidens when he met with Murphy."

On The Hill

THE POINT OF NO RETURN: Pressure is mounting on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open the formal impeachment inquiry she has so long resisted.

And then there were 146: On Monday night, seven House Democrats with national security and military backgrounds who won competitive House districts in 2018 came out to back launching an impeachment inquiry — bringing the total count of Democrats in favor of opening an inquiry to 146.

In an op-ed in The Post, freshman Democratic Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia write:

“If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

They are referring to allegations Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Joe Biden and his son. Trump did so while the United States was withholding promised aid from Ukraine.

House Dem just now: “the dam is breaking” on impeachment. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

More than a majority: Pelosi, who has said impeaching Trump is “just not worth it,” is now “sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach President Trump,” multiple Democratic officials told my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis.

“Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has asked colleagues whether they believe that Trump’s own admission that he pressured a Ukrainian leader to investigate a political foe is a tipping point,” Rachael and Mike report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night to gauge support in the caucus, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable.”

From a Pelosi ally: Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a close Pelosi ally, also has changed her tune, writing in a statement that an impeachment inquiry “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable.

“Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she tweeted.

On today's docket: Pelosi has summoned House leaders to a 4 p.m. meeting to discuss the matter.

“Mindful that Democrats may have only a brief window to decide their course, [Pelosi] summoned the leaders of six House committees involved in investigations of the president to meet on Tuesday, telling the lawmakers to come without aides. Afterward, she planned to convene a special meeting of the Democratic caucus to discuss impeachment,” the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, Nick Fandos, Michael Crowley and Ken Vogel report. A full meeting of the Democratic caucus will take place afterward.

Rachael and Mike report that House leadership has discussed “the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence” to handle a hypothetical impeachment inquiry.

In the meantime though, Pelosi still faces some political obstacles:

“Voters still overwhelming disapprove of Democrats impeaching the president — though those polls where conducted before last week’s reports about the whistleblower complaint. In the Senate, Republicans have made it clear that they are standing with Trump and are unlikely to convict him if a trial occurs,” per Rachael and Mike.

But Trump seems impervious to the growing political firestorm — indeed, he appeared to be stoking it yesterday with incendiary comments targeting Biden at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.

“What he’s learned is you can get away with just about anything if you’re willing to gamble and you have zero shame,” Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, told the New York Times's Peter Baker. “He had just outbluffed the old-school way of holding people to account, so what the heck, why not go for it in the phone call to the new, young and vulnerable Ukrainian president?”

“It’s difficult to imagine a purer example, even on the president’s own account of his conduct, of why the Constitution’s framers thought it essential to include the impeachment power,” Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told Baker.

At The White House

THE FACTS ARE COMING OUT: As the White House refuses to release the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky, reporters unearthed important details fueling suspicions Trump may have sought to leverage and withhold congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.

The latest: “President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials,” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig.

“Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had 'concerns' and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.”

Key: “Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an 'interagency process' but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,” per Karoun, Josh, Ellen and Carol.

'A perfect phone call': That's how Trump has described the July phoner with Ukraine's president. But Zelensky spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) during an early September visit to Ukraine and “'directly' expressed concerns at their meeting that 'the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence' of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens,” per our colleagues.

Trump took his attacks on Biden and the press to a whole new level:

“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump told reporters on Monday from a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.

The Campaign

DNC RAISES DEBATE THRESHOLDS: “The Democratic National Committee announced new qualification rules for the November debates,” our colleague Michael Scherer writes of the decision “that could kick more candidates off the stage, as party leaders continue to push to shrink the field in the presidential nomination fight.”

The new rules: "" … candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada,” Scherer reports.

Who is in trouble: Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Rep. John Delaney (Md.) have yet to qualify for the October debate. They've so far failed to rank in a single qualifying poll.

Shades of McCain: ""Pete Buttigieg was inside his campaign bus, with reporters an arm's length away all looking directly at him, their notebooks, pens and recorders in hand,"" the Des Moines Register's Barbara Rodriguez reports. Bus tours across Iowa are quite common, but in a modern day twist on the late Sen. John McCain's ""Straight Talk Express,"" Buttigieg's team welcomed reporters to join him for the entirety of his four-day trip, everything on-the-record.

Some of the questions he's answered so far: ""What does he think about growing calls for an impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump?"" Rodriguez writes. ""Did he have a comment on the Republican Party's talking points about the presidential race? How does he assess the current psyche of American voters? What does he miss about home? How many of his signature white shirts and jeans had he packed for his four-day bus tour across Iowa? And was he ironing"" (4 shirts, he ironed himself; one pair of jeans).

In the Media

THIS BOMBSHELL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER: A.G. Sulzberger, the Times publisher, spoke at Brown University about the state of journalism. He discussed for the first time a story that shows how much the Trump administration “has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press.” It is simply jaw-dropping.

You can read the full-text of his speech here.

What happened: “Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh,” Sulzberger said. “Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.”

Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.” But this time was different: “We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said.

The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said. Luckily, they figured out another way: “Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help,” Sulzberger said. “Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.”

We apologize for the delay.

THE BIG IDEA: If President Trump thought releasing the readout of his call with Ukraine’s president would break impeachment fever on Capitol Hill, he miscalculated.

The five-page summary released this morning intensified Democratic demands to see the entire whistleblower complaint. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said, according to the transcript, after asking for ""a favor."" (Here are seven additional takeaways, via Aaron Blake.)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged fellow party leaders in a private meeting to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, per Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade.

Several Senate Republicans were stunned and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released the rough transcript, Robert Costa reports. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters after reading the transcript.

-- “Senior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred the concerns about the call to the Justice Department, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. The inspector general later also referred the matter to the FBI,” Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report. “Career prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department’s criminal division then reviewed the transcript of the call, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts ‘could not make out and cannot make out’ the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered ‘a thing of value’ under the law.”

-- What was released by the White House is a five-page summary of a 30-minute conversation. That means some of what was covered is likely not even in the memo. The document includes a disclaimer on the first page that it is “not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”

“The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,” it says. “A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.”

-- Richard Nixon released a transcript, too. After the revelation that he recorded Oval Office meetings, the then-president refused to turn over the tapes, claiming executive privilege, and fought subpoenas in court. Eventually, trying to quell a political firestorm, he offered transcripts – which he personally edited – and insisted they exonerated him. “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said in April 1974. Months later, when House investigators listened to some of the audio, it turned out there were significant discrepancies and key phrases missing. Ever since Nixon resigned, the White House has, perhaps understandably, generally avoided recording presidential phone calls. That tradition explains why there’s apparently no recording on the American side of Trump’s July conversation.

-- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill made clear even before the summary came out that the summary will not be enough to deter them from moving ahead with the impeachment inquiry. They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power. “There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,” Pelosi said during a live event for the Atlantic. “You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. … I don't think there's a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown and is entitled to legal protections, wants to speak to members of his committee and has formally sought guidance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about how he could do so. “We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted. Lawyers for the whistleblower confirmed this.

-- The Senate passed a resolution last night, by unanimous consent and with no Republican objections, calling for the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required by law. The House plans to vote later today on a resolution condemning the administration’s refusal to provide the complaint. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to sit down with the Ukrainian president later today at the U.N. General Assembly. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify in open session tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee and then in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

-- Pelosi personally informed Trump of her decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in a Tuesday morning phone call. “The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings,” per Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. “The conversation, however, quickly turned to the president’s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions … Trump told Pelosi that he wasn’t the one blocking the complaint. … She responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint.”

-- The New York Times reports that White House and intelligence officials are trying to hash out a plan to release a redacted version of the whistleblower report in a bid to quell calls for impeachment and sow Democratic divisions on the best path forward: “People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report. “The appearance that they were stonewalling Congress, in their view, could prove more damaging than the whistle-blower’s account. Mr. Trump also believes that the allegations about him are not nearly as damning as they have been portrayed and that disclosing them will undercut the impeachment drive, people close to the president said.”

-- A senior administration official told Politico that the White House is “preparing” to give Congress both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report by the end of this week. “The administration official stressed the decision and timing could change over the next few days,” Nancy Cook reports. “The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.”

-- Even though the whistleblower complaint focused on the Trump call with Zelensky, officials familiar with its contents say that it includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. “Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official said. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.” That anonymous quote comes from a story that posted last night by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima.

“Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists … to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev,” they report. “The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain. As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with [Zelensky] out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race …

“U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower … One official — speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity — described the climate as verging on ‘bloodletting.’ … Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. … Trump’s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing. Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Giuliani and Trump …

“Then-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression … But by then his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani’s agenda or authority … Giuliani told The Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward. ‘We had the same visibility as anybody else — watching Giuliani on television,’ a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative.”

-- Giuliani had an outburst on Fox News last night when a fellow panelist was talking over him. “Shut up, moron,” Giuliani shouted on “The Ingraham Angle,” yelling at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn. “Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” (Allyson Chiu)

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS REMAIN OVER IMPEACHMENT:

-- Pelosi’s declaration left unsettled key questions about how that investigation will unfold. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore some of them: “How sweeping will the probe be? How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi’s unilateral pronouncement — which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote — do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance? … The lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe — and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted. …

“[T]he House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s fervently pro-impeachment chairman. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special ‘select’ committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines. … The past two presidential impeachment processes, involving [Nixon] and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now … That is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. …

“Meanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered — one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry … and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by [Mueller], episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic ‘frontliners’ in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. … ‘This should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,’ said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step.

“But Pelosi’s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump’s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump’s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment. ‘I see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,’ said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump’s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry.”

-- Our latest whip count: 198 House Democrats now publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry. That includes 22 of the 24 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifty-seven Democrats endorsed proceedings in a period of 24 hours:

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democrats have crossed the Rubicon, and nobody really knows where it will lead. “I can’t tell you what will come from this. I don’t think anybody can,” said Dan Sena, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “But it is definitely going to be an X-factor going into the 2020 election.” Michael Scherer talked to several other political professionals:

Democratic strategists hope the fact pattern behind Trump’s communications with Ukraine is far more direct and damning than the complex stories of potential obstruction contained in Bob Mueller's report: “This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened.""

“This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened."" GOP strategists hope impeachment would gin up their voters in 2020: “There is nothing that will do more for Republican turnout than this. And the last couple of presidential elections have all been turnout elections,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster working on the Trump reelection effort.

-- A Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from this past Thursday through Monday found that 57 percent of voters believe Trump should not be impeached. John Wagner reports: “Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”

-- This explains why many moderate Democrats still remain cautious. For example, Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) – who picked up a Republican seat in the Kansas City suburbs last year – expressed support for Pelosi’s pronouncement last night but carefully avoided using the word “impeachment” in her statement. (K.C. Star)

-- Biden is mostly alone in the Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry. Speaking in Delaware, the former vice president called on Congress to begin proceedings if the White House continues stalling lawmakers' investigations. ""Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings,"" Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve Wootson Jr. report:

Bernie Sanders would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment come before the Senate, saying he wants to review evidence before making a decision. He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa.

-- The impeachment debate will effectively freeze the 2020 campaign, predicts ABC News political director Rick Klein: “It would all play out against an inconvenient political timeline, with hearings in the House and a potential trial in the Senate almost certainly extending well into the winter. That's the precise time that campaigning is most intense, with primary voting beginning in February. For the six senators and two sitting House members running for president, that could make for far more time spent at the day job in Washington than anticipated. Long-developed plans for policy rollouts and potential breakout moments could wind up subsumed by the news.""

-- The Trump reelection campaign immediately tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “Emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi­tal­ize on Trump’s army of online donors. ‘The Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,’ read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. ‘President Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.’ … The appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an ‘Official Impeachment Defense Task Force’ made up of ‘only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters,’ with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.”

-- In public, Trumpworld is making the impeachment inquiry look like white noise. But in private, White House aides and allies are starting to feel anxious. Politico reports: “Few in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump’s call … ‘The president’s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,’ said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. … The White House is betting Trump can ride out this ‘outrage du jour,’ as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the … dozens of other threats to his presidency. … But current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego — and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.”

-- The world is reacting warily to the specter of impeachment. Rick Noack and David Crawshaw report: Some experts said it “would have little effect on hot-button issues such as the trade dispute with China or his promises on Brexit, while others predicted that increased domestic pressure would force Trump to seek a quick foreign-policy breakthrough… The developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.”

COMMENTARY:

-- “I’m a Republican. Let’s force the question of impeachment with the GOP,” writes veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy: “In the wake of the president’s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump’s fitness for office. This test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?”

-- “This isn’t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain,” writes columnist David Ignatius: “Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country. … Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are.”

-- “If we legitimize Trump’s behavior, it will be open season on our politics,” writes columnist Robert Kagan: “Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents … Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.”

-- “Republicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump’s standard as proper for future presidents,” writes columnist Dana Milbank.

-- Conservative columnist Max Boot identifies seven reasons why he thinks Trump should be impeached:

He obstructed the administration of justice.

He failed to defend America from foreign election interference.

He attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents.

He failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress.

He conspired with Michael Cohen to conceal alleged extramarital relationships.

He misused his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall.

He retains ownership of a global business empire, which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

-- But Biden sill could wind up being the principal casualty, Pat Buchanan writes, hopefully, in the New Hampshire Union Leader: “Calls are rising for Biden’s son to be called to testify before congressional committees. ... The charges and the countercharges will become what the campaign is all about.""

-- Democrats are upholding a double standard on Ukraine, chimes in conservative columnist Marc Thiessen.

-- Impeaching Trump could hurt the institution of the presidency, worries John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration: “If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.”

-- We should talk about how Ukrainians feel about this, says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, in the Times: “Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign. Ukraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump’s desire to be re-elected at any price.”

-- The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board calls this the Impeachment Congress: “Mr. Trump’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, if that’s what it was, showed bad judgment in our view … But bad judgment is not a crime, and voters may demand more to annul an election only months before they have a chance to render their own judgment about Mr. Trump’s behavior.""

-- Pelosi’s patience on impeachment has paid off, so far, CNN’s Michael Warren writes: “Democrats have now created the appearance that impeachment of Trump is a last resort, not a first resort. She divorced the process from the mess of the Mueller findings. And she allowed those moderate freshmen who built her majority, rather than the divisive members on the left, to lead on the issue.”

-- “Pelosi has to hope for the worst case for Trump,"" writes National Review executive editor Rich Lowry, ""because it’s going to be difficult to climb down from impeachment now.""

-- Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume believes Pelosi has handled this cleverly: “It strikes me that the Speaker and the other leaders are under pressure from the left wing of the party and the leftists in their caucus -- who are numerous -- to move ahead here … I think [she’s] thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it.”

Bijan Rafiekian leaves a court hearing last year in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A judge overturned a jury's verdict convicting Michael Flynn’s former business partner of illegally lobbying for Turkey, saying the evidence against him was “insufficient.” Rachel Weiner reports: “'The verdict was against the heavy weight of the evidence,’ Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in a 39-page opinion tossing Bijan Rafiekian’s convictions. The decision is another blow to efforts by the Justice Department to crack down on unregistered lobbying for foreign governments. … Trenga pointed to the fact that Flynn was not charged or implicated by prosecutors until the eve of trial as ‘particularly telling.’”

-- Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic power broker, and Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman, said they were notified on Monday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had closed the inquiry into work they did that benefited Ukrainian interests. It’s another reflection of the challenges facing prosecutors attempting to more aggressively pursue possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, Tom Hamburger and Matt Zapotosky report: “The decision to drop the investigation came weeks after a federal jury in Washington found former White House counsel Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about his media contacts related to his work for the Ukrainian government. …

""Weber and Podesta were among several lobbyists and lawyers that (Paul) Manafort helped bring aboard as part of an effort to improve the image of the Ukrainian government between 2012 and 2014, according to Mueller’s report. Mueller ultimately referred the case involving the two men to federal prosecutors in New York. ... As the investigation proceeded, Podesta closed his iconic lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, in the fall of 2017. Weber left Mercury, a firm he had helped lead since 2011, in August.”

-- A federal judge rejected former Trump confidant Roger Stone’s request to suppress all evidence gathered through 18 search warrants at his November trial. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Attorneys for Stone had argued that prosecutors illegally relied on unproven assumptions about Russia’s involvement and sought to force them to prove in court the role of Russian operatives in hacks on the Democratic National Committee and [Clinton’s] presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had ‘not come close’ to showing the government misled the magistrates or judges who approved the warrants, that federal agents knowingly or intentionally lied to them or that the warrants were premised on Russia’s role in the hacking.”

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- A new Trump administration proposal to limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps could end free school lunches for about 500,000 American children. Moriah Balingit reports: “The change, proposed over the summer, would cut an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets. But the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.”

-- NASA is trying to land on the moon, and its biggest obstacle might be Congress. Christian Davenport reports: NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is seeking “votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades — the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era. … Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA — as they do lowering crime or boosting national security — getting them to increase the agency’s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.”

-- The administration has granted few waivers to visitors blocked from entering the U.S. by the travel ban Trump imposed days after taking office, with officers arguing that people from five predominantly Muslim countries continue to pose a national security threat. Abigail Haulsohner reports: “Since the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a ‘Muslim ban,’ the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants — 7,679 — have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.”

-- The chief executive of Juul Labs is stepping down amid outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping. From the Times: “The executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Croswaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, the San-Francisco-based company. Juul also said it would end one of its campaigns, ‘Make the Switch,’ which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The company also said it would not fight the Trump administration’s proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.”

-- Massachusetts will place a four-month ban on all sales of vaping products, the toughest state crackdown on e-cigarettes so far. Hannah Knowles reports: “Bans on sales of flavored vaping products took effect this month in New York and Michigan, and the Trump administration said it plans to enact a similar regulation at the federal level. Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine. But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that’s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

-- California health officials called on everyone to stop vaping immediately, per the Los Angeles Times: “‘We are seeing something that we have not seen before,’ said Dr. Charity Dean, California’s acting public health officer, in a statement. ‘There are numerous unknown factors at this time, and due to the uncertainty of the exact cause, it is our recommendation that consumers refrain from vaping until the investigation has concluded.’”

-- House Republicans are seriously considering relaxing term limits for committee chairmen. From Politico: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP’s long-standing rule that allows members to be the top Republican on a committee for only three terms, regardless of whether they serve in the majority or minority. One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker’s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- A new United Nations climate report finds that massive change is already here for the world’s oceans and frozen regions. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Wednesday’s report on the world’s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects only foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked. Given current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Extreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century — around 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries. … More than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report...""

-- A glacier on Mont Blanc could collapse. From the BBC: “About 250,000 cubic metres of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak ... The mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur said global warming was changing the mountain. … The glacier, in the Glarus Alps, has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its original size. Scientists say it has lost at least 80% of its volume just since 2006, a trend accelerated by rising global temperatures.”

-- The Trump administration declared there’s no “international right to abortion” during the U.N. General Assembly, calling on other countries to join a coalition pushing the elimination of what it calls “ambiguous” terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health, from U.N. documents. Ariana Eunjung Cha reports: “Earlier this year, HHS officials began meeting with representatives from other countries, urging them to join a new international coalition that would focus on the value of the family, and which would not condone harmful sexual risks for young people, or promote abortion as a means of family planning.

“Other countries, civil society and women’s rights groups have expressed alarm at the efforts and accused the United States of aligning with countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan with poor human rights records and, also, of putting unfair pressure on poor countries that depend on U.S. aid.""

-- Trump condemned globalism during his address to the General Assembly. Anne Gearan and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump read his address in a somber monotone, rarely punctuating words or pausing for emphasis, but his message for the 74th session of the annual gathering of world leaders was clear as he argued that a view of the world as a global commons had ‘exerted a religious pull over past leaders’ at the expense of their own nations. … In his 37-minute address, Trump stressed that all nations must take care of themselves first while adding that the United States would get involved abroad only when its own interests were threatened. He also used his platform Tuesday to take a hard line against Iran...""

-- Trump also heaped praise on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi during UNGA. At home, Sissi faces mass protests to step down from human rights activists. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside. ‘Demonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,’ he told reporters ... ‘Egypt has a great leader. He’s highly respected; he’s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I’m not worried about that.’ … Trump and Sissi’s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt. People took to the streets in Cairo and elsewhere Friday, chanting, ‘Rise up, fear not, Sissi must go.’ The protests were relatively small but significant because such concerted public displays against Sissi are rare.”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the Amazon isn’t on fire, rejecting calls for foreign intervention. Marina Lopes reports: “The Amazon isn’t in flames, he told [UNGA] in New York, but brimming with riches. And Brazil will decide how to develop it. ‘We are open to explore our potential in a sustainable way, through partnerships that add value,’ Bolsonaro said. It was his first address on the world stage since the worst fires in a decade hit the Amazon this year. In a speech peppered with references to God, socialism and patriotism, he said foreign powers with an eye on Brazil’s natural riches ‘have an interest in keeping indigenous people living like cave men.’”

-- Venezuela’s ex-intelligence chief said he told President Nicolás Maduro about Colombian guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Anthony Faiola reports: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figueroa said he hand-delivered reports including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil. “‘They never took action,’ he said. ‘You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.’ Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. … The classified report ... offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating. “

-- Hong Kong police are waging a war on facts as protests on the island continue. David Crawshaw and Timothy McLaughlin report: “The ‘yellow object’ lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts. As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. … With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city’s institutions and Hong Kong’s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law. Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate. Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ‘officer kicking a yellow object,’ not a man lying on the ground.”

For a minute there, it looked like Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 campaign would burst into flames five feet above its launchpad. The senator began her presidential bid by attempting to nullify one of her conspicuous liabilities — only to amplify that liability, amuse conservatives, and alienate indigenous groups. Within months, her finance director had quit, and her top left-wing rival had out fundraised her by an order of magnitude. Then, Joe Biden made his candidacy official, and promptly opened up a 30-point lead over the Massachusetts senator.

Nevertheless, she persisted. And with a little over four months before Iowa gets caucusing, Warren’s prospects have radically changed. As of this writing, betting markets now consider her by far the most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination. For months now, each wave of new polling has shown her star steadily rising both nationally and in early primary states. And the latest batch of surveys is no exception.

A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds Warren’s support nationally climbing from 19 percent in August to 27 percent today — a large enough gain to put her ahead of Biden in that survey for the first time ever. Meanwhile, a new UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll of the California primary suggests Warren has gained 11 points in the Golden State since June, giving her a commanding lead over the rest of the field. Meanwhile, the most recent data from the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire comport with this general trend.

But the best news for Warren in these polls may lay beneath the headline data. Here are five quick takeaways from the last week of polling that bode well for Warren’s odds of facing Trump next November:

1) Biden is bending, and just might break.

If you only looked at the national polling averages, Uncle Joe would appear to be in very solid shape. RealClearPolitics’s poll of polls has Biden boasting 29 percent support, which is just a tiny shade beneath where he’s typically been over the past three months; in other words, the national data shows no steep or uniform decline in Biden’s standing.

But in the early voting states — where each campaign’s resources have been concentrated — the picture looks much dimmer for the former vice-president. At the start of July, Biden’s average support in Iowa was 26 percent; today, it’s just 20. Warren now leads the field in the Hawkeye State by nearly three points in RCP’s polling average. And surveys from New Hampshire tell a similar story: As of mid-July, Biden was leading Warren there by an average of 22 points; now, he leads by an average of three. And Monmouth University poll released this week has Warren ahead of him by two.

Meanwhile, the national landscape may be in the process of converging on Iowa and New Hampshire’s: In Quinnipiac’s newly released national poll, Biden’s support is 7 percent lower than it was in the same survey one month ago. Other pollsters have documented declines in the percentage of Biden supporters who are “enthusiastic” about their candidate. Finally, there are some non-empirical reasons to think the former vice president’s standing will continue to erode. Thus far, Biden has benefited from the perception that he would be a uniquely “electable” nominee. But the increasingly conspicuous decline in his verbal skills — combined with the fact that the Democrats’ newly launched impeachment push is sure to call attention to his son Hunter’s influence-peddling (and Trump’s ostensibly, wildly false allegation that Biden corruptly intervened to fire a Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into Hunter’s company) — could erode Biden’s claim to being the Democrats’ “safe” option.

2) Warren’s base of support appears to be diversifying.

For most of the campaign, one of Warren’s apparent weaknesses was her coalition’s demographic homogeneity: She commanded the adoration of college-educated whites, but piddling levels of support among most other parts of the Democratic coalition.

This fact lent itself to two competing interpretations:

1) Something about Warren’s persona or program made her a niche candidate, who was already near her ceiling of support (there being only so many white professionals in blue America) and would thus fade away.

or

2) College-educated whites were more likely than other Democrats to be paying close attention to the primary race. Thus, Warren’s poor showing with nonwhite, and non-college-educated voters merely reflected the fact that her name was not as widely recognized as Joe Biden’s or Bernie Sanders’s. And if this were the case, then her strong support among college-educated whites might actually be a leading indicator of her appeal to the broader Democratic coalition: Once other groups began tuning in to this year’s race, they too would see the same things that had made “Patagonia Democrats” swoon.

While there may be an element of truth to No. 1 (Warren does appear to be especially appealing to Democrats who share her skin tone and academic pedigree), recent polling data has made the second look increasingly plausible. Quinnipiac’s new national poll show’s Warren’s coalition diversifying in both racial and class terms. In fact, the Q-poll has Warren beating Biden among white voters without a college degree by a remarkable 37 to 20 percent margin.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

New Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Warren making inroads among black voters:



July:

Biden 53%

Warren 4%



August:

Biden 47%

Warren 8%



Now:

Biden 40%

Warren 19% — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 25, 2019

The Los Angeles Times poll of California tells a similar story. After performing poorly with non-college whites in the same poll back in June, Warren now claims 29 percent of the demographic’s vote, while Sanders and Biden respectively boast 20 and 18 percent. And although Biden still leads the field with 40 percent support among African-American voters, Warren now has 24 percent support among that key demographic in California, putting her in second with that constituency.

But there’s even more direct evidence that Warren’s real base isn’t college-educated white voters, so much as it is voters who are paying attention: In the progressive think-tank Data For Progress’s polling of the 2020 primary, Warren consistently performs best among voters express a high level of interest in the news — including non-college-educated and non-white news junkies.

3) Harris 2020 (almost certainly) isn’t happening.

For a brief period in early July, Kamala Harris led both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in national polls. The California senator also boasted considerable support among professional Democrats and liberal donors. Many observers expected her to emerge as Biden’s main rival. But she’s proven to be the 2020 version of Scott Walker — a candidate with strong Establishment support who makes a lot of sense on paper, but never made much headway with actual voters. Quinnipiac now pegs Harris’s support at a mere 3 percent; her average in national polls is 5 percent. Critically, her numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost identical to her national figures. Unless she orchestrates an improbable comeback in one of those early states, Harris could be forced to euthanize her campaign by early March, leaving Warren the only viable option for Democrats who wish to elect a female president.

4) Warren is acceptable to a broader range of Democratic voters than any of her rivals.

Both the Quinnipiac national poll, and Los Angeles Times California survey, show Warren with a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than Biden or Sanders. And the Times finds that nearly 70 percent of California Democrats rank Warren as their first or second choice. Those results are consistent with a Data For Progress/Civiqs national poll released earlier this month, which showed Warren as the most popular second choice among Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris voters. And several other surveys have produced similar findings. This obviously bodes well for Warren if and when the Democratic field narrows, and suggests that a contested convention, she may have a strong claim to being a “unity” figure.

5) Sanders is stagnating.

Bernie Sanders’s campaign is very much alive. The Vermont senator’s has amassed enviable donor and volunteer networks, and has led in multiple recent polls of early primary states. Still, Sanders’s support has been stagnant nationally for months now, while his average share of the vote in Iowa has fallen from 19 percent in July to 12 percent today. Given that the senator is already well-known among Democratic primary voters, it is not clear how much room he has to grow. Sanders has made no secret of the fact that he favors Warren over his other primary rivals. So, it is at least possible to imagine a scenario in which Sanders’s campaign runs out of steam by next April, and then throws its considerable resources behind Warren.

Of course, Warren’s nomination remains far from a sure thing. Biden’s numbers are still formidable. Sanders is still within striking distance. And it’s still early. But at this point, there’s a strong case that Warren is the candidate you’d want to be."

We now have the readout of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and, as damning as it is, we still await the whistleblower complaint that put us on the road to impeachment, which Trump administration is withholding from Congress.

Which brings us to one William P. Barr, the attorney general of the United States and someone who has proven that there are almost no lengths he will not go to in order to protect President Trump.

AD

AD

What we have learned so far raises the possibility — even if at the moment nothing has been proven and we have more questions than answers — that Barr could be involved in the president’s wrongdoing, an attempt to cover up that wrongdoing, or both.

First, note that in his phone call with Zelensky, Trump repeatedly said that he wanted Barr involved in the effort to dig up dirt to use against Joe Biden.

First, Trump brought up CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company that helped investigate the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, in an apparent reference to some ludicrous right-wing conspiracy theory. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said. They then moved on to the subject of Biden, and Trump said that “I will ask [Rudolph W. Giuliani] to call you along with the Attorney General.”

AD

AD

Trump went on: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”

And then again: “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to [have] Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.” And then one more time: “I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.”

As Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a news conference Wednesday, Trump invoking Barr “adds another layer of depravity to this conversation,” because it made clear that the U.S. government and Trump’s personal attorney would be working together to force Ukraine to aid Trump’s reelection bid.

AD

Which raises some questions. We know that Giuliani pressured Ukraine to open an investigation that might produce some dirt on Biden and his son. Was Barr involved, as the president wanted? Did he communicate with any Ukrainian officials? Did he have any communication with Giuliani, who was apparently running a kind of shadow State Department? And if Barr did, what could that possibly have to do with his job as America’s chief law enforcement official?

AD

The Justice Department just issued a denial, saying Trump never asked Barr to get involved with Ukraine. Even if that’s true (and let’s just say we should keep an open mind), Barr’s part in this story doesn’t end there.

On Tuesday, Schiff sent a remarkable letter to the attorney general, in which he raised the possibility that the Justice Department “has participated in a dangerous cover-up to protect the President.”

AD

To remind you, when a whistleblower files a complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, the IG determines if the complaint is credible and is of “urgent concern.” If it is, the director of national intelligence then must pass it on to the intelligence committees. Not if the DNI wants to, not if he thinks it has merit, not if he’s in the mood — the DNI “shall” give it to Congress, the law states. But he didn’t.

AD

Why? The Justice Department gave the DNI a written legal opinion justifying his refusal to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint. In his letter, Schiff asks why this happened, suggesting that the Justice Department shouldn’t have overridden what the IG’s conclusion requires the DNI to do:

In effect, the Department appears to have usurped the IC IG’s fact-finding role in an unprecedented manner, and then disguised its reversal of the IC IG’s findings in a purportedly non-partisan legal opinion from the OLC.

In what Schiff referred to in his news conference as a “completely contorted rationalization,” they said that in fact this whole matter was outside the purview of the intelligence community, and therefore it doesn’t constitute an “urgent concern,” and therefore the DNI doesn’t have to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint to Congress.

AD

The Justice Department is run by William Barr, and given the magnitude of this matter, it seems impossible that at a minimum he wouldn’t have been kept informed of every development. What was his role in the production of the opinion telling the DNI to keep the whistleblower’s complaint secret?

AD

At this point we should remind ourselves that the entire reason Barr is attorney general is that he made clear that, unlike his predecessor, he would make protecting Trump his highest priority.

One can’t help but be reminded of the surreal moment at a Senate hearing in May when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) asked Barr if the president or anyone else in the White House had asked or suggested that he open an investigation of anyone. At first, Barr pretended that he didn’t understand the question, as though it were too complex to grasp. Then he spent long seconds gazing into space and muttering before finally claiming he just didn’t know whether that had happened or not.

AD

Perhaps we’ll be able to find out. One thing we know for sure is that if Donald Trump wanted to use the powers of government to cover up his misdeeds, William Barr would be the first person he’d call.

This is a column about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and why you should or should not prefer the former over the latter. But before digging into that question, I’d like call your attention to something that is too often ignored in the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate: The American left’s bark is louder than its bite.

In recent years, socialists and their left-liberal fellow travelers have accrued an unprecedented degree of influence over our nation’s political discourse. As the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis undermined mainstream economic orthodoxy — and radicalized a generation of overeducated, underemployed journalists and academics — the technocracy’s center of gravity shifted leftward. In 2019, the Democrats’ Establishment think tank is agitating for industry-wide collective bargaining, the mainstream media has adopted a reflexively sympathetic attitude toward striking public-sector workers, and conscious capitalists are giving TED Talks on the evils of neoliberalism.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primaries and Hillary Clinton’s devastating weakness in that year’s general election — and the online left’s success in popularizing its interpretations of both phenomena— persuaded many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to stop worrying and learn to love social democracy. At the first three Democratic debates, the middle-ground position on health care was a public option strong enough to jeopardize the viability of private insurance. On higher education, it was free public college for all children from working-class families. On climate, it was “only” $1.7 trillion in green investments, and a mandate for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But the left’s ideological clout far outstrips its material strength. American socialism is heavy on superstructure, light on base. The current trade-union movement is weak by historic standards, representing a piddling 10.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Independent leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have grown since 2016 but still lack the scale and mass working-class membership that made such entities formidable agents of social change in earlier eras of American history. In the electoral realm, progressive challengers scored a couple notable victories in the 2018 primaries but failed to foment a “tea party of the left.” Outside of low-turnout elections in deep-blue districts, organizations like Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and DSA gave Democratic incumbents little cause for fearing their wrath. And where left insurgents did win open primaries in purple territory, they failed to affirm their theory of change: Nominating economic populists unencumbered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s allergy to class-warfare rhetoric and radical reforms like Medicare for All did not fix what’s the matter with Kansas. Sanders-backed ironworker Randy Bryce did worse in Wisconsin’s 1st District last year than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Single-payer supporter Kara Eastman failed to flip Nebraska’s 2nd. The 2018 elections did not prove the electoral necessity of moderation — Warren acolyte Katie Porter pulled out a tough win in a historically Republican California district; Senator Tammy Baldwin’s calls for abolishing private insurance and putting workers on corporate boards proved compatible with winning reelection in a Trump state — but nor did they prove that Sanders-ism an electoral panacea.

Thus far, the 2020 primary has further undermined the notion that Democratic voters will overwhelmingly support radical change if only the left can get the Establishment’s thumbs off the scale. Joe Biden owes his front-runner status less to his party’s high-dollar donors than its high-propensity voters. Few Democratic pooh-bahs went into 2019 favoring Uncle Joe. Many saw Kamala Harris as Hillary’s heiress apparent, while others were so averse to backing Obama’s senescent wingman that they put their chips on the mayor of South Bend instead. But the people (or a plurality of them, anyway) have preferred Biden. The fact that Warren and Sanders are his chief rivals — rather than Harris and Buttigieg — may reflect the radicalization of some segments of the Democratic electorate. But much of the rank and file evinces little interest in their party’s ideological divides. And a significant portion of Democratic-base voters still espouse a preference for ideological moderation (however hazily defined).

Finally, even if the left were to build enthusiastic majoritarian support for a radical break with “Obamaism” among both Democratic-primary voters and the general public, it might still have difficulty enacting its legislative agenda. Both chambers of Congress overrepresent the most conservative elements in American society. And with its six-year terms and immense incumbency advantages, the Senate largely insulates Democrats in even the bluest states from grassroots pressure (see: Feinstein, Dianne).

The left is too weak to enact Sanders’s or Warren’s big plans. Do either of them have a plan for that?

Much of the time, the Democratic left is content to wage its “Bernie vs. Warren” civil war in a parallel universe free of this context. Sanders supporters comb through the Warren campaign’s every utterance on health care for intimations of agnosticism on single-payer, as though the chief obstacle to Medicare for All in 2021 will be the next Democratic president’s lack of backbone rather than the fact that there are currently 14 votes for Bernie’s bill in Chuck Schumer’s caucus (and none of the Democrats who oppose single-payer had any trouble winning renomination in the 2018 primaries). Meanwhile, progressive intellectuals debate the relative merits of Warren’s left-liberalism and Sanders’s “democratic socialism” as though the central question facing the next Democratic administration will be whether to implement the Meidner plan or settle for Denmark’s model of social democracy.

This isn’t to say that there are no areas where Warren’s and Sanders’s disparate worldviews and personal backgrounds could have real substantive implications. The commander-in-chief has immense discretion over foreign policy, and up to now Sanders appears more interested than Warren in radically reforming the Democratic Party’s approach to geopolitics. The president also has considerable power to shape domestic policy through regulatory appointments and creative interpretations of existing statutory authority — forms of “lawfare” to which Warren may be especially well suited.

Given how far the left is from possessing the power it will need to turn its wildest “green dreams” into reality, however, the most worthwhile Bernie-versus-Warren arguments may concern tactics, not policy. Whether Sanders’s approach to expropriating the billionaire class is preferable to Warren’s isn’t a question that’s likely to be of much practical consequence in the medium-term future. But whether his approach to winning elections — and using his power to build up the left’s — is more viable than Warren’s absolutely is.

In recent days, the staunchly pro-Sanders publication Jacobin has made the latter case, arguing that Sanders’s theory of change is both radically distinct from and superior to Warren’s. Refreshingly, the socialist magazine premises its argument on a frank acknowledgement of the left’s sorry state. In its account, Warren may have been a suitable agent of structural change three decades ago, when the grassroots left was still strong enough to arrange “a tense but functional relationship between a reformist administration in the White House and a strong and organized working class that could at least challenge capital’s imperatives.” But in the current context, the left doesn’t command enough divisions to make use of Warren’s technocratic gifts. It needs foot soldiers, not plans. And Bernie Sanders is uniquely capable of reassembling the left’s army because of his deeper commitment to radical, bottom-up change, his greater appeal to blue-collar constituencies, and his more unabashedly adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party.

I find this unconvincing. But Jacobin’s case merits examination, as it’s focused on the right questions: How do we get from where we are to a polity in which our plans actually matter? And is Warren or Sanders more likely to get us there?

The differences between Sanders and Warren may be smaller than they appear (in Jacobin articles, anyway).

One obstacle to a productive debate over whether Warren or Sanders is a more viable agent of change is the temptation to exaggerate the distinctions between their respective modes of operation. In “Elizabeth Warren’s Strategy Within the Democratic Party Is All Wrong,” Jacobin’s (typically incisive) Branko Marcetic falls prey to that impulse. In his column, Marcetic argues that the Massachusetts senator’s reported outreach to the Democratic Establishment betrays her commitment to an “inside strategy” that is bound to fail. The problem with his argument is that its central premise — that Warren’s decision to court power players in the Democratic Party sharply distinguishes her campaign from Sanders’s — appears to be false.

Marcetic’s essay is based on a New York Times story from last month that reported that, in an apparent bid to ingratiate herself with superdelegates, Warren had told influential Democratic brokers that she wanted to build power within the party and wouldn’t be assembling her own independent grassroots army. Sanders’s supporters responded to this news with (gleeful) indignation, as it appeared to heighten the contradictions between his and her theories of change. And yet, the most significant difference ostensibly established by the Times article — that Warren was forswearing the kind of independent organizing that Sanders champions — wasn’t actually any distinction at all. Oddly, Marcetic concedes this point in a parenthetical but declines to address its implications for his broader argument:

On August 26, the New York Times reported that Warren has been aggressively courting Democratic officials behind the scenes, assuring them, in the paper’s telling, that she is a loyal Democrat and does not plan to create her own political or organizing infrastructure outside the party. (The next day, the Association of State Democratic Committees announced that Sanders and a number of other candidates have, like Warren, pledged not to create “any organizing or messaging infrastructure that is parallel or duplicative” to the DNC or state parties.)

Marcetic proceeds to suggest that, even if Warren’s pledge is not as distinctive as it first appeared, her courting of superdelegates is:

Besides trying to convince Democrats that her progressive ideas won’t make her “unelectable,” Warren’s private assurances that she simply wants to breathe new life into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and help the party recapture Congress, the Times notes, also have a politically strategic element. Thanks to a rule change last year, if no single candidate wins an outright majority of delegates in the primaries — a plausible scenario in this crowded field — the superdelegates will once again have a large role in choosing the nominee, this time on the second ballot. And, should it come down to a second ballot, Warren wants their votes.

It’s unclear how easily these overtures to the DNC will sit with Warren’s plans for major structural change in the United States.

This distinction, too, is nonexistent: In May, a Sanders-campaign aide told BuzzFeed News, “We’re taking superdelegates and superdelegates strategy seriously, hence having a team dedicated to delegates who can prepare for multiple convention scenarios. We will be reaching out to them over the course of the campaign. When the senator wins the nomination, he’s eager to work with them to support and unite all the party in the general and beyond.”

There is nothing especially telling about a candidate’s seeking the approval of powerful figures in the party whose nomination he or she is trying to win. To neglect such “inside” tactics would be political malpractice, as the Sanders campaign readily acknowledges.

Nevertheless, differences between each candidate’s relationship with the Democratic Party persist.

All this said, it is true that, as a general matter, Sanders has a more adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party than Warren. He has, of course, refused to join the party for the duration of his congressional career, and he has used that formal independence to criticize the Democratic Establishment with a (generally righteous) fury that Warren has reserved for financial executives. He has also made some efforts to build an independent political infrastructure capable of challenging incumbent Democrats that refuse to get with his program (though he has apparently promised to suspend those efforts upon winning the nomination).

Given these facts, it isn’t wholly implausible to view the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate as a proxy for a broader dispute over the left’s relationship to the Democratic Party. Namely: Should progressives and socialists seek to co-opt the Democratic brand, build power within its institutions, and seek accommodation with its leadership, out of a recognition that the left is strong enough (and, for now, ideologically fashionable enough) to exert influence as one interest group within the Democrats’ big tent but far too weak to establish an independent political identity capable of capturing the loyalties of the Democratic base? Or is the Democratic brand too toxic with the working class — and its leadership too entrenched and aligned with capital — to be worth co-opting? Which is to say: Is popularizing a socialist identity that can bridge America’s partisan divide and mobilize its nonvoters — while building an independent party-like entity capable of disciplining its candidates and putting the fear of obsolescence into the Democratic leadership — the only path to radical reform?

It is not clear to me that Sanders is personally committed to the latter theory of change (given his aforementioned pledge, and decades of productive cooperation with the Democratic leadership, it seems possible that becoming blue America’s standard-bearer would dispel his reservations about working within the two-party system). But many of his most enthusiastic, socialist supporters are; Jacobin’s editors, and many members of the DSA, proselytize an electoral strategy of building an independent socialist party that competes on the Democratic ballot line when necessary. And even if a President Sanders does not directly participate in that project, the election of a self-avowed socialist would surely abet such efforts more than that of a staunchly pro-market progressive Democrat.

So, for the sake of argument, let’s stipulate that Bernie plans to violate his pledges and brook no compromise with the Democrats’ old regime. What is the evidence for the premise that forswearing all accommodation with the Democratic Party would maximize the left’s gains?

Toward the end of his column, Marcetic gestures at one answer:

An insurgent movement like the Tea Party made heavy use of confrontational tactics and primary challenges to wrench the Republican Party toward its end of the political spectrum. Donald Trump’s antagonistic relationship with a GOP establishment that largely opposed him didn’t stop him from both winning the Republican primary and the general election, and today’s GOP has been refashioned in Trump’s image, with even his fiercest Republican critics now fully signing on to his agenda. Trump did this not by convincing members of the GOP establishment that he was correct, but by rallying voters and making it virtually impossible for Republicans to both keep their jobs and oppose him. If the next Democratic president fails to achieve something similar, they won’t just face an obstructionist Republican bloc, but a host of conservative Democrats who will stand as a barrier to their agenda, just as Obama did in 2009…Only a direct challenge to the power of those elites will enable a progressive president to overcome it.

There are several problems with this analogy. First, it is not clear why pursuing diplomacy with Establishment factions — while seeking control of a party’s apparatus — is incompatible with abetting some primary challenges (Warren’s staff has significant ties to the organization Justice Democrats, which exists to orchestrate such campaigns). Second, Donald Trump absolutely sought reconciliation with the GOP Establishment upon winning his party’s nomination in 2016, noticeably adjusted his platform to suit its wishes, and owed his victory largely to the strength of the RNC’s infrastructure (his own campaign being a ramshackle mess). Third, Trump’s fiercest critics have not actually “fully” signed on to his agenda. In fact, Republican senators have repeatedly rebuffed the president on his signature issue, voting down Trump’s proposed reductions in legal immigration by wide margins. One might therefore interpret Trump as a testament to the limitations of the inside game. But then does anyone really believe that America’s nativists would be exercising more power in our politics had they begrudged Trump his accommodations with the GOP’s corporate wing or attempted to popularize an independent political identity, instead of seeking to claim the Republican Party as their own? And can anyone argue that Trump has been too soft on his intraparty critics?

The lesson of Trump’s failure to rally Republican senators behind his immigration agenda is that it is extremely hard to force a U.S. senator to vote for something he or she strongly opposes — whether through direct challenges or backroom cajoling. Six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and, in many cases, the ability to obstruct all of a president’s other priorities make it very hard for a White House to hold any senator’s feet to the fire. Putting the fear of a credible primary challenge into all 33 of the Democratic senators who’ve withheld their support for Bernie’s health-care bill looks implausible on its face. And given the left’s showing in House races in 2018 (not to mention its sorry efforts at Senate challenges), the task appears even more implausible upon closer examination.

The left’s weakness makes it trivially easy to demonstrate how someone else’s approach to creating radical change will prove inadequate. It is much harder to make a persuasive case for one’s own. Sanders supporters are right that nothing less than a political revolution can make Medicare for All and a Green New Deal realities. But the evidence that Bernie is capable of fomenting such a revolution is limited. On the one hand, Sanders has assembled impressive small-dollar donor armies and volunteer networks. His ascent has undoubtedly abetted DSA’s growth. And he has used his vast email list to recruit reinforcements for various labor actions and protests, thereby demonstrating his commitment to social movements and to non-electoral forms of political contestation.

On the other hand, Sanders has had a national platform for three years now. He has built up an independent organization and traveled the country proselytizing for class struggle. And none of it has been sufficient for his acolytes to dominate Democratic primaries, or to win him a broader base of support for his 2020 run than he had in 2016, or even to keep his approval rating from slipping underwater. Although one can point to some polls showing Sanders with an enviable favorability rating, RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows the public disapproving of the socialist senator by a margin of 46.3 to 43.1 percent. It is possible that Sanders’s popularity and influence will balloon once he attains power. But it’s worth noting that even Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s historic popularity — and the existence of strong labor, socialist, and communist movements — were insufficient to render FDR’s attempted “purge” of anti–New Deal Democrats in the 1938 primaries successful.

In light of these facts, is it not conceivable that a president more closely aligned with the Democratic Party — and less openly hostile to its key power centers — would actually be able to get senators like Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema to swallow marginally more progressive legislation in 2021 than a president with an independent political identity who projected contempt for their wing of the party? Put differently, would such senators feel more inclined to perform their independence from a socialist president who’d deliberately stoked the enmity of centrist Democrats, or a “capitalist to her bones” progressive president who’d nursed Third Wayers’ threatened egos?

I do not want to live in a republic where maximizing the number of Americans with quality health insurance requires buttering up Joe Manchin in back rooms. But are we sure that that isn’t the republic we’ll be living in for the foreseeable future?

To be sure, many of Sanders’s socialist supporters see their project as a generational one. And the incremental benefits of maximizing the left’s clout in the Democratic Party today (with all the distasteful, coalition-solidifying compromises that ostensibly requires) may pale next to the radical possibilities that militancy could open up tomorrow. After all, even if righteous intransigence does not immediately inspire a mobilization capable of cowing centrist Democrats, the struggle could facilitate the recruitment of progressives into the independent, mass-membership socialist party, a development sought by Jacobin. And yet, even if the goal is to maximize the left’s power in 2030, it’s not obvious why building a party-like structure outside of the Democratic tent is a more promising strategy than competing for authority within it.

As Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman has ably explained, American election law treats the two major parties as state institutions and uses discriminatory ballot-access rules to stymie third parties. For this reason, he insists that socialists make peace with competing on the Democratic ballot line, even as they build a “a membership-run organization with its own name, its own logo, its own identity and therefore its own platform, and its own ideology.” And yet the institutionalization of the two major parties, combined with partisan polarization, makes the task of popularizing an alternative, left-wing political identity enormously difficult. The American left will achieve nothing without the backing of the black working class. And while not all African-Americans proudly identify as Democrats, a very hefty percentage of them feel a profound loyalty to the party of civil rights and Barack Obama. And the same is true for many of the left’s other key constituencies. At present, the Democratic Party is an institution that manages to put Latinx housekeepers in Las Vegas in coalition with white industrial laborers in Dearborn, black church ladies in Charleston, and long-winded politics bloggers in Manhattan. The party’s infrastructure is relatively porous on the local level, where even the most formidable Democratic “machines” have proved unable to fend off challenges from charismatic bartenders. And while the party’s base voters have strong partisan identities, many are open to a wide range of definitions of what it means to be a true Democrat in ideological terms; some recent surveys suggest Bernie Sanders is the most popular second choice among Joe Biden backers.

Given these conditions, why isn’t commandeering the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, platform, and considerable social base not a simpler, faster, and more viable path to power than attempting to build an entirely new party and political identity and then hijacking the Democrats’ ballot line — in the ostensible hope that voters who affirmatively choose to register as Democrats will look more favorably on leftist primary challengers who disparage their party than on candidates who claim membership in it?

Proletarians prefer L.L. Bean?

In “Elizabeth Warren Is Thirty Years Too Late,” Connor Kilpatrick and Bhaskar Sunkara do not address this question directly. But their analysis suggests that the existing Democratic coalition is too heavily reliant on affluent voters for the party to serve as an effective vehicle of radical change, and that Bernie’s relative distance from the taint of the Democratic brand and greater affinity for class politics and bottom-up organizing make him uniquely capable of winning back the legions of working-class voters whom Third Way Democrats lost to right-wing populism or political apathy.

Like Marcetic’s piece, Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s draws strong conclusions from limited evidence. The authors observe that Sanders’s support among Democratic-primary voters is markedly less white and more working-class than Warren’s. In fact, many surveys have suggested that Warren owes her viability to overwhelming support among professional-class white liberals — or, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara describe them, “Patagonia Democrats.” This distinction between the class composition of the two progressive candidates’ nascent coalitions has become a popular talking point among Sanders supporters. And it may have some validity. In Vermont, Sanders has regularly outperformed other Democrats with white, non-college-educated voters. It’s plausible that his brand of politics may play better with a critical mass of secular, rural, white swing voters in Wisconsin, and therefore that he would be a stronger general-election candidate than Warren.

But Kilpatrick and Sunkara use this polling data to make a far more sweeping claim. Sanders’s greater appeal with blue-collar Democratic-primary voters doesn’t merely suggest he can improve on Clinton’s margins in Kenosha County, but that he can reorient the polarization of U.S. politics along class lines. In their telling, Warren’s coalition is potentially broad “enough to keep Republicans from the White House but not Congress or state legislatures. It would be yet another coalition that could win but never govern.” Bernie’s working-class coalition, by contrast, would have the numbers and self-interest necessary to force radical change through political institutions that were designed to thwart it.

That America’s low- and middle-income workers do not share a class consciousness or partisan coalition is a genuine constraint on radical economic reform. Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s commitment to overcoming that constraint is commendable. But the fact that Sanders commands the loyalties of a disproportionately working-class 16 percent of the Democratic-primary electorate scarcely qualifies as evidence that his appeal with non-college-educated voters is so powerful it can radically realign American politics. After all, Biden boasts even stronger support among nonwhite and working-class Democrats. Does that mean that nominating Uncle Joe would reassemble the New Deal coalition? Sanders supporters might dismiss the racial and socioeconomic diversity of Biden’s support as a product of mere name recognition. But Warren backers can play that card against Sanders too: In the last week, multiple polls have shown her not only gaining more non-college-educated and non-white support as her campaign rolls on, but actually outperforming Sanders with such voters.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

Regardless, the evidence that no Democratic candidate can drastically change the party’s class composition in the near term is considerable. The movement of non-college-educated white voters to the right — and college-educated white ones to the left — is not an exceptionally American phenomenon. Rather, it has been happening for decades across much of Western Europe. The left attributes this development to center-left parties’ myriad betrayals of their working-class constituencies in the neoliberal era. And that is certainly part of the story. But it is also the case that non-college-educated white voters in the West have, in the aggregate, long evinced a preference for restricted immigration in opinion polls. It’s conceivable that, irrespective of economic policy, the demographic shifts of the past three decades were bound to increase the salience of immigration in partisan politics and thus drive a significant portion of the white working class away from center-left parties with bases in diverse urban centers.

But whatever the origins of this development, there is little evidence that left-wing parties can rapidly reverse it by embracing more robustly class-conscious rhetoric and ambitiously redistributionist economic policies. When Britain’s Labour Party elected a democratic socialist as its leader and campaigned on its most radical manifesto in a generation, it gained a historic number of seats in the 2017 general election — by, among other things, flipping Tory-held districts in the wealthiest parts of London. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the bulk of Sanders-aligned, working-class House candidates in 2018 did not have much more success at winning non-college-educated white voters than did centrist Democrats running in similar districts (Richard Ojeda notwithstanding). None of this means that the left must give up on uniting the bulk of America’s multiethnic working class into a single party. But it does suggest that such a project may require years of patient organizing (and demographic replacement), rather than the nomination of any particular presidential candidate.

If Kilpatrick and Sunkara overestimate Sanders’s capacity to realign American politics, they understate how much the Democratic Party can accomplish with its existing coalition. The U.S. economy does not currently serve the average college-educated voter very well. And most of the marquee items on Sanders’s agenda are in the objective self-interest of virtually all affluent suburbanites. Charles Koch may have little use for free public college, universal health care, more generous Social Security benefits, or child-care subsidies. But the typical upper-middle-class family does. Meanwhile, the indebted and underemployed millennial sons and daughters of the professional middle class are one of the most reliably left-wing constituencies in the country and make up no small percentage of Jacobin’s subscriber base and DSA’s membership. There are limitations on what this coalition can achieve. But in California, the existing Democratic coalition just secured subsidized health care for undocumented immigrants and employment rights for exploited “gig economy” workers, over the furious objections of multibillion-dollar companies. Under Barack Obama, meanwhile, it extended Medicaid to millions of people, likely saving nearly 20,000 working-class Americans from premature deaths. The lamentable shortcomings of Obama’s tenure do not nullify that achievement.

Sunkara and Kilpatrick are right to find no contentment in such marginal gains. But by projecting contempt for one of the voting blocs that made those gains possible — and asserting that the existing Democratic Party can “never govern” — they risk projecting an air of indifference toward such reforms and the working-class people who’ve benefited from them (an indifference that I know neither writer actually feels). Socialists must always guard against the impression that they are more invested in chasing an ideological abstraction than delivering concrete benefits to the exploited classes they claim to champion. As a wise (and/or violently racist and jingoistic) man once said, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” For many Democratic-primary voters, expressions of contempt for the organization that represents their best line of defense against racist, reactionary rule can be deeply alienating. Which points to the most immediate strategic upside of Warren’s “inside strategy”: Polls have repeatedly found that Sanders attracts a relatively high level of disapproval or discomfort among Democratic-primary voters, while Warren boasts an aberrantly low one. This reality, combined with the intensity of elite Democratic opposition to Sanders, invites the question of whether Warren is the only progressive with sufficient breadth of appeal (among Democratic voters and power brokers) to prevent Biden from securing the nomination — in which case Sanders’s theoretical superiority as a general-election candidate or president would be moot. The answer to that question is far from clear, in my view. But it’s hard to see how Sanders can negate its premise without stepping up his “inside game.”

All this may read as an elaborate endorsement of Warren. But I do not intend it as such. That Sanders evinces more interest in radically revising American foreign policy is no small thing. Further, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara note, in a context where the left is materially weak, the personal ideological commitments of elected leaders take on a heightened importance. And there is no question that Bernie Sanders has a more deeply rooted ideological commitment to radical politics than does Elizabeth Warren.

But too many prominent arguments for Sanders’s superiority consist of easily debunked distinctions between the two left-wing candidates or blithely unsubstantiated assertions that Bernie is uniquely capable of fomenting a political revolution and thus of bending the Democratic Establishment and U.S. Senate to his will. The first mode of argument risks alienating undecided liberals and obscuring Sanders’s genuinely distinctive merits. The second threatens to replace rigorous reflection on the obstacles to radical change in the United States with magical thinking — and a much-needed debate over how to overcome those impediments with the recitation of rival dogmas.

Which would be unfortunate. In this country, optimism of the intellect is a luxury that no “Champagne socialist” nor “Patagonia progressive” can afford."

She now calls for him to return to testify under oath.

The Justice Department is trying to deny Barr has any role in this fiasco. (“An initial Justice Department statement on Barr’s role issued at the same moment the call notes were made public seemed only to rule out the attorney general being asked to work with Ukraine on such a probe, but a subsequent clarification broadened the denial to cover any presidential request to Barr to launch an inquiry into Biden.”) Even if this is true, the Justice Department found there was nothing wrong with Trump’s conduct. Are we to believe Barr didn’t know about that either? Constitutional scholar Larry Tribe tells me, “It’s inconceivable that Barr didn’t know, and the decision to treat the president’s manifestly criminal conversation with Ukraine’s leader, a mix of bribery and extortion, as not worthy of a referral for further investigation seems to me inexplicable unless one assumes either corrupt motives or gross stupidity or both.”

Barr is not the only member of the administration who is in legal and career peril. Most importantly, it is essential to determine what Vice President Pence knew of Trump’s efforts, whether he advised against this kind of conduct and whether he was involved in the pressure campaign to find dirt on Biden. When we move into the realm of impeachment, it is obviously necessary to determine if the vice president, in case of removal or resignation, is fit to take over. Congress should move swiftly to subpoena him and obtain all documents relating to this travesty.

Indeed, anyone who facilitated the aid for dirt campaign should be identified and compelled to step down. Whether it was acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney who inserted himself into the aid process by arranging a holdup of funds to Ukraine or Defense or State officials who carried out these directives or had knowledge of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s private secretary of state operation, they must be identified and their conduct evaluated.

It is noteworthy that we now learn that, according to The Post, acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire ""threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” This suggests two things: First, the White House was engaged in an attempt to obstruct Congress’s investigation, and, second, it is possible for officials to resist illegal or immoral orders.

As we learn the full extent of this assault on our electoral system, we will see just how far the culpability extends. Their decision to stay in the administration and serve an unfit and reckless president might have lifelong consequences for a whole bunch of people.

AMITE CITY, La.— The float carrying Gov. John Bel Edwards passed by quickly, and the tossed beads and campaign cups — “Putting Louisiana First” — landed a few feet short of Randy Foulks.

Foulks, the 68-year-old owner of an air conditioning company, likes Edwards. But he wasn't exactly jumping for campaign swag.

“I'm disappointed that he raised taxes when he said he wouldn't,” Foulks said. “I know he's got a big heart for this state. He took the bull by the horns when that storm came through here. But it's the taxes, man. Something's got to be done.”

Edwards, who was elected governor four years ago in a rout, is seeking a second term in a state that has largely moved away from Democrats. He has stayed far away from the party's presidential race, angered local and national Democrats by signing a strict abortion limitation law and expanded Medicaid. But he's in a tight battle for reelection against two Republicans running as allies of President Trump and enemies of a 2016 sales tax hike.

""[People] may not agree with everything that we've done,” Edwards said in an interview. “But you cannot, with any justification, say that Louisiana's not better off. We are running surpluses now, not deficits. We have an uninsured rate that's lower than the national average. Now, who would have thought that would ever be possible in the state of Louisiana?”

Louisiana's Oct. 12 election will test whether a socially conservative Democrat can still get elected in the South — whether it's still possible to excite liberal voters, mollify conservative voters and hold onto a job. With abortion practically off the table, Republicans have attacked Edwards's support for LGBT nondiscrimination laws. With unemployment falling under 5 percent, they credit the president's tax cuts and ask why Edwards can't govern more like Trump.

“We're the only state in the nation that lost jobs in the last 12 months,” said Rep. Ralph Abraham, the leading Republican candidate, in an interview from the sidelines of a Louisiana Tech football game. “He's got to own this stuff.” The congressman, who like Edwards is a military veteran, was there for one of the game's multiple salutes to the troops.

Republicans, who dominate Louisiana's state legislature, always saw Edwards as an accidental governor. He won 56 percent of the vote against Sen. David Vitter; one year later, Hillary Clinton won just 39 percent of the vote in the state. In 2015, Edwards benefited from two factors that disappeared right after the election: the unpopularity of two-term Gov. Bobby Jindal and the candidacy of Vitter. The senator, who had won reelection after admitting to paying for prostitutes (“a serious sin in my past”), was particularly vulnerable to Edwards's character-first campaign.

“The choice for governor couldn't be clearer,” one of Edwards's TV ads declared. “John Bel Edwards, who answered our country's call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute's call, minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers.”

Edwards's two opponents this year, Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, have no such problems. Abraham's campaign has emphasized his work as a family doctor; Republicans call him “Doc” more than they call him “Ralph.”

The wealthy Rispone is running as an outsider, the closest thing state Republicans can get to their own Trump. Rispone has spent millions on ads attacking Edwards over “sanctuary cities” and even a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill; he's also gone after Abraham, dredging up an accusation that he used his salary to buy a plane instead of donating the income to charity. (The attack, previously used by Democrats, ignores that Abraham did give his salary to charity until congressional ethics prevented him from taking income from his medical practice.)

“I'm the grandson of legal immigrants, who worked hard and played by the rules” Rispone says in one of his omnipresent TV spots, drawling the word “legal” for emphasis.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff. Edwards has consistently polled north of 40 percent, with his rivals in the 20s. But Republicans like their chances with either Abraham or Rispone, who have tag-teamed Edwards as a tax hiker who can't be trusted on social issues. The strategy is twofold: hoping that Democrats are less enthused to support an antiabortion governor and firing up the Republican vote by warning of “sanctuary cites,” crime waves and a breakdown of gender norms in the state's schools.

“As a doctor,” Abraham says in one TV spot, “I can assure you there are only two genders.”

Edwards has responded by constantly reminding voters of why their taxes went up at all — Jindal had blown up the state's deficit and Republicans got on board with the tax hike.

“We had already cut higher education deeper than any other state in the nation,” he said. “We'd already raised tuition more than any other state in the nation. People know that. The economy wasn't working.” Edwards has stood behind a gas tax increase that's supported by a plurality of voters but stalled in the legislature. In the first debate, he made a lonely promise not to cut taxes “until we know that we won’t go back into a structural budget deficit.”

Medicaid expansion, which Edwards brought to the state by executive action, hasn't reshaped the race. Republicans have not said outright that they'd reverse it, even as they support a lawsuit led by Republican attorneys general that would rip up the Affordable Care Act. (Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, is simultaneously suing to kill the ACA and promising to protect its most popular components.)

Republicans are not running against Medicaid expansion per se, focusing instead on troubles with how it was implemented and on the theory that it's better to get insurance through private employers than the government.

“Look, I'm a family doctor,” Abraham said. “There are those that need that safety net. We will take care of those people. My beef is that we've got over a hundred million dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we've got over 1,600 people on the Medicaid rolls who are making over $100,000.” Abraham and other Republicans have attacked the implementation of expansion while navigating around the implications: that they would knock Louisianans off the Medicaid rolls.

A bill banning most abortions, which won't go into effect unless courts uphold a similar one in Mississippi, took a toll on the governor's Democratic support. Karen Carter Peterson, the state party chair and a member of the Democrats' legislative minority, even singled him out for criticism. But it also deprived Republicans of an issue, and they've spent the final weeks of the race with a different message to conservatives: Edwards is too lenient on LGBT rights.

Abraham described Edwards as two-faced on abortion — “he has a Planned Parenthood operative as his secretary of health” — but had even more to say about the state conducting a school survey that asked children about their sexual orientation.

“We need to let teachers teach and let the parents be the parents,” Abraham said. “If they want to have that discussion with their children, that's their business. The state should have no role in that agenda of social experimentation.”

Edwards has defended his support for gay rights, arguing that opposition will backfire on his opponents. “Discrimination and prejudice are not Louisiana values,” he said, when asked to respond to Abraham. “I think you have a candidate whose campaign is failing, and he's desperate, and he's trying to go back to some of those social wedge issues that have been used successfully in the past. That is not Louisiana today.”

On Saturday, as Edwards walked around the annual Fried Chicken Festival in New Orleans, his coalition came into view. Chrishelle DuPree, 46, rushed over to get a photo with her governor, even though she'd hated the abortion law.

“Abortion should be a woman's right,” Dupree said. “I totally don't agree with the governor on that. But I won't vote against him because of the abortion law. I was really pissed at first, but he's Catholic, so I understand it, and I can't let get a Republican in office. The hell with that!”

Moments later, the governor took a selfie with Steve Beatty, 64, who'd voted for Edwards in 2015 and then for Trump in 2016.

“I'm a Christian, and I believe every life needs a chance, like the governor,” Beatty explained. “I heard Franklin Graham say the night before the Trump election: You're not voting for Trump, you're voting for conservative values. I feel that way about the governor.”

But Edwards never supported Trump; in the final stretch, Republicans hope for that to make the difference, and point out that no incumbent governor who was forced into a runoff has won it. While Abraham has been massively outspent, his plan to win the runoff was for national attention to swing to Louisiana, and for the president to throw in behind him. Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.

“I want him down here,” Abraham said. “I want him to come down to Louisiana and have one of those MAGA rallies. He's welcome to come as many times as he wants.”

No national Democratic figure would be so welcome in Louisiana. Edwards had cheerfully ignored the party's race for president. Asked about the debate the 2020 candidates were having about Medicare-for-all, he emphasized that the current system was working for Louisiana. Asked about the president, he said he had worked with him plenty.

“I already got more than I can say grace over on my plate,” he said. “He typically doesn't go in the states where he's not going to win, and so I think he would be reluctant to come here. I would remind you that Democrats last year nationwide picked up seven new governorships. And I think the president went to just about all of those states.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care. Apart from an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show and some tart statements, the former vice president has stuck to his previous campaign plan, attacking the administration for undermining the Affordable Care Act.

“Many Republican legislatures and governors are dodging their duties to their constituents by rejecting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion opportunity,” he said in a Thursday morning statement. When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.

“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night. “So I’m not at all surprised I’ve become the object of his affection and attention. The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?

Up to now, the president has been less relevant in primary politics than expected. Liberal activists — from the Sunrise Movement to Moms Demand Action to labor leaders — have been driving the policy conversation; the president has made cameos by attacking “socialism” or amplifying stories that ran in conservative media, rarely reaching Democrats, who tend to tune him out.

But the Ukraine story is taking Democrats to territory that to them feels both terrifyingly familiar and worryingly uncertain. Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him. Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.

“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress. “There were legitimate questions with the way that Hillary Clinton handled her email server. But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story. Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.

That's more than have endorsed any other candidate, but it's a fraction of the support Clinton had at this time in the race; by the time news broke about her use of a private email server, a majority of congressional Democrats had already endorsed her. It was in their interest to defend Clinton, whom they always saw as the likely nominee. They are not as sure what will happen to Biden. Even though they believe him, and not Trump, they have seen the president make stuff up and get away with it.

So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president. At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.

“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said. “Trump will smear whoever the Democratic nominee is, and Democrats must be united in rejecting his tawdry politics of hate, lies and personal attacks.”

“I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,” Sanders said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked whether he had concerns about Hunter Biden. Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment. You guys write very perceptive articles on these things and I’ll let you make that judgment.” One day later, asked whether her own ethics plan would allow the children of vice presidents to take lucrative foreign jobs, Warren said “no,” then admitted that she had to check the plan again. Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.

Democratic voters, meanwhile, don't seem to be moving. At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences. Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack. She’d gotten to know the former vice president years earlier, when he got to know her son, who had an intellectual disability.

“He called my son when he was in the hospital. He invited us to the inauguration,” said Heddens, a longtime state legislator. “It is going to be a nasty, nasty election. But I think most of the electorate, most of the people, are tired of this stuff. And I think Joe, in particular, is in a good position to push back against it.”

But other Democrats, with fresh and painful memories of 2016, were more worried. Janet Wahl, 74, said at the same gathering that one reason she was supporting Warren over Biden was that she wanted “new blood” and hated to see Biden dragged into the fray.

“I feel it's horrible to do to anybody, and it’s horrible to do to him in particular,” Wahl said. “But Joe knew what he was getting into. He stepped up to do this again, and he knew how dirty politics could be.”

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, “Your Choice.” The Indiana Democrat's third Iowa spot conceals a negative message inside a positive one. “If you’re happy with the private insurance you’ve got, my plan would let you stick with it — if you want,” he says. “Now, others say it’s Medicare-for-all, or nothing.” This is the third ad Iowans will have seen from a presidential candidate warning them against Medicare-for-all. A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley). “It takes an entire village of politicians to rig the system,” Steyer says. “That’s why we need term limits; to make Washington work for you.” Term limits are part of Steyer's government change agenda, alongside national ballot measures that would let voters decide major issues; they have not recently been popular with Democratic voters.

Bernie Sanders — 19% ( 2)

Of several recent polls that have shown Elizabeth Warren battling Joe Biden for the lead in their primary, this might be the one with the most Warren-friendly news. The reason: California is the first racially diverse primary state where she has shown strength and where neither of her closest competitors has a dominating lead with nonwhite voters.

Here, Warren leads the field by 18 points among white non-Hispanic voters and by 14 points among Asian Americans. Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent. (Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India, polls at only 5 percent with Asian Americans.)





Would you be excited if this candidate became the Democratic nominee? (Quinnipiac, 561 Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 70%

Joe Biden — 56%

Bernie Sanders — 55%

Kamala Harris — 49%

Pete Buttigieg — 46%

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary. Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.

Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent. By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals. The “excitement” margin among those voters for Biden is just seven points; by a 12-point margin, those voters say they would not be excited about a Sanders nomination.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He joined the UAW's picket line in Detroit on Wednesday, two days after Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden had rallied with striking workers, and ahead of a planned visit to a Reno picket line by Pete Buttigieg.

Joe Biden. He has continued to campaign against the Trump administration’s waivers that allow conservative states to limit access to Medicaid, in between attacks from the president about Ukraine; he also announced a wave of endorsements from Iowa teachers as part of “Educators for Biden.”

Kamala Harris. She’s opening a campaign office in Oakland on Sunday, after a wave of polls have showed her falling behind in her home state and even in the Bay Area.

Julián Castro. He’s turning a weekend in Austin, where the Texas Tribune Festival is being held, into a major homecoming: an appearance at a Latino turnout rally, a stop at a voter turnout bus tour, and a “women for Castro” brunch.

Michael Bennet. He’s also speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, interviewed by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

Amy Klobuchar. She’ll be in Austin over the weekend for the Texas Tribune Festival and the Voto Latino turnout event.

Beto O’Rouke. He’ll round out the Texas Tribune lineup, sitting for a Saturday interview with MSNBC’s Garrett Haake.

John Delaney. He’s making another trip to Iowa, with six weekend stops in six counties in the central part of the state.

Marianne Williamson. She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The race for labor's endorsement. Four years ago, as nearly every major union either endorsed Hillary Clinton's nomination or stayed neutral in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders got a lot of help from California. The Oakland-based National Nurses United got behind Sanders early and spent millions of dollars to support him; the smaller National Union of Health Care Workers, also based there, endorsed him handily.

This year, NNU hasn't made its pick yet, and the NUHW just finished an interactive endorsement process that ended with a split decision: Warren and Sanders. Candidates gave video interviews, then the union's 15,000 members voted online, with ballot space for three choices. Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.

The split endorsement was mostly an embarrassment for Harris, who had won the union's support in her California races. It's also a good look at how the momentum of the race is affecting the endorsement process that most unions have only just begun. No candidate looks like a sure thing for the nomination, as Clinton did four years ago. Sanders, a dream candidate for labor in 2015, has lost ground against his rivals, one of whom (Warren) is equally appealing to some labor organizers. Sanders has made solidarity with workers a key component of his campaign, even using his voter contact list to drive support and attention toward strikes.

Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.

Reviews from some quarters weren’t favorable:

The transcript proves the #FakeNews got it WRONG!

In the instanalysis on Fox News, host Bret Baier said, “I don’t see eight times Joe Biden being mentioned. I count three, tangentially. So some of the earlier reporting may have been something different.” Fox News correspondent Catherine Herridge said, “There are not multiple references, as widely reported, to the former vice president and his son. Based on our count, there’s a key reference and then some follow-on references, so a handful, approximately three.” Later on, host Harris Faulkner referred directly to the Journal’s reporting: “It says that the look into Joe Biden was mentioned eight times, when in fact, the first time you hear Rudy Giuliani’s name on it is from the president of Ukraine and I can only find six instances of anybody’s name, north of a couple of times, and it was Giuliani.”

Also on Fox News, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) said, “I didn’t see Joe Biden’s name mentioned in there eight times.""

Well, the Wall Street Journal never made that representation. To repeat, it reported that Trump had urged Zelensky “about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump’s potential 2020 opponent.” So how does that claim compare with the “Memorandum of Telephone Conversation”?

As ABC News reports in a detailed breakdown of the document, there are eight distinct Trump requests for a favor/assistance with an investigation. Not all of them reference Giuliani by name, but the message is clear through repetition: Get with Rudy on this!

AD

A Wall Street Journal spokesman sent the Erik Wemple Blog this note: “The call record released today is not a word-by-word transcript, and while we do not know the totality of the conversation, this record clearly shows multiple references to Mr. Giuliani and a proposed investigation, which supports our earlier reporting.”

AD

Bolding added to highlight a key point. Fine print on the document reads, “A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.” There are ellipses in the document that could be swallowing relevant portions of the presidential conversation. They also could be swallowing meandering Trump gibberish that defies transcription, even description.

Whatever the case, the reporting of the Journal — and The Post, as well — was “basically on target,” concluded Fox News media correspondent Howard Kurtz.

AD

Correct. In his public comments regarding this scandal, Trump has complained about “fake news” and “corrupt reporting.” In a remarkable twist of events, however, Trump himself authorized the release of a “Memorandum of Telephone Conversation” that corroborated this “fake news.” Thanks for confirming, Mr. President.

The Investigations

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE: Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before Congress starting at 9 a.m. this morning (in open and closed hearings) about the explosive whistleblower complaint that has triggered a historic impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The nation's top intelligence official will be grilled about his handling of the complaint concerning Trump's interactions with Ukraine and his asking its president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Democrats are expected to press Maguire to cough up details about why the complaint was withheld until yesterday from lawmakers and instead channeled to the Justice Department, where officials determined there was nothing to see there.

What DOJ did: Steven A. Engel, the head of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, argued in a memo “that it was lawful for [Maguire] to refuse to turn the whistleblower complaint over to Congress — a stance that the Trump administration began to back off of as Democrats stepped up talk of potentially impeaching the president,” reported the New York Times's Charlie Savage, Michael Schmidt, and Julian Barnes report.

Per senior Justice officials, Maguire "" … made a criminal referral [to DOJ], passing to the department the inspector general’s concern that campaign finance laws might have been violated,” per The Post's Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett.

Last week : "" … the Justice Department decided there was not enough evidence to proceed with a campaign finance investigation. The decision, senior [DOJ] officials said, was made by Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department’s criminal division. They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision,” per Matt and Devlin.

New line of inquiry: “The intelligence officer who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint,” Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes report.

“The intelligence officer who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint,” Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes report. And: ""The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored,"" report my colleagues Matt, Devlin, Carol D. Leonnig and Shane Harris.

The anti-Corey Lewandowski: Maguire, his peers told Power Up, is expected to be the antithesis of Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who last week turned in a mocking and brash performance on the Hill.

Despite his “acting” title, it's unlikely the acting DNI head will treat the high-stakes appearance as an audition for an audience of one:

“I can't imagine anyone who cares less about that — if he were acting, nominated, or confirmed, he will be the exact same straightforward guy, providing the answers the best he can,” Michael Leitner, the former head of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center director, told Power Up. “It's just an observation having worked with the guy.”

Democrats are expected to hone in on who exactly instructed Maguire to withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress against the urging of intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined the complaint was of “urgent concern.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) accused Maguire of not responding to the complaint in an appropriate or timely manner. But yesterday evening, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees received the complaint in full.

Maguire denied any wrongdoing in a statement released Tuesday:

“In light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,” Maguire said.

“I am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately,” Maguire added. “I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.”

The intelligence community, under attack from a president who has consistently politicized it, will also be watching closely:

“How do you square the talking points distributed from this White House with the reality of what the DNI and the intelligence community has said behind closed doors?,"" a Democratic House source asked Power Up. “Will Maguire note the massive contradiction or protect a president who has pitted the intelligence community against each other?”

“Everyone has seen the talking points from the White House and it's literally lies,” the source added of the talking points the White House accidentally distributed yesterday to Hill Democrats.

“The way Maguire has handled this situation has not endeared him to the people he's working with,” a former intelligence official told us.

Maguire was not Trump's first choice for the position: Trump initially nominated Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) to replace Dan Coats after denying then-deputy director Sue Gordon the job. Trump withdrew Ratcliffe's name, however, after concerns he was too political. Maguire's background mirrors what former peers described as a duty to protect the intelligence community:

“A former Navy SEAL, Maguire retired from the U.S. Navy in 2010 after serving 36 years. He was director of the National Counterterrorism Center before his role in the Trump administration,” CNN's Chandeleis Duster reports.

“… Maguire was viewed as a steady hand by Democrats and Republicans alike when he was named by Mr. Trump in August to be acting director of national intelligence after the president pushed his Senate-confirmed predecessor, Daniel Coats, to step down. The president also pushed out Sue Gordon, a career intelligence official who served as Mr. Coats’s deputy,” the Wall Street Journal's Warren Strobel and Dustin Volz report.

But the extent of the tension between the White House and Maguire over the whistleblower's complaint came to light yesterday: our colleagues Greg Miller, Shane Harris and Karoun Demirjian report that the acting director “threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.”

“The officials said that [Maguire], who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday.”

Maguire and the White House denied the story. However, “other officials said that Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July.”

Bottom line — or not: “How this surfaced and how it is now in the public is really a sideshow,” a source who worked with Maguire previously said. “This is about the president and the constitution now.”

At The White House

NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT: The whistleblower's ""identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint, the people said — adding that the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,"" the Times's Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes first reported.

The whistle-blower ""heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had 'abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,'"" according to a Justice Department memo ""which referred only to a single phone call between Mr. Trump and an unnamed foreign leader.""

On The Hill

🚨 218 MEMBERS: A majority of the House now supports opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to our colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips and Kevin Schaul's definitive list.

The numbers: 217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican).

217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican). Watch this: 25 of those members would go as far as voting today to impeach Trump. Remember, it takes a simple majority (218) to vote on articles and formally impeach the president but we are still a ways out from that step, if it does occur. The Senate would then have to vote to convict the president in order to oust him and we're still a ways from that, too.

RED WALL?: “Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned,” our colleague Bob Costa reports, as they “questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of [Trump’s] call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate [Biden].”

Not a good idea: “Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions with The Washington Post that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats,” our colleague writes.

Most Republicans, for now, however are not publicly questioning Trump's actions. But Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) publicly vented their frustrations.

“It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Romney said about the transcript.

Sasse speaks: “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no 'there' there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sasse told reporters after reviewing the complaint. “ … Democrats ought not be using words like ‘impeach’ before they knew anything about the actual substance.”

The Nebraska senator is an interesting case: He is up for reelection next year and faces a primary challenger. But after making waves early in Trump's presidency, Sasse was endorsed by Trump just last week.

The ones to watch: The trio of Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Susan Collins (Maine) are the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents next November, making them among the group of Republicans to watch for potential breaks with the White House. So far though, they and their colleagues are nowhere near that point.

McSally scoffed at the notion of impeachment: She deemed it a “kamikaze mission,” Politico's Burgess Everett reports.

“I should make clear that if there are articles of impeachment I would be a juror, and as a juror I think it’s inappropriate for me to reach conclusions about evidence or to comment on the proceedings in the House,” she told reporters.

Let’s get to the bottom of this.'”

WHY UBER MAY NOT PRIORITIZE YOUR SAFETY FIRST: Investigators say Uber has a three-strike policy for drivers facing complaints, but that executives have overruled their own employees to keep high-performing drivers on the road. In some instances, that has meant overlooking allegations of sexual misconduct. Even when a driver is banned from the app, Uber does not report the behavior to police, its competitors or background check firms, our colleague Greg Bensinger reports in a bombshell story.

A former investigator says what it's really like: “Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Our job is to keep the tone of our conversations with customers and drivers so that Uber is not held liable.”

“Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Uber disputes its policies put the company first, but the story contains a number troubling episodes. ""For instance, a New York-area driver allegedly made three separate sexual advances on riders, said an investigator assigned to the case. After an executive overruled the investigator, the driver was allowed to continue working until a fourth incident, when a rider claimed he raped her,"" our colleague writes. Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police.

Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police. Lyft, in case you were wondering, has faced similar allegations: ""Interviews with Lyft employees indicate that the company also seeks to limit its liability for driver and passenger behavior, in part by deactivating drivers or riders. Earlier this month, 14 women filed suit against Lyft saying they had been sexually assaulted by drivers over the past two years,"" our colleague writes. A spokesman for Lyft said safety is ""fundamental"" to and that it works closely with regulators.

Here's why this matters: ""Many companies go to great lengths to limit their liability,"" our colleague writes. ""But gig economy companies fall in a new category where the question of their liability is still up in the air. There is a different standard of accountability than for the taxi industry, where cab companies generally maintain direct control over the condition and quality of rides and can therefore bear full responsibility for what happens during a fare, according to fleet managers.""

THE KEY

President Trump's apparent embrace of bizarre conspiracy theories involving the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike in his phone call with Ukraine's president is a striking illustration of his doubts about the U.S. intelligence agencies' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic servers in the 2016 presidential election.

In his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump seems to be making reference to strands of conspiracy theories widely spread on right-wing media and conspiracy sites that posit CrowdStrike, which investigated the Democratic National Committee breach, was actually colluding with the DNC to fake the breach — and that a server with evidence of this crime is currently in Ukraine.

Trump muddied the waters even more during a news conference with Zelensky yesterday by saying that 30,000 deleted emails from his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton’s personal server — which was entirely separate from the DNC servers — “could very well” be in Ukraine as well.

Trump’s efforts to enlist a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden that prompted Democratic lawmakers to launch impeachment proceedings. But the fact that Trump is still suggesting there's some sort of frame job in election interference has officials and cybersecurity experts just as irate.

“The fact that the president of the United States, contrary to all evidence from his own government and allied governments, is talking about this now is absurd,” Peter Singer, a cyberwar expert and senior fellow at the New America think tank, told me. “The attribution to Russia was a debate to have in 2016 but based on what we know now it’s inarguable.”

That refusal isn’t just a presidential affront to the U.S. intelligence agencies that agreed Russia interfered in the election to help Trump's campaign: Security officials have long warned that the commander-in-chief's skepticism serves as a wink to Russia and other U.S. adversaries that they can interfere in 2020 and get away with it.

DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa called it “surreal” on Twitter that Trump hadn’t accepted Russia’s role in the DNC breach in a fairly recent private call with a foreign leader.

This is complete nonsense. Trump still hasn't accepted that Russia interfered in our election, and instead, is using a call with a foreign leader to push conspiracy theories. This is surreal. https://t.co/bWwYwXzGhq — Xochitl Hinojosa (@XochitlHinojosa) September 25, 2019

Michael Carpenter, a former top Pentagon official who runs the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, which is named for the former vice president, called it “incredible” that Trump was still trying to “undermine charges of Russia's DNC hacking.”

Incredible. After Zelensky says Ukraine would like to buy more anti-tank missiles, Trump says: ""I would like you to do us a favor though..."" & then talks about how he wants access to a Crowdstrike server. Why? To undermine charges of Russia's DNC hacking? https://t.co/2dfu4gUguy — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) September 25, 2019

Johns Hopkins University cybersecurity professor Thomas Rid noted that ""none of this appears to have any basis in reality.""

“My media monitoring tool has been blowing up!” the Crowdstrike spokesperson said in an email. https://t.co/TT7403M5t3 — Thomas Rid (@RidT) September 25, 2019

Trump’s comments to Zelensky were not verbatim in the rough transcript the White House provided, leaving it unclear precisely what he believes about the DNC breach. They were paraphrased by the note takers and include confusing partial sentences: “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say, Ukraine has it.”

But it's clear he was serious about Ukraine's investigation: “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” he told Zelensky.

As my colleagues Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima reported in an exhaustive accounting of the theory’s many strands, the president is winking at several ideas that are highly implausible or provably false.

The conspiracy theories involving CrowdStrike stem from Breitbart News stories, Reddit threads and from the criminal trial of his friend Roger Stone and show “the shape-shifting nature of misinformation as it moves across media, mixing fact with innuendo before ultimately reaching the president — owner of the world’s loudest megaphone,” Craig, Drew and Ellen report.

Trump's reference to “one of your wealthy people” seems to nod at Dmitri Alperovitch, a Russia-born cybersecurity and national security expert who is a U.S. citizen, who co-founded the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company. The Ukraine connection got legs, however, because Alperovitch “is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a major Washington think tank whose donors include the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire,” my colleagues reported.

And “while it’s true that the FBI did not take custody of the affected servers [from the 2016 hack,] people familiar with FBI hack investigations say the agency often relies on forensic analysis by outside firms, including CrowdStrike, which is among the nation’s most prominent, having handled North Korea’s hack of Sony Pictures in 2014, among others,” my colleagues reported.

“The FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike, according to people familiar with the investigation.”

CrowdStrike said in a statement that it “provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI.”

Here's Johns Hopkins University cybersecurity professor Thomas Rid explaining how it the idea the servers are in Ukraine doesn't make sense:

1) Who claimed that ""Ukraine has the server""? (The claim is wrong and makes no sense.)



btw, evergreen https://t.co/sUNOKIUTQU — Thomas Rid (@RidT) September 25, 2019

Cybersecurity pros meanwhile worried Trump’s comments about Crowdstrike could make it tougher for them to protect high-profile clients without fearing presidential blowback.

In biz, I compete with @CrowdStrike all the time, but I have to say personally, speaking for myself, this is not OK. This is not appropriate, and smacks of totalitarianism, exactly the stuff our forefathers and our veterans fought and died to keep us safe from. — Wayne Anderson (@DigitalSecArch) September 25, 2019

Some of the president’s supporters, meanwhile, jumped on the CrowdStrike comments for another purpose: To undercut Democrats’ impeachment calls by arguing Trump’s real interest was in getting Zelensky to investigate the DNC breach rather than the Biden family’s business connections in Ukraine.

Here’s Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.):

Seeing some political conflation about two sections of the report:



The ""favor"" section of the call is referencing ""crowdstrike,"" or an investigation into election interference. This is NOT the same thing as the Biden section.



Conflating the two is misleading and irresponsible — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) September 25, 2019

And Josh Holmes, former chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.):

Fair point. Clearly the transcript shows crowdstrike is the first order of business and what he’d like them to cooperate with the DOJ to discuss further. Every article reads like the call was intended to ask them to investigate Biden and that’s just not the case. — Josh Holmes (@HolmesJosh) September 25, 2019

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

PINGED: The nation's highest-ranking intelligence official threatened to resign over concerns that the White House would try to force him to withhold information from Congress about a whistleblower complaint against the president, my colleagues Greg Miller, Shane Harris and Karoun Demirjian report.

Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire made the threat to force President Trump to decide whether he was going to assert executive privilege over the complaint, which centers on the late-July call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine, sources told The Post. Democratic lawmakers have criticized Maguire, who took over the top intelligence post last month, for stonewalling their attempts to obtain the complaint.

Whether Trump decides to exert executive privilege before today's hearing remains to be seen.

Maguire denied the reports. “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role,” he said in a statement. “I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”

PATCHED: America's electric grid faces significant cybersecurity risks from Russian and Chinese hackers among other adversaries, according to a new Government Accountability Office report. One culprit for that insecurity is the grid’s increased reliance on Internet-connected devices — which commonly suffer from serious vulnerabilities and have made it far easier for potential hackers to strike, the report says.

The GAO is recommending that the Energy Department develop a cybersecurity strategy to address potential risks to the grid, including from hackable IoT devices and from its reliance on GPS systems, which hackers could disrupt the grid with counterfeit signals. The report also recommends that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission update its cybersecurity standards and investigate the potential risk of a coordinated cyberattack on the United States.

PWNED: Security researchers found the personal data of nearly the entire population of Ecuador exposed online for the second time in little over a week, William Turton, Stephan Kueffner and Nour Al Ali at Bloomberg News report. This week researchers discovered an unsecured server in Germany containing the names, addresses, workplace, family members, phone numbers, vehicle information and emails of nearly 20 million Ecuadoran citizens.

While the data sets from the two compromises appear to be similar, there's no clear connection between them. The first data set belonged to the Ecuadoran company Novaestrat and was hosted in Miami; the new data was traced to a server owned by another Ecuadoran company, DataBook. By Wednesday morning, the website hosting the newly discovered data had been taken offline, Bloomberg reports.

Government officials have asked prosecutors to investigate the potential data breach, Bloomberg reports. The country's Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society is still investigating the earlier breach.

Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.

The White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower’s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Here’s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:

Steven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:

In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump’s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn’t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI’s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel’s legal reasoning.)

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:

When the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He’s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski’s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.

“Senior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to ‘quantify’ the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the ‘best evidence’ to help determine what to do,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. “The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. … They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.”

“All relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Attorney General Bill Barr:

Justice Department officials also said that the attorney general was “generally knowledgeable” of discussions about Engel’s decision but he didn’t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.

Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

She added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.

But Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California’s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.

“Trump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” the AP’s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. “Not only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also … has supported the White House’s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress — in line with the Trump administration’s stance to block Democrats’ efforts to investigate Trump.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone:

Cipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.

Three of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. “He has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,” according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. “The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint … It was unclear whether Maguire’s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.”

Maguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.”

TRUMP’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:

-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor” of New York. “If you could speak to him that would be great,” the president tells Zelensky.

-- “Giuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call … raise new questions about Giuliani’s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president’s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,” John Hudson reports. “Technically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government …

“Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani ‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government’ and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

“In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.

“Through these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. … [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort’s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had ‘colluded’ to defeat [Trump’s] 2016 presidential bid.”

-- The phone call memo followed Trump’s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: “Long before the July 25 call ... Trump’s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine’s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump’s aides that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. … The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about ‘Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign’ and to ‘boost Clinton,’ and asked, ‘where is the investigation?’”

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:

-- Read it for yourself here.

-- “The whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call … But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time … The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump’s interest in investigating his political opponents,” Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.

“The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored … The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...""

-- “The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint … [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,” the Times reports. “Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public … Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had ‘abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,’ the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.”

­-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person’s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.

THE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:

-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Democrats said the evidence was incriminating enough — and easy enough for voters to understand — to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. ‘Strike while the iron’s hot,’ said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. … [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months — though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...

“Multiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.”

-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)

-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: “Throughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. … To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.""

-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. “I don’t get surprised often,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.” (Mike DeBonis has more.)

THE GOP RESPONSE:

-- ""The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,"" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: ""Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...

""On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood — 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.""

-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: “One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a ‘huge mistake’ that the GOP now has to confront and defend — while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump’s conduct and their party’s political standing.""

“Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.

(R-Neb.) told reporters. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was “no quid pro quo,” adding, “while the conversation reported in the memorandum … was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”

“One early divide among Senate Republicans is between the ‘Burr camp’ and the ‘Johnson camp,’ according to two senior GOP aides,"" Costa reports, ""referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr’s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee’s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails while serving as secretary of state.""

-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is “appropriate,” per the AP.

-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: “The White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.""

THE UKRAINE ANGLE:

-- Trump’s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: “‘We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,’ Trump cracked. … Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that ‘it’s better to be on TV than by phone.’ … Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that ‘nobody pushed me’ to investigate. ‘I think you read everything,’ Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. ‘I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved’ in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. ‘No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.’ Trump chimed in: ‘In other words, no pressure.’""

-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a “very good” prosecutor.” But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin “became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors … Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.”

-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn’t Kiev’s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: “Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.”

-- “The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine’s government. We exported our corruption, instead,” laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:

-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: “For years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world’s most notorious hacks. … Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, … CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president’s call].”

The nature of Trump’s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House’s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, “the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.""

-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. … Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing.’ … In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

""Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. … Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of ‘socialism.’”

-- “An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,"" writes Karen Tumulty. ""Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. ‘Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,’ says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.”

-- Trump’s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: “‘This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,’ said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. ‘Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,’ Hughes said. But ‘when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,’ Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, ‘tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,’ said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. ‘He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.’”

-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like “do me a favor.” Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor.” (Mediaite)

-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)

NOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:

-- Tuesday was Pelosi’s day, but Wednesday was Trump’s – for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “The impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.”

-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review’s David French, a leading conservative attorney: “The transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump’s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.”

-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post’s Editorial Board.

-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: “At least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the ‘smoking gun’ tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. … Trump, by contrast, is so clueless — so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong — that he could actually tweet this morning: ‘Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?’”

-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

-- The House doesn’t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump’s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight – just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: “As the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any ‘foreign state’). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.”

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world’s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: “Department of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise — Hernández has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple ‘caravans’ to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].”

-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)

-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)

-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency’s custody. Robert Moore reports: “‘We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,’ Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ‘By the Department of Homeland Security’s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.’ DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.”

-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause “significant delays” in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: “ERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.""

­-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: “The nation’s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau’s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of ‘0’ indicates perfect equality, while a score of ‘1’ indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.”

-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog’s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing’s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: “Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog’s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was ‘not what happened,’ ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was ‘simply not accurate.’”

-- Trump’s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: “The document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at ‘closed’ meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the ‘five star’ status of the US president’s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been ‘newly refurbished.’ Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: “Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.""

-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is ""on the edge of collapse."" From the AP: ""Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.""

-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: “‘It happened under my watch,’ the Saudi leader [said.] ‘I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.’ But he insists that it was without his knowledge. … [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. ‘We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,’ Prince Mohammed responded. … ‘I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible, they have the authority to do that,’ Prince Mohammed said.”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.”

-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was ‘wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.’ Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.”

-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: “In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing … The researchers … found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.”

-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: “China is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing’s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, “pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that ‘it’s not functioning well’ and excludes people who aren’t ‘walking the line.’ ‘That’s just not right,’ McCain said. ‘That’s not the party my husband and I belonged to.’ While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party’s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state’s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized — and vocal — Latino population and transplants from around the country. … ‘I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,’ McCain said. ‘I’m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: “The latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden’s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.""

-- A volunteer for Warren’s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)

-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: “The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. … Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

-- Cory Booker has crossed the halfway threshold to his $1.7 million fundraising goal. His campaign manager said that he needs to raise that much in the final 10 days of September to have a viable path forward, per Yahoo News.

-- Tulsi Gabbard qualified for the fourth Democratic debate after missing out on the third one. The Hawaii Democrat has the support of 2 percent of registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters, according to a Monmouth University poll, per the Columbus Dispatch.

We apologize for the delay.

THE BIG IDEA: If President Trump thought releasing the readout of his call with Ukraine’s president would break impeachment fever on Capitol Hill, he miscalculated.

The five-page summary released this morning intensified Democratic demands to see the entire whistleblower complaint. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said, according to the transcript, after asking for ""a favor."" (Here are seven additional takeaways, via Aaron Blake.)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged fellow party leaders in a private meeting to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, per Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade.

Several Senate Republicans were stunned and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released the rough transcript, Robert Costa reports. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters after reading the transcript.

-- “Senior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred the concerns about the call to the Justice Department, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. The inspector general later also referred the matter to the FBI,” Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report. “Career prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department’s criminal division then reviewed the transcript of the call, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts ‘could not make out and cannot make out’ the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered ‘a thing of value’ under the law.”

-- What was released by the White House is a five-page summary of a 30-minute conversation. That means some of what was covered is likely not even in the memo. The document includes a disclaimer on the first page that it is “not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”

“The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,” it says. “A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.”

Richard Nixon points to edited transcripts of the White House tapes during a nationally televised address on April 29, 1974. (AP)

-- Richard Nixon released a transcript, too. After the revelation that he recorded Oval Office meetings, the then-president refused to turn over the tapes, claiming executive privilege, and fought subpoenas in court. Eventually, trying to quell a political firestorm, he offered transcripts – which he personally edited – and insisted they exonerated him. “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said in April 1974. Months later, when House investigators listened to some of the audio, it turned out there were significant discrepancies and key phrases missing. Ever since Nixon resigned, the White House has, perhaps understandably, generally avoided recording presidential phone calls. That tradition explains why there’s apparently no recording on the American side of Trump’s July conversation.

-- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill made clear even before the summary came out that the summary will not be enough to deter them from moving ahead with the impeachment inquiry. They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power. “There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,” Pelosi said during a live event for the Atlantic. “You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. … I don't think there's a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown and is entitled to legal protections, wants to speak to members of his committee and has formally sought guidance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about how he could do so. “We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted. Lawyers for the whistleblower confirmed this.

-- The Senate passed a resolution last night, by unanimous consent and with no Republican objections, calling for the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required by law. The House plans to vote later today on a resolution condemning the administration’s refusal to provide the complaint. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to sit down with the Ukrainian president later today at the U.N. General Assembly. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify in open session tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee and then in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

-- Pelosi personally informed Trump of her decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in a Tuesday morning phone call. “The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings,” per Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. “The conversation, however, quickly turned to the president’s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions … Trump told Pelosi that he wasn’t the one blocking the complaint. … She responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint.”

-- The New York Times reports that White House and intelligence officials are trying to hash out a plan to release a redacted version of the whistleblower report in a bid to quell calls for impeachment and sow Democratic divisions on the best path forward: “People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report. “The appearance that they were stonewalling Congress, in their view, could prove more damaging than the whistle-blower’s account. Mr. Trump also believes that the allegations about him are not nearly as damning as they have been portrayed and that disclosing them will undercut the impeachment drive, people close to the president said.”

-- A senior administration official told Politico that the White House is “preparing” to give Congress both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report by the end of this week. “The administration official stressed the decision and timing could change over the next few days,” Nancy Cook reports. “The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.”

-- Even though the whistleblower complaint focused on the Trump call with Zelensky, officials familiar with its contents say that it includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. “Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official said. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.” That anonymous quote comes from a story that posted last night by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima.

“Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists … to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev,” they report. “The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain. As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with [Zelensky] out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race …

“U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower … One official — speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity — described the climate as verging on ‘bloodletting.’ … Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. … Trump’s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing. Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Giuliani and Trump …

“Then-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression … But by then his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani’s agenda or authority … Giuliani told The Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward. ‘We had the same visibility as anybody else — watching Giuliani on television,’ a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative.”

-- Giuliani had an outburst on Fox News last night when a fellow panelist was talking over him. “Shut up, moron,” Giuliani shouted on “The Ingraham Angle,” yelling at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn. “Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” (Allyson Chiu)

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS REMAIN OVER IMPEACHMENT:

-- Pelosi’s declaration left unsettled key questions about how that investigation will unfold. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore some of them: “How sweeping will the probe be? How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi’s unilateral pronouncement — which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote — do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance? … The lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe — and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted. …

“[T]he House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s fervently pro-impeachment chairman. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special ‘select’ committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines. … The past two presidential impeachment processes, involving [Nixon] and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now … That is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. …

“Meanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered — one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry … and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by [Mueller], episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic ‘frontliners’ in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. … ‘This should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,’ said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step.

“But Pelosi’s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump’s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump’s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment. ‘I see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,’ said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump’s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry.”

-- Our latest whip count: 198 House Democrats now publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry. That includes 22 of the 24 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifty-seven Democrats endorsed proceedings in a period of 24 hours:

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democrats have crossed the Rubicon, and nobody really knows where it will lead. “I can’t tell you what will come from this. I don’t think anybody can,” said Dan Sena, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “But it is definitely going to be an X-factor going into the 2020 election.” Michael Scherer talked to several other political professionals:

Democratic strategists hope the fact pattern behind Trump’s communications with Ukraine is far more direct and damning than the complex stories of potential obstruction contained in Bob Mueller's report: “This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened.""

“This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened."" GOP strategists hope impeachment would gin up their voters in 2020: “There is nothing that will do more for Republican turnout than this. And the last couple of presidential elections have all been turnout elections,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster working on the Trump reelection effort.

-- A Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from this past Thursday through Monday found that 57 percent of voters believe Trump should not be impeached. John Wagner reports: “Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”

-- This explains why many moderate Democrats still remain cautious. For example, Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) – who picked up a Republican seat in the Kansas City suburbs last year – expressed support for Pelosi’s pronouncement last night but carefully avoided using the word “impeachment” in her statement. (K.C. Star)

-- Biden is mostly alone in the Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry. Speaking in Delaware, the former vice president called on Congress to begin proceedings if the White House continues stalling lawmakers' investigations. ""Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings,"" Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve Wootson Jr. report:

Bernie Sanders would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment come before the Senate, saying he wants to review evidence before making a decision. He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa.

He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa. Elizabeth Warren said proceedings must begin now.

, who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.” Beto O’Rourke called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.”

called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.” Hillary Clinton also changed her mind, saying she’s now in favor of moving toward impeachment of a president she described as a “corrupt human tornado.” “I did not come to that decision easily or quickly,” she said, “but this is an emergency as I see it.”

-- The impeachment debate will effectively freeze the 2020 campaign, predicts ABC News political director Rick Klein: “It would all play out against an inconvenient political timeline, with hearings in the House and a potential trial in the Senate almost certainly extending well into the winter. That's the precise time that campaigning is most intense, with primary voting beginning in February. For the six senators and two sitting House members running for president, that could make for far more time spent at the day job in Washington than anticipated. Long-developed plans for policy rollouts and potential breakout moments could wind up subsumed by the news.""

-- The Trump reelection campaign immediately tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “Emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi­tal­ize on Trump’s army of online donors. ‘The Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,’ read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. ‘President Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.’ … The appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an ‘Official Impeachment Defense Task Force’ made up of ‘only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters,’ with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.”

-- In public, Trumpworld is making the impeachment inquiry look like white noise. But in private, White House aides and allies are starting to feel anxious. Politico reports: “Few in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump’s call … ‘The president’s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,’ said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. … The White House is betting Trump can ride out this ‘outrage du jour,’ as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the … dozens of other threats to his presidency. … But current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego — and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.”

-- The world is reacting warily to the specter of impeachment. Rick Noack and David Crawshaw report: Some experts said it “would have little effect on hot-button issues such as the trade dispute with China or his promises on Brexit, while others predicted that increased domestic pressure would force Trump to seek a quick foreign-policy breakthrough… The developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.”

COMMENTARY:

-- “I’m a Republican. Let’s force the question of impeachment with the GOP,” writes veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy: “In the wake of the president’s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump’s fitness for office. This test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?”

-- “This isn’t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain,” writes columnist David Ignatius: “Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country. … Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are.”

-- “If we legitimize Trump’s behavior, it will be open season on our politics,” writes columnist Robert Kagan: “Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents … Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.”

-- “Republicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump’s standard as proper for future presidents,” writes columnist Dana Milbank.

-- Conservative columnist Max Boot identifies seven reasons why he thinks Trump should be impeached:

He obstructed the administration of justice.

He failed to defend America from foreign election interference.

He attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents.

He failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress.

He conspired with Michael Cohen to conceal alleged extramarital relationships.

He misused his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall.

He retains ownership of a global business empire, which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

-- But Biden sill could wind up being the principal casualty, Pat Buchanan writes, hopefully, in the New Hampshire Union Leader: “Calls are rising for Biden’s son to be called to testify before congressional committees. ... The charges and the countercharges will become what the campaign is all about.""

-- Democrats are upholding a double standard on Ukraine, chimes in conservative columnist Marc Thiessen.

-- Impeaching Trump could hurt the institution of the presidency, worries John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration: “If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.”

-- We should talk about how Ukrainians feel about this, says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, in the Times: “Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign. Ukraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump’s desire to be re-elected at any price.”

-- The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board calls this the Impeachment Congress: “Mr. Trump’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, if that’s what it was, showed bad judgment in our view … But bad judgment is not a crime, and voters may demand more to annul an election only months before they have a chance to render their own judgment about Mr. Trump’s behavior.""

-- Pelosi’s patience on impeachment has paid off, so far, CNN’s Michael Warren writes: “Democrats have now created the appearance that impeachment of Trump is a last resort, not a first resort. She divorced the process from the mess of the Mueller findings. And she allowed those moderate freshmen who built her majority, rather than the divisive members on the left, to lead on the issue.”

-- “Pelosi has to hope for the worst case for Trump,"" writes National Review executive editor Rich Lowry, ""because it’s going to be difficult to climb down from impeachment now.""

-- Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume believes Pelosi has handled this cleverly: “It strikes me that the Speaker and the other leaders are under pressure from the left wing of the party and the leftists in their caucus -- who are numerous -- to move ahead here … I think [she’s] thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it.”

Bijan Rafiekian leaves a court hearing last year in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A judge overturned a jury's verdict convicting Michael Flynn’s former business partner of illegally lobbying for Turkey, saying the evidence against him was “insufficient.” Rachel Weiner reports: “'The verdict was against the heavy weight of the evidence,’ Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in a 39-page opinion tossing Bijan Rafiekian’s convictions. The decision is another blow to efforts by the Justice Department to crack down on unregistered lobbying for foreign governments. … Trenga pointed to the fact that Flynn was not charged or implicated by prosecutors until the eve of trial as ‘particularly telling.’”

-- Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic power broker, and Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman, said they were notified on Monday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had closed the inquiry into work they did that benefited Ukrainian interests. It’s another reflection of the challenges facing prosecutors attempting to more aggressively pursue possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, Tom Hamburger and Matt Zapotosky report: “The decision to drop the investigation came weeks after a federal jury in Washington found former White House counsel Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about his media contacts related to his work for the Ukrainian government. …

""Weber and Podesta were among several lobbyists and lawyers that (Paul) Manafort helped bring aboard as part of an effort to improve the image of the Ukrainian government between 2012 and 2014, according to Mueller’s report. Mueller ultimately referred the case involving the two men to federal prosecutors in New York. ... As the investigation proceeded, Podesta closed his iconic lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, in the fall of 2017. Weber left Mercury, a firm he had helped lead since 2011, in August.”

-- A federal judge rejected former Trump confidant Roger Stone’s request to suppress all evidence gathered through 18 search warrants at his November trial. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Attorneys for Stone had argued that prosecutors illegally relied on unproven assumptions about Russia’s involvement and sought to force them to prove in court the role of Russian operatives in hacks on the Democratic National Committee and [Clinton’s] presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had ‘not come close’ to showing the government misled the magistrates or judges who approved the warrants, that federal agents knowingly or intentionally lied to them or that the warrants were premised on Russia’s role in the hacking.”

Students line up for school lunches at an elementary school in Canton, Miss. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- A new Trump administration proposal to limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps could end free school lunches for about 500,000 American children. Moriah Balingit reports: “The change, proposed over the summer, would cut an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets. But the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.”

-- NASA is trying to land on the moon, and its biggest obstacle might be Congress. Christian Davenport reports: NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is seeking “votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades — the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era. … Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA — as they do lowering crime or boosting national security — getting them to increase the agency’s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.”

-- The administration has granted few waivers to visitors blocked from entering the U.S. by the travel ban Trump imposed days after taking office, with officers arguing that people from five predominantly Muslim countries continue to pose a national security threat. Abigail Haulsohner reports: “Since the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a ‘Muslim ban,’ the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants — 7,679 — have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.”

-- The chief executive of Juul Labs is stepping down amid outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping. From the Times: “The executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Croswaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, the San-Francisco-based company. Juul also said it would end one of its campaigns, ‘Make the Switch,’ which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The company also said it would not fight the Trump administration’s proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.”

-- Massachusetts will place a four-month ban on all sales of vaping products, the toughest state crackdown on e-cigarettes so far. Hannah Knowles reports: “Bans on sales of flavored vaping products took effect this month in New York and Michigan, and the Trump administration said it plans to enact a similar regulation at the federal level. Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine. But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that’s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

-- California health officials called on everyone to stop vaping immediately, per the Los Angeles Times: “‘We are seeing something that we have not seen before,’ said Dr. Charity Dean, California’s acting public health officer, in a statement. ‘There are numerous unknown factors at this time, and due to the uncertainty of the exact cause, it is our recommendation that consumers refrain from vaping until the investigation has concluded.’”

-- House Republicans are seriously considering relaxing term limits for committee chairmen. From Politico: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP’s long-standing rule that allows members to be the top Republican on a committee for only three terms, regardless of whether they serve in the majority or minority. One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker’s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- A new United Nations climate report finds that massive change is already here for the world’s oceans and frozen regions. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Wednesday’s report on the world’s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects only foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked. Given current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Extreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century — around 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries. … More than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report...""

-- A glacier on Mont Blanc could collapse. From the BBC: “About 250,000 cubic metres of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak ... The mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur said global warming was changing the mountain. … The glacier, in the Glarus Alps, has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its original size. Scientists say it has lost at least 80% of its volume just since 2006, a trend accelerated by rising global temperatures.”

-- The Trump administration declared there’s no “international right to abortion” during the U.N. General Assembly, calling on other countries to join a coalition pushing the elimination of what it calls “ambiguous” terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health, from U.N. documents. Ariana Eunjung Cha reports: “Earlier this year, HHS officials began meeting with representatives from other countries, urging them to join a new international coalition that would focus on the value of the family, and which would not condone harmful sexual risks for young people, or promote abortion as a means of family planning.

“Other countries, civil society and women’s rights groups have expressed alarm at the efforts and accused the United States of aligning with countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan with poor human rights records and, also, of putting unfair pressure on poor countries that depend on U.S. aid.""

-- Trump condemned globalism during his address to the General Assembly. Anne Gearan and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump read his address in a somber monotone, rarely punctuating words or pausing for emphasis, but his message for the 74th session of the annual gathering of world leaders was clear as he argued that a view of the world as a global commons had ‘exerted a religious pull over past leaders’ at the expense of their own nations. … In his 37-minute address, Trump stressed that all nations must take care of themselves first while adding that the United States would get involved abroad only when its own interests were threatened. He also used his platform Tuesday to take a hard line against Iran...""

-- Trump also heaped praise on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi during UNGA. At home, Sissi faces mass protests to step down from human rights activists. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside. ‘Demonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,’ he told reporters ... ‘Egypt has a great leader. He’s highly respected; he’s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I’m not worried about that.’ … Trump and Sissi’s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt. People took to the streets in Cairo and elsewhere Friday, chanting, ‘Rise up, fear not, Sissi must go.’ The protests were relatively small but significant because such concerted public displays against Sissi are rare.”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the Amazon isn’t on fire, rejecting calls for foreign intervention. Marina Lopes reports: “The Amazon isn’t in flames, he told [UNGA] in New York, but brimming with riches. And Brazil will decide how to develop it. ‘We are open to explore our potential in a sustainable way, through partnerships that add value,’ Bolsonaro said. It was his first address on the world stage since the worst fires in a decade hit the Amazon this year. In a speech peppered with references to God, socialism and patriotism, he said foreign powers with an eye on Brazil’s natural riches ‘have an interest in keeping indigenous people living like cave men.’”

-- Venezuela’s ex-intelligence chief said he told President Nicolás Maduro about Colombian guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Anthony Faiola reports: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figueroa said he hand-delivered reports including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil. “‘They never took action,’ he said. ‘You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.’ Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. … The classified report ... offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating. “

-- Hong Kong police are waging a war on facts as protests on the island continue. David Crawshaw and Timothy McLaughlin report: “The ‘yellow object’ lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts. As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. … With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city’s institutions and Hong Kong’s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law. Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate. Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ‘officer kicking a yellow object,’ not a man lying on the ground.”

-- As China’s government denounced Mike Pompeo’s criticism of its treatment of Muslims, a newly released video shows about 300 to 400 Uighur men being herded like prisoners at a train station in the country’s Xinjiang province. (CBS News)

Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro, who suggested that Trump’s comments could endanger the lives of the whistleblower and anyone else who aided in the complaint. Trump was also rebuked by some Republicans, including former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who are challenging the president for the GOP nomination, and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.).

In a joint statement, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform Committees argued that Trump’s remarks amounted to “reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress’ impeachment inquiry.”

AD

“We condemn the President’s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,” said the statement from Reps. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). “Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment early Friday.

AD

Trump’s statements came after the House released a nine-page version of the whistleblower’s complaint. According to the complaint and a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, offering assistance from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of a White House sit-down. The call took place after Trump had halted almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

AD

As Democrats speed up their impeachment investigation, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to attack the credibility of the whistleblower and the complaint, highlighting that many of the allegations rely on secondhand information from other U.S. officials.

Thursday’s private event, which was closed to the press, was intended to honor the staff and families of the U.S. delegation, but Trump took it as an opportunity to grouse about his enemies. During his speech, the president again went after Biden, the “crooked” media and the whistleblower’s complaint.

AD

“Basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call,” Trump said of the whistleblower on Thursday. “Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is — sort of like, almost, a spy.”

Then, the president appeared to suggest that the whistleblower and whoever may have supplied the person with information about the Ukraine call had behaved like spies. Trump also mentioned treason, which in the past has been punished by death.

AD

In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Booker said Trump sounded “more like a threatening thug than giving forth the ideals of a statesman” and accused the president of using rhetoric that “gives license to people to do dangerous things.”

AD

“It’s not surprising that Donald Trump doesn’t know the difference between patriotism and treason,” the New Jersey senator said. “If there’s any treasonous actions here, it is coming from the White House.”

Castro, who also appeared on MSNBC, called the president a “dictator.” In Castro’s view, Trump had suggested that the whistleblower “should basically be killed.”

Meanwhile, other presidential candidates took aim at Trump on Twitter, echoing criticisms that his comment constituted a threat.

“This is wrong and this is un-American,” Walsh tweeted about Trump’s attacks on the whistleblower. “And Congressional Republicans say nothing. Shameful. History is watching.”

Several politicians also defended the whistleblower, with some referencing federal laws protecting those who expose wrongdoing. There are specific guidelines for whistleblowers in the intelligence community, who are protected from retaliation so long as they follow proper protocol when submitting complaints.

“This person is not a spy,” Hurd said at an event in Austin on Thursday night, according to the Dallas Morning News. “Let me say that very clearly. This is clearly somebody who knew the consequences of what he or she was doing … and they shared it through the right mechanism.”

In total, the Trump campaign and its backers spent between $346,700 and $1,430,182 on more than 2,000 ads for its Facebook page from Monday to midday Friday, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. She obtained the data through Facebook’s public ad archive, which reports all of its data in ranges, not precise figures. Those ads had been viewed between 13.3 million and 25.3 million times, the NYU analysis found.

On Tuesday and Wednesday alone, the campaign shelled out about $500,000 on Facebook ads, according to figures tallied by ACRONYM, a digital outfit focused on liberal causes. On Wednesday alone it spent about $350,000, an amount it typically spends in a week.

The online offensive offered a window into Trump’s bare-knuckle approach to the coming impeachment battles, as he took the showdown to his favored terrain: the Internet. Already, campaign officials say they have filled their coffers with contributions: Eric Trump, the president’s second son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said Thursday that the campaign had raised $8.5 million in the previous 24 hours.

The Facebook ads, which traffic in claims found to be false by The Washington Post Fact Checker, also provided a new test for the technology giant after it reaffirmed this week it would exempt speech by politicians from fact checking. That exemption, company executives said, also applies to ads, though sponsored posts are required to meet community standards that proscribe threats as well as “content aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive another of money, property, or legal right.”

On Friday, Facebook said none of the ads violated its policies, including those that prohibit dehumanizing speech, though the company did not detail its reasoning. A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

As Trump flooded social media with impeachment-related advertising, would-be challengers competing for the Democratic nomination moved gingerly on the platforms. While it appeared that every one of the hundreds of ads placed by Trump’s campaign since Tuesday used the word “impeachment,” not a single ad placed by Joe Biden, the former vice president, used the word. Biden said this week he would favor impeachment proceedings if the White House tried to thwart congressional oversight activities.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala D. Harris of California, both of whom had previously called for the president’s impeachment, each ran ads on the topic but far fewer than the general fundraising appeals they released that made no mention of the president.

In ads targeting mainly women, Warren asked users to sign a petition calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. Harris asked users, mainly in California, to sign a card thanking Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the speaker of the House, “for showing the leadership the White House lacks by beginning an impeachment inquiry.”

Biden, who became the subject of a July conversation between Trump and the president of Ukraine, placed new ads condemning the president for soliciting help from a foreign leader to smear him. But Biden stopped short of mentioning impeachment.

In addition to the individual candidates, the national party committees produced dueling advertising on the topic, with the Democratic National Committee asking users to donate to show their support for an impeachment inquiry and the Republican National Committee asking users to “stand against impeachment.” The GOP’s ads appeared to target in particular a swath of states in the Midwest, as well as New York, Pennsylvania and Maine.

The RNC said Friday it would join the Trump campaign in spending a total of $10 million across television and digital platforms assailing Democrats for beginning an impeachment inquiry. The campaign will spend $8 million, while the party will kick in another $2 million.

For months, Facebook spending on impeachment has been dominated by Tom Steyer, the investor turned impeachment activist, and his super PAC, Need to Impeach. Warren has been next in line, spending about $34,000 on the issue between Aug. 31 and Sept. 21, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic communications agency.

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

Ben: Over the last few months, Joe Biden has managed to fend off persistent criticism about his record, his handsiness, and his age, among other things, maintaining a consistent lead in Democratic primary polls all the while. But with the explosion of the Trump-Ukraine revelations, he finds himself in the middle of a scandal that’s really about the president’s corruption — but which also makes him an easy target for the right, who claim that he and his son Hunter are the real villains in all this. Meanwhile, in a possibly related development, Elizabeth Warren is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire. Is this whole thing a curse for Biden?

Gabriel: There’s definitely a lot going on here, but first let’s note: Warren’s upward trend has been going on for quite a long time. It’s not like she’s shot up in the polls as Trump has pushed his line on Biden’s “scandal” — which, let’s also be clear, there’s still no evidence to support is a real one. All that said, it’s hard to see how this is a net positive for Biden if it continues to be covered and thought about like it has been so far. His team has made a fairly persuasive case that Trump has been so focused on Biden, including in pushing this Ukraine theory, because he is most worried about him in a general election. That, of course, makes sense: Just look at the preliminary polling that shows Biden beating Trump consistently. This is great for Biden’s central message of electability. However, a lot of the coverage — i.e., the way real voters are consuming this saga — has nonetheless put new scrutiny on Biden’s son, Hunter, in a way that’s hard for Biden to defend, even if the actual substance of Hunter’s work wasn’t illegal, and the specific accusations about Joe Biden, as vice-president, interfering in Ukrainian investigations is unfounded.

But I think it’s instructive to look at how Biden himself is talking about all this. Here he is at a fundraiser in California yesterday: “Now, I know that even though there’s not been one single shred of evidence substantiating any accusation made, and today, the leading prosecutor, the headline in the Washington Post was, the prosecutor in, that they’re trying to convince to say something differently, in, in Ukraine said there’s nothing anybody in my family did wrong or at all. But folks, this isn’t about me. It’s never been about me. It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Health care, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that’s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. So I’m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.”

This was after he recounted the actual big deal here: Trump’s call, and the whistle-blower’s report. So Biden clearly wants to talk about his own family … not at all.

Ben: Right. And he seemed a little bit tentative in his initial response to all this, which is a bit odd, considering the gravity and outrageousness of what the president was trying to do to him.

Gabriel: It’s useful to think of it all in the context of Biden’s whole career and political persona. He is very, very, very protective of his family, understandably, and simultaneously very invested in what he perceives to be his image as a straight shooter. So this is a double whammy.

Again, though, there’s no evidence that the accusations are true. Can’t stress that enough. So it’s understandable that there are a lot of nerves in Democratic circles that analysts/pundits are talking around that fact and immediately jumping to: doesn’t this look bad for Biden? I can’t tell you how many Clinton ‘16 alums have made a complaint like that to me in recent days. Not complaining about Biden’s actions, to be clear, but about how Trump has warped the public discussion around him to drag his opponent down.

Ben: So you’re saying the allegations might be true? #democrathoax

Gabriel: You’ll have to check the transcript memo.

Ben: Yes, it is crazy-making that we’re all aware of the game Trump is playing, and then we have to do this kind of meta-questioning of whether it’s working. I mean, I’m doing that right now. But, as I was saying to our colleague Ed yesterday, logic and fairness and rationality isn’t really the name of the game in politics, especially at the moment.

Gabriel: Well, I think it’s not crazy to assert that Biden’s entire pitch is based on the premise that you’ll be proven wrong about that.

Ben: That rationality is making a comeback?

Gabriel: That reason will prevail.

Ben: It may, but there will still be a dangerously high level of silliness floating around.

Gabriel: All this said, I think there’s a real question about how other Democratic candidates talk about this.

There’s already been some obvious discomfort. Warren was asked if her VP’s son could work abroad like Hunter Biden, and she initially said no, then said she had to check her plan to be sure. Castro has basically just defended Biden and refused to engage. No one has said “this is corrupt!” or agreed with Trump, obviously, but they’re proceeding with immense caution.

Ben: Yeah, it’s a bit like the age issue. Pressing it too overtly is likely to backfire, as Castro recently learned.

Reporting indicates that Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats want to do this impeachment thing pretty quickly. Do you get the sense that the Biden camp is relieved about that fact? That by the time Iowa rolls around, the process might already be over?

Gabriel: It’s very hard to tell, I think they’re still trying to figure it out, just like everyone else. If you’re a leading candidate, though, the prospect of an impeachment proceeding playing out during the primaries is a bit scary, since the politics of the impeachment are completely up in the air. It’s just an unpredictable landscape. That said, obviously Biden’s team doesn’t want “Biden,” “corruption,” “Ukraine,” “investigation” to show up in context-free headlines for the next six months (even if the other words in the headline are “Trump” “impeach,” etc.), but realistically the ongoing impeachment process is likely to move the national focus even further away from the narrow question of Hunter Biden’s work, anyway. Republicans may continue to press on the Biden accusations, but that’s likely the case, no matter how long the impeachment inquiry takes.

Ben: Biden hasn’t been shy about going after Trump directly — his whole early strategy was to paint the president as a sui generis monster, which was in contrast to some of his rivals, who tended not to focus so much on the president (until they saw how well it was working for Biden). Could this episode work to his advantage in that it provides more evidence that Trump simply needs to be thrown out of office, and the one person who can do that is Joe?

Gabriel: That’s what Biden is betting. Look at what his campaign manager said to Politico for a story this morning: “Why are you punching someone? Because you’re afraid of them.” The question is how Biden communicates that to voters without amplifying Trump’s attacks. And, just as importantly, how other candidates counter it without feeding into Trump’s line of argument.

Ben: To return to Warren: Perhaps the clearest sign yet of her threat to Biden is that his campaign is reportedly mulling a wealth tax, cribbing a page from her (and Bernie Sanders’s) playbook. Does this strike you as a sound political strategy?

Gabriel: I mean, he’s been saying over and over at private fundraisers, surrounded by rich people: Don’t expect anything from me, I’m not going to make your lives easier. So no one is going to start thinking of Biden as a crusader against the one percent, obviously, but it may soften some of the criticisms from the left, just a tiny bit. We don’t know what this’ll look like, yet, though. Reports just have his advisers “considering” the move. It’s not like he’s trying to win over the Bernie ‘16 crowd, just to prove he gets it. And FWIW I think the clearest sign of her threat to Biden is her beating him in polling.

Ben: Fair enough.

Gabriel: Going back to how Biden talks about all this, and everyone else responds, for a sec: We may have just gotten a very consequential development. CNN and the Times, who are co-hosting the next debate, just announced that it’ll be one night only. And we know that there are almost certainly going to be 12 candidates onstage, which by definition means candidates will have less time than ever to actually talk, unless the debate is, like, four hours long. There’s no way Trump’s impeachment doesn’t come up pretty prominently, obviously, so we’ll see soon how candidates talk about Biden’s side of this. What do you think would be an effective way for a long shot who needs Biden to falter to answer the question?

Ben: The questionee has become the questioner.

Were I a long-shot candidate, I don’t think my strategy would be to go after Biden directly on this issue. I don’t think it would engender any sympathy from Democratic voters — and this is the sort of thing that’s so thick in the air that it doesn’t need explicating. But perhaps you could get away with some more subtle questioning of Biden’s electability, which is his most powerful argument for the nomination. You could mention that Biden has a lot of baggage (which is true) without directly tying it to impeachment. What do you think?

Gabriel: You could try it, but the last three people to go after Biden in debates, however subtly or overtly, only got very momentary support, if any, out of doing it (Harris, Booker, Castro.) The most effective play in the eyes of voters might be to say exactly what Biden is saying: This is a distraction, and we can’t afford to be distracted. That’s saying something similar without actually saying it. But that’s also admitting Trump has way more power to set the conversation than you probably want to admit."

This is a column about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and why you should or should not prefer the former over the latter. But before digging into that question, I’d like call your attention to something that is too often ignored in the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate: The American left’s bark is louder than its bite.

In recent years, socialists and their left-liberal fellow travelers have accrued an unprecedented degree of influence over our nation’s political discourse. As the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis undermined mainstream economic orthodoxy — and radicalized a generation of overeducated, underemployed journalists and academics — the technocracy’s center of gravity shifted leftward. In 2019, the Democrats’ Establishment think tank is agitating for industry-wide collective bargaining, the mainstream media has adopted a reflexively sympathetic attitude toward striking public-sector workers, and conscious capitalists are giving TED Talks on the evils of neoliberalism.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primaries and Hillary Clinton’s devastating weakness in that year’s general election — and the online left’s success in popularizing its interpretations of both phenomena— persuaded many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to stop worrying and learn to love social democracy. At the first three Democratic debates, the middle-ground position on health care was a public option strong enough to jeopardize the viability of private insurance. On higher education, it was free public college for all children from working-class families. On climate, it was “only” $1.7 trillion in green investments, and a mandate for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But the left’s ideological clout far outstrips its material strength. American socialism is heavy on superstructure, light on base. The current trade-union movement is weak by historic standards, representing a piddling 10.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Independent leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have grown since 2016 but still lack the scale and mass working-class membership that made such entities formidable agents of social change in earlier eras of American history. In the electoral realm, progressive challengers scored a couple notable victories in the 2018 primaries but failed to foment a “tea party of the left.” Outside of low-turnout elections in deep-blue districts, organizations like Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and DSA gave Democratic incumbents little cause for fearing their wrath. And where left insurgents did win open primaries in purple territory, they failed to affirm their theory of change: Nominating economic populists unencumbered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s allergy to class-warfare rhetoric and radical reforms like Medicare for All did not fix what’s the matter with Kansas. Sanders-backed ironworker Randy Bryce did worse in Wisconsin’s 1st District last year than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Single-payer supporter Kara Eastman failed to flip Nebraska’s 2nd. The 2018 elections did not prove the electoral necessity of moderation — Warren acolyte Katie Porter pulled out a tough win in a historically Republican California district; Senator Tammy Baldwin’s calls for abolishing private insurance and putting workers on corporate boards proved compatible with winning reelection in a Trump state — but nor did they prove that Sanders-ism an electoral panacea.

Thus far, the 2020 primary has further undermined the notion that Democratic voters will overwhelmingly support radical change if only the left can get the Establishment’s thumbs off the scale. Joe Biden owes his front-runner status less to his party’s high-dollar donors than its high-propensity voters. Few Democratic pooh-bahs went into 2019 favoring Uncle Joe. Many saw Kamala Harris as Hillary’s heiress apparent, while others were so averse to backing Obama’s senescent wingman that they put their chips on the mayor of South Bend instead. But the people (or a plurality of them, anyway) have preferred Biden. The fact that Warren and Sanders are his chief rivals — rather than Harris and Buttigieg — may reflect the radicalization of some segments of the Democratic electorate. But much of the rank and file evinces little interest in their party’s ideological divides. And a significant portion of Democratic-base voters still espouse a preference for ideological moderation (however hazily defined).

Finally, even if the left were to build enthusiastic majoritarian support for a radical break with “Obamaism” among both Democratic-primary voters and the general public, it might still have difficulty enacting its legislative agenda. Both chambers of Congress overrepresent the most conservative elements in American society. And with its six-year terms and immense incumbency advantages, the Senate largely insulates Democrats in even the bluest states from grassroots pressure (see: Feinstein, Dianne).

The left is too weak to enact Sanders’s or Warren’s big plans. Do either of them have a plan for that?

Much of the time, the Democratic left is content to wage its “Bernie vs. Warren” civil war in a parallel universe free of this context. Sanders supporters comb through the Warren campaign’s every utterance on health care for intimations of agnosticism on single-payer, as though the chief obstacle to Medicare for All in 2021 will be the next Democratic president’s lack of backbone rather than the fact that there are currently 14 votes for Bernie’s bill in Chuck Schumer’s caucus (and none of the Democrats who oppose single-payer had any trouble winning renomination in the 2018 primaries). Meanwhile, progressive intellectuals debate the relative merits of Warren’s left-liberalism and Sanders’s “democratic socialism” as though the central question facing the next Democratic administration will be whether to implement the Meidner plan or settle for Denmark’s model of social democracy.

This isn’t to say that there are no areas where Warren’s and Sanders’s disparate worldviews and personal backgrounds could have real substantive implications. The commander-in-chief has immense discretion over foreign policy, and up to now Sanders appears more interested than Warren in radically reforming the Democratic Party’s approach to geopolitics. The president also has considerable power to shape domestic policy through regulatory appointments and creative interpretations of existing statutory authority — forms of “lawfare” to which Warren may be especially well suited.

Given how far the left is from possessing the power it will need to turn its wildest “green dreams” into reality, however, the most worthwhile Bernie-versus-Warren arguments may concern tactics, not policy. Whether Sanders’s approach to expropriating the billionaire class is preferable to Warren’s isn’t a question that’s likely to be of much practical consequence in the medium-term future. But whether his approach to winning elections — and using his power to build up the left’s — is more viable than Warren’s absolutely is.

In recent days, the staunchly pro-Sanders publication Jacobin has made the latter case, arguing that Sanders’s theory of change is both radically distinct from and superior to Warren’s. Refreshingly, the socialist magazine premises its argument on a frank acknowledgement of the left’s sorry state. In its account, Warren may have been a suitable agent of structural change three decades ago, when the grassroots left was still strong enough to arrange “a tense but functional relationship between a reformist administration in the White House and a strong and organized working class that could at least challenge capital’s imperatives.” But in the current context, the left doesn’t command enough divisions to make use of Warren’s technocratic gifts. It needs foot soldiers, not plans. And Bernie Sanders is uniquely capable of reassembling the left’s army because of his deeper commitment to radical, bottom-up change, his greater appeal to blue-collar constituencies, and his more unabashedly adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party.

I find this unconvincing. But Jacobin’s case merits examination, as it’s focused on the right questions: How do we get from where we are to a polity in which our plans actually matter? And is Warren or Sanders more likely to get us there?

The differences between Sanders and Warren may be smaller than they appear (in Jacobin articles, anyway).

One obstacle to a productive debate over whether Warren or Sanders is a more viable agent of change is the temptation to exaggerate the distinctions between their respective modes of operation. In “Elizabeth Warren’s Strategy Within the Democratic Party Is All Wrong,” Jacobin’s (typically incisive) Branko Marcetic falls prey to that impulse. In his column, Marcetic argues that the Massachusetts senator’s reported outreach to the Democratic Establishment betrays her commitment to an “inside strategy” that is bound to fail. The problem with his argument is that its central premise — that Warren’s decision to court power players in the Democratic Party sharply distinguishes her campaign from Sanders’s — appears to be false.

Marcetic’s essay is based on a New York Times story from last month that reported that, in an apparent bid to ingratiate herself with superdelegates, Warren had told influential Democratic brokers that she wanted to build power within the party and wouldn’t be assembling her own independent grassroots army. Sanders’s supporters responded to this news with (gleeful) indignation, as it appeared to heighten the contradictions between his and her theories of change. And yet, the most significant difference ostensibly established by the Times article — that Warren was forswearing the kind of independent organizing that Sanders champions — wasn’t actually any distinction at all. Oddly, Marcetic concedes this point in a parenthetical but declines to address its implications for his broader argument:

On August 26, the New York Times reported that Warren has been aggressively courting Democratic officials behind the scenes, assuring them, in the paper’s telling, that she is a loyal Democrat and does not plan to create her own political or organizing infrastructure outside the party. (The next day, the Association of State Democratic Committees announced that Sanders and a number of other candidates have, like Warren, pledged not to create “any organizing or messaging infrastructure that is parallel or duplicative” to the DNC or state parties.)

Marcetic proceeds to suggest that, even if Warren’s pledge is not as distinctive as it first appeared, her courting of superdelegates is:

Besides trying to convince Democrats that her progressive ideas won’t make her “unelectable,” Warren’s private assurances that she simply wants to breathe new life into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and help the party recapture Congress, the Times notes, also have a politically strategic element. Thanks to a rule change last year, if no single candidate wins an outright majority of delegates in the primaries — a plausible scenario in this crowded field — the superdelegates will once again have a large role in choosing the nominee, this time on the second ballot. And, should it come down to a second ballot, Warren wants their votes.

It’s unclear how easily these overtures to the DNC will sit with Warren’s plans for major structural change in the United States.

This distinction, too, is nonexistent: In May, a Sanders-campaign aide told BuzzFeed News, “We’re taking superdelegates and superdelegates strategy seriously, hence having a team dedicated to delegates who can prepare for multiple convention scenarios. We will be reaching out to them over the course of the campaign. When the senator wins the nomination, he’s eager to work with them to support and unite all the party in the general and beyond.”

There is nothing especially telling about a candidate’s seeking the approval of powerful figures in the party whose nomination he or she is trying to win. To neglect such “inside” tactics would be political malpractice, as the Sanders campaign readily acknowledges.

Nevertheless, differences between each candidate’s relationship with the Democratic Party persist.

All this said, it is true that, as a general matter, Sanders has a more adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party than Warren. He has, of course, refused to join the party for the duration of his congressional career, and he has used that formal independence to criticize the Democratic Establishment with a (generally righteous) fury that Warren has reserved for financial executives. He has also made some efforts to build an independent political infrastructure capable of challenging incumbent Democrats that refuse to get with his program (though he has apparently promised to suspend those efforts upon winning the nomination).

Given these facts, it isn’t wholly implausible to view the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate as a proxy for a broader dispute over the left’s relationship to the Democratic Party. Namely: Should progressives and socialists seek to co-opt the Democratic brand, build power within its institutions, and seek accommodation with its leadership, out of a recognition that the left is strong enough (and, for now, ideologically fashionable enough) to exert influence as one interest group within the Democrats’ big tent but far too weak to establish an independent political identity capable of capturing the loyalties of the Democratic base? Or is the Democratic brand too toxic with the working class — and its leadership too entrenched and aligned with capital — to be worth co-opting? Which is to say: Is popularizing a socialist identity that can bridge America’s partisan divide and mobilize its nonvoters — while building an independent party-like entity capable of disciplining its candidates and putting the fear of obsolescence into the Democratic leadership — the only path to radical reform?

It is not clear to me that Sanders is personally committed to the latter theory of change (given his aforementioned pledge, and decades of productive cooperation with the Democratic leadership, it seems possible that becoming blue America’s standard-bearer would dispel his reservations about working within the two-party system). But many of his most enthusiastic, socialist supporters are; Jacobin’s editors, and many members of the DSA, proselytize an electoral strategy of building an independent socialist party that competes on the Democratic ballot line when necessary. And even if a President Sanders does not directly participate in that project, the election of a self-avowed socialist would surely abet such efforts more than that of a staunchly pro-market progressive Democrat.

So, for the sake of argument, let’s stipulate that Bernie plans to violate his pledges and brook no compromise with the Democrats’ old regime. What is the evidence for the premise that forswearing all accommodation with the Democratic Party would maximize the left’s gains?

Toward the end of his column, Marcetic gestures at one answer:

An insurgent movement like the Tea Party made heavy use of confrontational tactics and primary challenges to wrench the Republican Party toward its end of the political spectrum. Donald Trump’s antagonistic relationship with a GOP establishment that largely opposed him didn’t stop him from both winning the Republican primary and the general election, and today’s GOP has been refashioned in Trump’s image, with even his fiercest Republican critics now fully signing on to his agenda. Trump did this not by convincing members of the GOP establishment that he was correct, but by rallying voters and making it virtually impossible for Republicans to both keep their jobs and oppose him. If the next Democratic president fails to achieve something similar, they won’t just face an obstructionist Republican bloc, but a host of conservative Democrats who will stand as a barrier to their agenda, just as Obama did in 2009…Only a direct challenge to the power of those elites will enable a progressive president to overcome it.

There are several problems with this analogy. First, it is not clear why pursuing diplomacy with Establishment factions — while seeking control of a party’s apparatus — is incompatible with abetting some primary challenges (Warren’s staff has significant ties to the organization Justice Democrats, which exists to orchestrate such campaigns). Second, Donald Trump absolutely sought reconciliation with the GOP Establishment upon winning his party’s nomination in 2016, noticeably adjusted his platform to suit its wishes, and owed his victory largely to the strength of the RNC’s infrastructure (his own campaign being a ramshackle mess). Third, Trump’s fiercest critics have not actually “fully” signed on to his agenda. In fact, Republican senators have repeatedly rebuffed the president on his signature issue, voting down Trump’s proposed reductions in legal immigration by wide margins. One might therefore interpret Trump as a testament to the limitations of the inside game. But then does anyone really believe that America’s nativists would be exercising more power in our politics had they begrudged Trump his accommodations with the GOP’s corporate wing or attempted to popularize an independent political identity, instead of seeking to claim the Republican Party as their own? And can anyone argue that Trump has been too soft on his intraparty critics?

The lesson of Trump’s failure to rally Republican senators behind his immigration agenda is that it is extremely hard to force a U.S. senator to vote for something he or she strongly opposes — whether through direct challenges or backroom cajoling. Six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and, in many cases, the ability to obstruct all of a president’s other priorities make it very hard for a White House to hold any senator’s feet to the fire. Putting the fear of a credible primary challenge into all 33 of the Democratic senators who’ve withheld their support for Bernie’s health-care bill looks implausible on its face. And given the left’s showing in House races in 2018 (not to mention its sorry efforts at Senate challenges), the task appears even more implausible upon closer examination.

The left’s weakness makes it trivially easy to demonstrate how someone else’s approach to creating radical change will prove inadequate. It is much harder to make a persuasive case for one’s own. Sanders supporters are right that nothing less than a political revolution can make Medicare for All and a Green New Deal realities. But the evidence that Bernie is capable of fomenting such a revolution is limited. On the one hand, Sanders has assembled impressive small-dollar donor armies and volunteer networks. His ascent has undoubtedly abetted DSA’s growth. And he has used his vast email list to recruit reinforcements for various labor actions and protests, thereby demonstrating his commitment to social movements and to non-electoral forms of political contestation.

On the other hand, Sanders has had a national platform for three years now. He has built up an independent organization and traveled the country proselytizing for class struggle. And none of it has been sufficient for his acolytes to dominate Democratic primaries, or to win him a broader base of support for his 2020 run than he had in 2016, or even to keep his approval rating from slipping underwater. Although one can point to some polls showing Sanders with an enviable favorability rating, RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows the public disapproving of the socialist senator by a margin of 46.3 to 43.1 percent. It is possible that Sanders’s popularity and influence will balloon once he attains power. But it’s worth noting that even Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s historic popularity — and the existence of strong labor, socialist, and communist movements — were insufficient to render FDR’s attempted “purge” of anti–New Deal Democrats in the 1938 primaries successful.

In light of these facts, is it not conceivable that a president more closely aligned with the Democratic Party — and less openly hostile to its key power centers — would actually be able to get senators like Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema to swallow marginally more progressive legislation in 2021 than a president with an independent political identity who projected contempt for their wing of the party? Put differently, would such senators feel more inclined to perform their independence from a socialist president who’d deliberately stoked the enmity of centrist Democrats, or a “capitalist to her bones” progressive president who’d nursed Third Wayers’ threatened egos?

I do not want to live in a republic where maximizing the number of Americans with quality health insurance requires buttering up Joe Manchin in back rooms. But are we sure that that isn’t the republic we’ll be living in for the foreseeable future?

To be sure, many of Sanders’s socialist supporters see their project as a generational one. And the incremental benefits of maximizing the left’s clout in the Democratic Party today (with all the distasteful, coalition-solidifying compromises that ostensibly requires) may pale next to the radical possibilities that militancy could open up tomorrow. After all, even if righteous intransigence does not immediately inspire a mobilization capable of cowing centrist Democrats, the struggle could facilitate the recruitment of progressives into the independent, mass-membership socialist party, a development sought by Jacobin. And yet, even if the goal is to maximize the left’s power in 2030, it’s not obvious why building a party-like structure outside of the Democratic tent is a more promising strategy than competing for authority within it.

As Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman has ably explained, American election law treats the two major parties as state institutions and uses discriminatory ballot-access rules to stymie third parties. For this reason, he insists that socialists make peace with competing on the Democratic ballot line, even as they build a “a membership-run organization with its own name, its own logo, its own identity and therefore its own platform, and its own ideology.” And yet the institutionalization of the two major parties, combined with partisan polarization, makes the task of popularizing an alternative, left-wing political identity enormously difficult. The American left will achieve nothing without the backing of the black working class. And while not all African-Americans proudly identify as Democrats, a very hefty percentage of them feel a profound loyalty to the party of civil rights and Barack Obama. And the same is true for many of the left’s other key constituencies. At present, the Democratic Party is an institution that manages to put Latinx housekeepers in Las Vegas in coalition with white industrial laborers in Dearborn, black church ladies in Charleston, and long-winded politics bloggers in Manhattan. The party’s infrastructure is relatively porous on the local level, where even the most formidable Democratic “machines” have proved unable to fend off challenges from charismatic bartenders. And while the party’s base voters have strong partisan identities, many are open to a wide range of definitions of what it means to be a true Democrat in ideological terms; some recent surveys suggest Bernie Sanders is the most popular second choice among Joe Biden backers.

Given these conditions, why isn’t commandeering the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, platform, and considerable social base not a simpler, faster, and more viable path to power than attempting to build an entirely new party and political identity and then hijacking the Democrats’ ballot line — in the ostensible hope that voters who affirmatively choose to register as Democrats will look more favorably on leftist primary challengers who disparage their party than on candidates who claim membership in it?

Proletarians prefer L.L. Bean?

In “Elizabeth Warren Is Thirty Years Too Late,” Connor Kilpatrick and Bhaskar Sunkara do not address this question directly. But their analysis suggests that the existing Democratic coalition is too heavily reliant on affluent voters for the party to serve as an effective vehicle of radical change, and that Bernie’s relative distance from the taint of the Democratic brand and greater affinity for class politics and bottom-up organizing make him uniquely capable of winning back the legions of working-class voters whom Third Way Democrats lost to right-wing populism or political apathy.

Like Marcetic’s piece, Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s draws strong conclusions from limited evidence. The authors observe that Sanders’s support among Democratic-primary voters is markedly less white and more working-class than Warren’s. In fact, many surveys have suggested that Warren owes her viability to overwhelming support among professional-class white liberals — or, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara describe them, “Patagonia Democrats.” This distinction between the class composition of the two progressive candidates’ nascent coalitions has become a popular talking point among Sanders supporters. And it may have some validity. In Vermont, Sanders has regularly outperformed other Democrats with white, non-college-educated voters. It’s plausible that his brand of politics may play better with a critical mass of secular, rural, white swing voters in Wisconsin, and therefore that he would be a stronger general-election candidate than Warren.

But Kilpatrick and Sunkara use this polling data to make a far more sweeping claim. Sanders’s greater appeal with blue-collar Democratic-primary voters doesn’t merely suggest he can improve on Clinton’s margins in Kenosha County, but that he can reorient the polarization of U.S. politics along class lines. In their telling, Warren’s coalition is potentially broad “enough to keep Republicans from the White House but not Congress or state legislatures. It would be yet another coalition that could win but never govern.” Bernie’s working-class coalition, by contrast, would have the numbers and self-interest necessary to force radical change through political institutions that were designed to thwart it.

That America’s low- and middle-income workers do not share a class consciousness or partisan coalition is a genuine constraint on radical economic reform. Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s commitment to overcoming that constraint is commendable. But the fact that Sanders commands the loyalties of a disproportionately working-class 16 percent of the Democratic-primary electorate scarcely qualifies as evidence that his appeal with non-college-educated voters is so powerful it can radically realign American politics. After all, Biden boasts even stronger support among nonwhite and working-class Democrats. Does that mean that nominating Uncle Joe would reassemble the New Deal coalition? Sanders supporters might dismiss the racial and socioeconomic diversity of Biden’s support as a product of mere name recognition. But Warren backers can play that card against Sanders too: In the last week, multiple polls have shown her not only gaining more non-college-educated and non-white support as her campaign rolls on, but actually outperforming Sanders with such voters.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

Regardless, the evidence that no Democratic candidate can drastically change the party’s class composition in the near term is considerable. The movement of non-college-educated white voters to the right — and college-educated white ones to the left — is not an exceptionally American phenomenon. Rather, it has been happening for decades across much of Western Europe. The left attributes this development to center-left parties’ myriad betrayals of their working-class constituencies in the neoliberal era. And that is certainly part of the story. But it is also the case that non-college-educated white voters in the West have, in the aggregate, long evinced a preference for restricted immigration in opinion polls. It’s conceivable that, irrespective of economic policy, the demographic shifts of the past three decades were bound to increase the salience of immigration in partisan politics and thus drive a significant portion of the white working class away from center-left parties with bases in diverse urban centers.

But whatever the origins of this development, there is little evidence that left-wing parties can rapidly reverse it by embracing more robustly class-conscious rhetoric and ambitiously redistributionist economic policies. When Britain’s Labour Party elected a democratic socialist as its leader and campaigned on its most radical manifesto in a generation, it gained a historic number of seats in the 2017 general election — by, among other things, flipping Tory-held districts in the wealthiest parts of London. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the bulk of Sanders-aligned, working-class House candidates in 2018 did not have much more success at winning non-college-educated white voters than did centrist Democrats running in similar districts (Richard Ojeda notwithstanding). None of this means that the left must give up on uniting the bulk of America’s multiethnic working class into a single party. But it does suggest that such a project may require years of patient organizing (and demographic replacement), rather than the nomination of any particular presidential candidate.

If Kilpatrick and Sunkara overestimate Sanders’s capacity to realign American politics, they understate how much the Democratic Party can accomplish with its existing coalition. The U.S. economy does not currently serve the average college-educated voter very well. And most of the marquee items on Sanders’s agenda are in the objective self-interest of virtually all affluent suburbanites. Charles Koch may have little use for free public college, universal health care, more generous Social Security benefits, or child-care subsidies. But the typical upper-middle-class family does. Meanwhile, the indebted and underemployed millennial sons and daughters of the professional middle class are one of the most reliably left-wing constituencies in the country and make up no small percentage of Jacobin’s subscriber base and DSA’s membership. There are limitations on what this coalition can achieve. But in California, the existing Democratic coalition just secured subsidized health care for undocumented immigrants and employment rights for exploited “gig economy” workers, over the furious objections of multibillion-dollar companies. Under Barack Obama, meanwhile, it extended Medicaid to millions of people, likely saving nearly 20,000 working-class Americans from premature deaths. The lamentable shortcomings of Obama’s tenure do not nullify that achievement.

Sunkara and Kilpatrick are right to find no contentment in such marginal gains. But by projecting contempt for one of the voting blocs that made those gains possible — and asserting that the existing Democratic Party can “never govern” — they risk projecting an air of indifference toward such reforms and the working-class people who’ve benefited from them (an indifference that I know neither writer actually feels). Socialists must always guard against the impression that they are more invested in chasing an ideological abstraction than delivering concrete benefits to the exploited classes they claim to champion. As a wise (and/or violently racist and jingoistic) man once said, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” For many Democratic-primary voters, expressions of contempt for the organization that represents their best line of defense against racist, reactionary rule can be deeply alienating. Which points to the most immediate strategic upside of Warren’s “inside strategy”: Polls have repeatedly found that Sanders attracts a relatively high level of disapproval or discomfort among Democratic-primary voters, while Warren boasts an aberrantly low one. This reality, combined with the intensity of elite Democratic opposition to Sanders, invites the question of whether Warren is the only progressive with sufficient breadth of appeal (among Democratic voters and power brokers) to prevent Biden from securing the nomination — in which case Sanders’s theoretical superiority as a general-election candidate or president would be moot. The answer to that question is far from clear, in my view. But it’s hard to see how Sanders can negate its premise without stepping up his “inside game.”

All this may read as an elaborate endorsement of Warren. But I do not intend it as such. That Sanders evinces more interest in radically revising American foreign policy is no small thing. Further, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara note, in a context where the left is materially weak, the personal ideological commitments of elected leaders take on a heightened importance. And there is no question that Bernie Sanders has a more deeply rooted ideological commitment to radical politics than does Elizabeth Warren.

But too many prominent arguments for Sanders’s superiority consist of easily debunked distinctions between the two left-wing candidates or blithely unsubstantiated assertions that Bernie is uniquely capable of fomenting a political revolution and thus of bending the Democratic Establishment and U.S. Senate to his will. The first mode of argument risks alienating undecided liberals and obscuring Sanders’s genuinely distinctive merits. The second threatens to replace rigorous reflection on the obstacles to radical change in the United States with magical thinking — and a much-needed debate over how to overcome those impediments with the recitation of rival dogmas.

Which would be unfortunate. In this country, optimism of the intellect is a luxury that no “Champagne socialist” nor “Patagonia progressive” can afford."

AMITE CITY, La.— The float carrying Gov. John Bel Edwards passed by quickly, and the tossed beads and campaign cups — “Putting Louisiana First” — landed a few feet short of Randy Foulks.

Foulks, the 68-year-old owner of an air conditioning company, likes Edwards. But he wasn't exactly jumping for campaign swag.

“I'm disappointed that he raised taxes when he said he wouldn't,” Foulks said. “I know he's got a big heart for this state. He took the bull by the horns when that storm came through here. But it's the taxes, man. Something's got to be done.”

Edwards, who was elected governor four years ago in a rout, is seeking a second term in a state that has largely moved away from Democrats. He has stayed far away from the party's presidential race, angered local and national Democrats by signing a strict abortion limitation law and expanded Medicaid. But he's in a tight battle for reelection against two Republicans running as allies of President Trump and enemies of a 2016 sales tax hike.

""[People] may not agree with everything that we've done,” Edwards said in an interview. “But you cannot, with any justification, say that Louisiana's not better off. We are running surpluses now, not deficits. We have an uninsured rate that's lower than the national average. Now, who would have thought that would ever be possible in the state of Louisiana?”

Louisiana's Oct. 12 election will test whether a socially conservative Democrat can still get elected in the South — whether it's still possible to excite liberal voters, mollify conservative voters and hold onto a job. With abortion practically off the table, Republicans have attacked Edwards's support for LGBT nondiscrimination laws. With unemployment falling under 5 percent, they credit the president's tax cuts and ask why Edwards can't govern more like Trump.

“We're the only state in the nation that lost jobs in the last 12 months,” said Rep. Ralph Abraham, the leading Republican candidate, in an interview from the sidelines of a Louisiana Tech football game. “He's got to own this stuff.” The congressman, who like Edwards is a military veteran, was there for one of the game's multiple salutes to the troops.

Republicans, who dominate Louisiana's state legislature, always saw Edwards as an accidental governor. He won 56 percent of the vote against Sen. David Vitter; one year later, Hillary Clinton won just 39 percent of the vote in the state. In 2015, Edwards benefited from two factors that disappeared right after the election: the unpopularity of two-term Gov. Bobby Jindal and the candidacy of Vitter. The senator, who had won reelection after admitting to paying for prostitutes (“a serious sin in my past”), was particularly vulnerable to Edwards's character-first campaign.

“The choice for governor couldn't be clearer,” one of Edwards's TV ads declared. “John Bel Edwards, who answered our country's call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute's call, minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers.”

Edwards's two opponents this year, Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, have no such problems. Abraham's campaign has emphasized his work as a family doctor; Republicans call him “Doc” more than they call him “Ralph.”

The wealthy Rispone is running as an outsider, the closest thing state Republicans can get to their own Trump. Rispone has spent millions on ads attacking Edwards over “sanctuary cities” and even a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill; he's also gone after Abraham, dredging up an accusation that he used his salary to buy a plane instead of donating the income to charity. (The attack, previously used by Democrats, ignores that Abraham did give his salary to charity until congressional ethics prevented him from taking income from his medical practice.)

“I'm the grandson of legal immigrants, who worked hard and played by the rules” Rispone says in one of his omnipresent TV spots, drawling the word “legal” for emphasis.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff. Edwards has consistently polled north of 40 percent, with his rivals in the 20s. But Republicans like their chances with either Abraham or Rispone, who have tag-teamed Edwards as a tax hiker who can't be trusted on social issues. The strategy is twofold: hoping that Democrats are less enthused to support an antiabortion governor and firing up the Republican vote by warning of “sanctuary cites,” crime waves and a breakdown of gender norms in the state's schools.

“As a doctor,” Abraham says in one TV spot, “I can assure you there are only two genders.”

Edwards has responded by constantly reminding voters of why their taxes went up at all — Jindal had blown up the state's deficit and Republicans got on board with the tax hike.

“We had already cut higher education deeper than any other state in the nation,” he said. “We'd already raised tuition more than any other state in the nation. People know that. The economy wasn't working.” Edwards has stood behind a gas tax increase that's supported by a plurality of voters but stalled in the legislature. In the first debate, he made a lonely promise not to cut taxes “until we know that we won’t go back into a structural budget deficit.”

Medicaid expansion, which Edwards brought to the state by executive action, hasn't reshaped the race. Republicans have not said outright that they'd reverse it, even as they support a lawsuit led by Republican attorneys general that would rip up the Affordable Care Act. (Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, is simultaneously suing to kill the ACA and promising to protect its most popular components.)

Republicans are not running against Medicaid expansion per se, focusing instead on troubles with how it was implemented and on the theory that it's better to get insurance through private employers than the government.

“Look, I'm a family doctor,” Abraham said. “There are those that need that safety net. We will take care of those people. My beef is that we've got over a hundred million dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we've got over 1,600 people on the Medicaid rolls who are making over $100,000.” Abraham and other Republicans have attacked the implementation of expansion while navigating around the implications: that they would knock Louisianans off the Medicaid rolls.

A bill banning most abortions, which won't go into effect unless courts uphold a similar one in Mississippi, took a toll on the governor's Democratic support. Karen Carter Peterson, the state party chair and a member of the Democrats' legislative minority, even singled him out for criticism. But it also deprived Republicans of an issue, and they've spent the final weeks of the race with a different message to conservatives: Edwards is too lenient on LGBT rights.

Abraham described Edwards as two-faced on abortion — “he has a Planned Parenthood operative as his secretary of health” — but had even more to say about the state conducting a school survey that asked children about their sexual orientation.

“We need to let teachers teach and let the parents be the parents,” Abraham said. “If they want to have that discussion with their children, that's their business. The state should have no role in that agenda of social experimentation.”

Edwards has defended his support for gay rights, arguing that opposition will backfire on his opponents. “Discrimination and prejudice are not Louisiana values,” he said, when asked to respond to Abraham. “I think you have a candidate whose campaign is failing, and he's desperate, and he's trying to go back to some of those social wedge issues that have been used successfully in the past. That is not Louisiana today.”

On Saturday, as Edwards walked around the annual Fried Chicken Festival in New Orleans, his coalition came into view. Chrishelle DuPree, 46, rushed over to get a photo with her governor, even though she'd hated the abortion law.

“Abortion should be a woman's right,” Dupree said. “I totally don't agree with the governor on that. But I won't vote against him because of the abortion law. I was really pissed at first, but he's Catholic, so I understand it, and I can't let get a Republican in office. The hell with that!”

Moments later, the governor took a selfie with Steve Beatty, 64, who'd voted for Edwards in 2015 and then for Trump in 2016.

“I'm a Christian, and I believe every life needs a chance, like the governor,” Beatty explained. “I heard Franklin Graham say the night before the Trump election: You're not voting for Trump, you're voting for conservative values. I feel that way about the governor.”

But Edwards never supported Trump; in the final stretch, Republicans hope for that to make the difference, and point out that no incumbent governor who was forced into a runoff has won it. While Abraham has been massively outspent, his plan to win the runoff was for national attention to swing to Louisiana, and for the president to throw in behind him. Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.

“I want him down here,” Abraham said. “I want him to come down to Louisiana and have one of those MAGA rallies. He's welcome to come as many times as he wants.”

No national Democratic figure would be so welcome in Louisiana. Edwards had cheerfully ignored the party's race for president. Asked about the debate the 2020 candidates were having about Medicare-for-all, he emphasized that the current system was working for Louisiana. Asked about the president, he said he had worked with him plenty.

“I already got more than I can say grace over on my plate,” he said. “He typically doesn't go in the states where he's not going to win, and so I think he would be reluctant to come here. I would remind you that Democrats last year nationwide picked up seven new governorships. And I think the president went to just about all of those states.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care. Apart from an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show and some tart statements, the former vice president has stuck to his previous campaign plan, attacking the administration for undermining the Affordable Care Act.

“Many Republican legislatures and governors are dodging their duties to their constituents by rejecting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion opportunity,” he said in a Thursday morning statement. When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.

“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night. “So I’m not at all surprised I’ve become the object of his affection and attention. The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?

Up to now, the president has been less relevant in primary politics than expected. Liberal activists — from the Sunrise Movement to Moms Demand Action to labor leaders — have been driving the policy conversation; the president has made cameos by attacking “socialism” or amplifying stories that ran in conservative media, rarely reaching Democrats, who tend to tune him out.

But the Ukraine story is taking Democrats to territory that to them feels both terrifyingly familiar and worryingly uncertain. Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him. Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.

“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress. “There were legitimate questions with the way that Hillary Clinton handled her email server. But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story. Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.

That's more than have endorsed any other candidate, but it's a fraction of the support Clinton had at this time in the race; by the time news broke about her use of a private email server, a majority of congressional Democrats had already endorsed her. It was in their interest to defend Clinton, whom they always saw as the likely nominee. They are not as sure what will happen to Biden. Even though they believe him, and not Trump, they have seen the president make stuff up and get away with it.

So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president. At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.

“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said. “Trump will smear whoever the Democratic nominee is, and Democrats must be united in rejecting his tawdry politics of hate, lies and personal attacks.”

“I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,” Sanders said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked whether he had concerns about Hunter Biden. Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment. You guys write very perceptive articles on these things and I’ll let you make that judgment.” One day later, asked whether her own ethics plan would allow the children of vice presidents to take lucrative foreign jobs, Warren said “no,” then admitted that she had to check the plan again. Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.

Democratic voters, meanwhile, don't seem to be moving. At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences. Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack. She’d gotten to know the former vice president years earlier, when he got to know her son, who had an intellectual disability.

“He called my son when he was in the hospital. He invited us to the inauguration,” said Heddens, a longtime state legislator. “It is going to be a nasty, nasty election. But I think most of the electorate, most of the people, are tired of this stuff. And I think Joe, in particular, is in a good position to push back against it.”

But other Democrats, with fresh and painful memories of 2016, were more worried. Janet Wahl, 74, said at the same gathering that one reason she was supporting Warren over Biden was that she wanted “new blood” and hated to see Biden dragged into the fray.

“I feel it's horrible to do to anybody, and it’s horrible to do to him in particular,” Wahl said. “But Joe knew what he was getting into. He stepped up to do this again, and he knew how dirty politics could be.”

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, “Your Choice.” The Indiana Democrat's third Iowa spot conceals a negative message inside a positive one. “If you’re happy with the private insurance you’ve got, my plan would let you stick with it — if you want,” he says. “Now, others say it’s Medicare-for-all, or nothing.” This is the third ad Iowans will have seen from a presidential candidate warning them against Medicare-for-all. A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley). “It takes an entire village of politicians to rig the system,” Steyer says. “That’s why we need term limits; to make Washington work for you.” Term limits are part of Steyer's government change agenda, alongside national ballot measures that would let voters decide major issues; they have not recently been popular with Democratic voters.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (Berkeley IGS, 2,272 likely voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 29% ( 11)

Joe Biden — 20% (-2)

Bernie Sanders — 19% ( 2)

Kamala Harris — 8% (-5)

Pete Buttigieg — 6% (-4)

Beto O'Rourke — 3% (-)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% ( 1)

Cory Booker — 1% (-)

Michael Bennet — 1% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 1% ( 1)

Julián Castro — 1% (-)

Of several recent polls that have shown Elizabeth Warren battling Joe Biden for the lead in their primary, this might be the one with the most Warren-friendly news. The reason: California is the first racially diverse primary state where she has shown strength and where neither of her closest competitors has a dominating lead with nonwhite voters.

Here, Warren leads the field by 18 points among white non-Hispanic voters and by 14 points among Asian Americans. Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent. (Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India, polls at only 5 percent with Asian Americans.)





Would you be excited if this candidate became the Democratic nominee? (Quinnipiac, 561 Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 70%

Joe Biden — 56%

Bernie Sanders — 55%

Kamala Harris — 49%

Pete Buttigieg — 46%

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary. Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.

Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent. By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals. The “excitement” margin among those voters for Biden is just seven points; by a 12-point margin, those voters say they would not be excited about a Sanders nomination.

Julián Castro. He’s turning a weekend in Austin, where the Texas Tribune Festival is being held, into a major homecoming: an appearance at a Latino turnout rally, a stop at a voter turnout bus tour, and a “women for Castro” brunch.

Michael Bennet. He’s also speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, interviewed by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

Amy Klobuchar. She’ll be in Austin over the weekend for the Texas Tribune Festival and the Voto Latino turnout event.

Beto O’Rouke. He’ll round out the Texas Tribune lineup, sitting for a Saturday interview with MSNBC’s Garrett Haake.

John Delaney. He’s making another trip to Iowa, with six weekend stops in six counties in the central part of the state.

Marianne Williamson. She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The race for labor's endorsement. Four years ago, as nearly every major union either endorsed Hillary Clinton's nomination or stayed neutral in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders got a lot of help from California. The Oakland-based National Nurses United got behind Sanders early and spent millions of dollars to support him; the smaller National Union of Health Care Workers, also based there, endorsed him handily.

This year, NNU hasn't made its pick yet, and the NUHW just finished an interactive endorsement process that ended with a split decision: Warren and Sanders. Candidates gave video interviews, then the union's 15,000 members voted online, with ballot space for three choices. Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.

The split endorsement was mostly an embarrassment for Harris, who had won the union's support in her California races. It's also a good look at how the momentum of the race is affecting the endorsement process that most unions have only just begun. No candidate looks like a sure thing for the nomination, as Clinton did four years ago. Sanders, a dream candidate for labor in 2015, has lost ground against his rivals, one of whom (Warren) is equally appealing to some labor organizers. Sanders has made solidarity with workers a key component of his campaign, even using his voter contact list to drive support and attention toward strikes.

Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.

8:29 a.m. Trump calls on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign and “be investigated” for reading a fake transcript of the president’s call with Ukraine at a hearing yesterday. In Trump’s telling, Schiff was “supposedly reading the exact transcribed version” and “GOT CAUGHT.” Schiff, who as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is emerging as a key point person in the impeachment drama, had actually been a bit more nuanced. He introduced the fabulism by calling it “the essence of what the president communicates.” The moment was nonetheless potentially misleading, especially because sound bites are regularly chopped without context on social media.

9:04 a.m. The White House releases a memo headlined, “The swamp is beyond parody, but the American people aren’t laughing.” The argument is that Democrats are spending their time on a “political circus” instead of “real, pressing concerns” such as strong border security, real gun safety, affordable prescription drug prices and a new North American trade deal. “You can’t make this stuff up,” the memo reads.

Harris also addresses a tweet to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, telling him to “instruct State Department staff to preserve any communications involving” Giuliani.

The regular rules for conducting an impeachment trial in the Senate are spelled out in the United States Senate Manual, and they include lots of specificity: When the House delivers the impeachment articles, the senate sergeant at arms must proclaim the following words, “All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against” whoever is being impeached. The chief justice of the United States “shall preside,” and the doors to the chamber “shall be kept open,” unless directed otherwise for deliberation.

3:41 p.m. Trump previews how he hopes the impeachment fight will play out in the 2020 election if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee. He posts a 30-second campaign ad. “Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son’s company,” the narrator says, over ominous music. “But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.” Much of this is misleading. Biden threatened to withhold aid that had been promised to Ukraine if it did not fire the prosecutor; he did not promise to give $1 billion for doing so. The Ukranian prosecutor in question did not have an active investigation of the company where Biden’s son worked at the time. Biden’s son was never a subject of the investigation. The Democrat’s current impeachment investigation focuses on Trump’s specific request to the current Ukrainian president for aid in an investigation of Biden, his political rival. Such details might get lost in a war of sound bites and paid advertising.

4:03 p.m. The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees announce a new subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to the Ukraine investigation that were requested earlier this month and never delivered.

8:26 p.m. More comes out. The Washington Post reports that Trump told two Russian officials in a 2017 Oval Office meeting that he was unconcerned about Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The source of this information is three former officials with knowledge of the matter.

7:40 p.m.: Amodei denies supporting impeachment after comments signaling openness to inquiry

Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) on Friday denied supporting impeachment after signaling openness to an inquiry earlier in the day.

Instead, he said, he agreed with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-Nev.) statement to local media that “we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here.”

“In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,” Amodei said in a statement.

AD

Amodei told reporters on a conference call Friday that he was not yet convinced Trump broke the law but said, “Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

AD

Amodei said he has reviewed the White House readout of the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as the whistleblower complaint, and called the documents “something to discuss.”

“No part of my process will be political,” he said. “If you broke the law, there are consequences for that.”

This is the closest a current House Republican has come to supporting the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a frequent Trump critic who called for the president’s impeachment before he left the GOP on July 4, also supports the impeachment inquiry. Currently all but 11 Democrats in the House support the decision to move forward with the investigation.

Amodei took issue with the reactions to the Nevada Independent’s report that stated, “Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House’s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line.”

AD

“Anyone who reads Mr. [Humberto] Sanchez’s article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out — as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned — is simply, individual fantasy,” Amodei said in his statement Friday evening.

Jon Ralston, the Independent’s editor, tweeted that he was not surprised media “leapt” on the paper’s story and called Amodei’s pushback “hypersensitivity.”

6:35 p.m.: Pelosi tells Democratic colleagues Trump’s actions indicate ‘disregard’ for national security, election integrity and oath of office

The House speaker told Democratic colleagues Friday evening that Trump’s much-scrutinized phone call with Zelensky indicated the president’s “disregard” for national security, the integrity of elections and his oath of office. Facts revealed this week call for an impeachment inquiry, she said.

She pointed to the whistleblower complaint that led to public revelations about the phone call and acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony that the intelligence community’s most important task is protecting the U.S. election system.

“Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” Rep. Mark Amodei told reporters on a conference call, according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

Amodei said he had reviewed the White House readout of the July phone call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, and wasn’t convinced Trump broke the law, but said the documents are “something to discuss.”

AD

“No part of my process will be political,” he said. “If you broke the law, there are consequences for that.”

This is the closest a current House Republican has come to supporting the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a frequent Trump critic who called for the president’s impeachment before he left the GOP on July 4, also supports the impeachment inquiry. Currently all but 11 Democrats support the decision to move forward with the investigation.

5 p.m.: RNC launching massive ad campaign off impeachment inquiry

The Republican National Committee announced Friday it is launching a $10 million effort to run television and online ads targeting vulnerable House Democrats over their stance on launching an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The ads will begin airing Sunday in 25 to 50 House districts, according to RNC officials. They added that the RNC has not purchased a TV ad in eight years.

One TV ad released by the committee attacks Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), who unseated a Republican incumbent in 2018 in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, for siding with “the radicals for endless investigations of President Trump, wasting our tax dollars.”

The RNC has amassed a record-breaking war chest since Trump’s election, with the help of the president’s fundraising prowess.

4:20 p.m.: Top House committees subpoena Secretary of State Pompeo over Ukraine

Leaders of top House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Friday for documents related to their investigation into President Trump and his asking Ukraine to investigate a possible 2020 political opponent.

They also alerted Pompeo in a separate letter that they have scheduled depositions beginning next week with five State Department officials, beginning Tuesday with former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie “Masha” Yovanovitch, whom Trump disparaged during his phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in July.

The letters were signed by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).

“The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,” the chairmen wrote.

Documents requested from Pompeo include a list of any State Department officials involved in the controversial July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president as well as any correspondence since Trump’s inauguration about investigations that refer to Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings — the natural gas company the former vice president’s son worked for, among others.

In addition to Yovanovitch, the chairmen have scheduled hearings with:

● Kurt Volker, U.S. special representative to Ukraine who met with Rudolph W. Giuliani and agreed to connect him with Andrey Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky.

● George Kent, a career Foreign Service officer, is deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, overseeing policy toward Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018.

● T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department counselor who was named in the whistleblower complaint as the State official who listened in on the Trump-Zelensky call.

● Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who Giuliani said he briefed on his conversations with Ukrainians.

3:45 p.m.: Senate Republicans signal they’ll hold a trial if House votes to impeach

If at the end of the impeachment investigation the House votes to impeach President Trump, it will trigger a trial in the Senate to determine whether to convict the president.

Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have been critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to move forward with impeachment, but no one has suggested that the Senate wouldn’t hold a trial.

“If they impeach, it has to be, we have to have a trial,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.)

Asked if it’s possible that the Senate would seek to change the rules to eliminate a trial, Lankford said, “No one I’ve talked to has even implied to me at all, let’s go change the rules so we don’t have to deal with this.”

“I would not support just walking away saying let’s do a rule change so we don’t do this,” he added.

In March, McConnell told NPR that if the House impeached Trump he’d hold a trial in the Senate, but he hasn’t commented on that since Pelosi announced the inquiry on Tuesday.

“If it were to happen, the Senate has no choice,” McConnell said then. “If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into trial.”

When asked if McConnell stands by that, his spokesman Doug Andres said, “I have nothing to add to the Leader’s comments from March.”

3 p.m.: Schiff: ‘It’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead.’

The House Intelligence Committee chairman wouldn’t offer details Friday about next steps for the impeachment inquiry, but he said committee members are going to be busy.

“I don’t want to comment about any specifics, but I can tell you it’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead,” Schiff told reporters. “We’re going to be trying to schedule hearings, witness interviews. We’ll be working on subpoenas and document requests. We’ll be busy.”

If the White House stonewalls, he said, “they’ll just strengthen the case on obstruction.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, suggested a lot of work could get done in the next weeks. “The Speaker’s made it very clear that we are not to let momentum drop in these two weeks,” he said.

Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier (Calif.), another member of the panel, said next steps will include speaking to Rudolph W. Giuliani and the whistleblower as well as other people on the call.

“I think that we are going to want to interview persons that were engaged in what is clearly a scheme. This is not a one-off. This is not just a phone call. This is a scheme that was hatched some time ago, and you can see evidence of it dating back to 2018,” Speier said. “And I want to see us come up with that timeline, because this is a truly corrupt undertaking.”

But Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), asked whether the House will seek other transcripts that could be on the classified server beyond the Ukraine call, said he doesn’t know if that’s necessary for this investigation.

“Assume that if he’s acting shady with a Ukrainian president who was just elected, he’s probably acted shady in the long-standing relationships he’s had with Putin and MBS, particularly over Khashoggi,” Swalwell said, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by his initials. “He said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it. We have him holding the weapon now and it’s a question of whether he is right about who we are as Americans. I think he’s wrong, and I don’t think we need to go interview a thousand witnesses when he’s copped to it.”

2:30 p.m.: House committees request documents on delay of Ukraine military aid

Two powerful committees that oversee the federal budget and spending have requested from the White House a timeline and relevant documents that explain how the United States came to withhold almost $4oo million in military aid to Ukraine.

Central to the committees’ concerns are reports that the Office of Management and Budget was responsible for relaying to the State Department and the Pentagon President Trump’s order to hold back the funds to Ukraine.

“As reports continue to emerge, we have deepening concerns that OMB continues to demonstrate a pattern of impeding agencies’ ability to use their enacted appropriations,” wrote House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), in a joint letter to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and OMB Acting Director Russell Vought.

The Democrats have asked OMB to answer a list of questions, including when the White House first instructed the other agencies to withhold the money, and to provide documentation showing “the factual, legal, and policy bases upon which these actions were taken.”

2:05 p.m.: Senate Democrats involve Trump judicial nominee in Ukraine controversy

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats want one of Trump’s judicial nominees to the federal bench to disclose what he knew about Trump’s call with Zelensky and the subsequent whistleblower complaint.

Steven Menashi, a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, is currently working as White House associate counsel. During his confirmation hearing earlier this month he enraged Democrats and some Republicans by refusing to disclose basic details about his work at the White House.

The 10 Democrats on the panel, led by ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), sent a letter to Menashi on Friday requesting information about any work he’s done related to the Ukraine matter.

“We write to inquire about your knowledge of or involvement with any of the events related to a telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25, 2019, or a whistleblower complaint about that call and efforts to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming 2020 U.S. election,” they wrote.

1:35 p.m.: Schiff highlights statement signed by national security officials

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to highlight the statement signed by more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

“The consensus of national security experts is clear: President Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine endanger America’s security,” Schiff said in his tweet. “By subjugating the national interest to his own political interest, Trump has shown he is incapable and unwilling to fulfill his oath of office.”

12:50 p.m.: White House hopeful Gabbard drops opposition to impeachment inquiry

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), the last of the 2020 Democratic White House hopefuls to oppose an impeachment inquiry, announced a change of position Friday.

“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already divided country,” Gabbard said in a statement. “However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.”

12:30 p.m.: Former senator Flake: ‘not a lot of love for this president’

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) elaborated Friday on his claim a day before that at least 35 Republican senators would vote for Trump’s impeachment if they could do so privately.

“Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons realizes that there’s not a lot of love for the president,” Flake said during an interview with NPR. “There’s a lot of fear of what it means to go against the president.”

Flake made his initial assessment Thursday at the Texas Tribune Festival.

Speaking to NPR, he added that he himself considers impeachment a bad idea.

“I’m not a fan of the president,” Flake said. “I hope that he’s not reelected next year. But I worry that this, in a very divided country, will divide it even further. So I’d rather defeat the president the old-fashioned way, at the ballot box.”

12:15 p.m.: Ukraine lawmakers seek new probes into allegations at ‘epicenter’ of U.S. political battles

Lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch probes into some of the same allegations at the heart of the Trump administration’s dirt-digging efforts, including possibly reopening inquiries into the Ukrainian natural gas firm with connections to Hunter Biden.

The Ukraine push, however, could draw the country deeper into Washington’s whistleblower battles even as its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, tries to tread a careful path with one of its most important allies.

A separate probe by Ukraine also has the potential to add fuel to White House efforts to fire up President Trump’s base and lend legitimacy to his demands for Ukrainian prosecutors to look again at corruption allegations against Hunter Biden, despite no evidence of wrongdoing related to his work in Ukraine.

11:25 a.m.: Trump says all foreign leader calls are endangered

Trump returned to Twitter late Friday morning to argue that Democrats are jeopardizing all calls between U.S. presidents and foreign leaders.

“If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!” he tweeted.

11:15 a.m.: House Intelligence Committee members plan to stay into recess

Members of the House Intelligence Committee said Friday that they plan to work during a scheduled two-week recess and left open the possibility that the panel would hold additional hearings.

“We’re expected to be here over the recess,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told reporters, adding: “There could very well be hearings.”

Speier said Democrats feel a sense of urgency about investigating Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“This is not something we can wait around [for] and contemplate our navels,” she said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), another member of the committee, said he also plans to spend much of the recess in Washington.

“I canceled a bunch of stuff in my district to be here,” he said.

Schiff told multiple media outlets that he plans to move expeditiously to issue subpoenas of officials with knowledge of Trump’s call with Zelensky and to take depositions.

10:30 a.m.: Cruz compares Pelosi TV appearance to a ‘hostage video’

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) likened an MSNBC interview of Pelosi on Friday morning to a “hostage video,” suggesting that she remains opposed to an impeachment inquiry but is responding to liberal lawmakers in her caucus who are “filled with rage.”

“I think Nancy understands that impeachment is a train wreck for the Democrats,” Cruz asserted during an appearance on Fox News. “She has been trying to hold back the hordes. And you know, watching her, it almost reminded me of a hostage video. I think she was blinking SOS.”

During the MSNBC interview, Pelosi said she supported an impeachment inquiry after the facts of the Ukraine call came to light.

“The facts changed the situation, and they cannot be ignored,” she said.

As of midmorning Friday, 222 House Democrats and one independent member had voiced support for at least opening an inquiry into whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

10 a.m.: Oregon congressman accuses Trump of ‘treason’

Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), speaking on the House floor Friday morning, accused Trump of “treason.”

DeFazio referred to remarks Trump made at a private event where the president said the whistleblower’s actions were akin to being a spy or committing treason.

“Let’s see: Russia has invaded the Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his political opponent,” DeFazio said. “He’s jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States. If anybody is committing treason — and I believe that’s an impeachable offense — it’s the president of the United States, Donald Trump.”

The lawmaker presiding over the House reminded DeFazio not to engage in personal attacks against the president in the House chamber.

A little later, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said DeFazio crossed the line and asked that the Democrat be reminded that “such violation won’t be tolerated in the future.”

9:45 a.m.: Trump speculates ‘a leaker or a spy’ fed information to whistleblower

Trump speculated on Twitter on Friday morning that the whistleblower might have received information from “a leaker or spy” or a “partisan operative.” He offered no evidence for his suggestions.

“Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all,” the president tweeted. “In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?”

Earlier Friday, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the whistleblower complaint wasn’t written by the whistleblower.

“Look at the phraseology, the endnotes and the footnotes,” Sekulow said during an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends. “This wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm.”

9:30 a.m.: Trump returns to Twitter, calls Schiff a ‘sick man’

Trump fired off midmorning tweets, once again claiming his conversation with Zelensky was “perfect” and taking aim again at Schiff.

“IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!” Trump said in one tweet written in all capital letters.

Shortly afterward, he renewed his call from earlier Friday for Schiff to resign for what Trump contended was embellishing Trump’s conversation with Zelensky during remarks during a hearing Thursday hearing with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions,” Trump wrote. “He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!”

Following Thursday’s hearing, Schiff explained that his summary of Trump’s call “was meant to be at least part in parody.”

In his midmorning tweets, Trump also declared that, “The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!”

9 a.m. Schiff responds to Trump’s call for his resignation

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday morning to respond to Trump’s call for him to resign for offering an embellished account of Trump’s phone conversation with Zelensky during Thursday’s House Intelligence Committee hearing.

“You engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country. And then you tried to cover it up,” Schiff tweeted. “But you’re right about one thing — your words need no mockery. Your own words and deeds mock themselves. But most importantly here, they endanger our country.”

Schiff said Thursday that his recounting of the Trump-Zelensky call was intended partly as parody, which Schiff said should have been obvious.

8:30 a.m.: New Yorker cover shows Trump and Giuliani killing Uncle Sam

The New Yorker revealed its cover art for next week’s magazine, which depicts Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani as mobsters throwing Uncle Sam off a bridge to his death.

8 a.m.: Pelosi says she prays for Trump, asks that ‘God will illuminate him’

During a morning television appearance, Pelosi said she is praying for Trump and accused Barr of have “gone rogue” in his handling of the fallout from Trump’s call with Zelensky.

In the midst of a discussion about her decision to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, Pelosi said: “I pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong. It’s very problematic.”

At other points during her appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi also accused Trump of “being disloyal to the oath of his office” and having used taxpayer dollars to “shake down” Zelensky.

Pelosi was referring to the fact that Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine at the time of the phone conversation with Zelensky, in which he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens.

Trump has said repeatedly that there was “no quid pro quo.”

During the interview, Pelosi was also highly critical of Barr’s handling of the episode.

Barr’s Justice Department played a central role in holding up the disclosure of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.

As acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday, he consulted the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which overruled the inspector general’s determination that the complaint was of “urgent concern,” a legal threshold that would have required disclosure to Congress within seven days.

“He’s gone rogue,” Pelosi said of Barr, adding: “I think where they’re going is a coverup of the coverup.”

“If by “going rogue” Speaker Pelosi means that the Department of Justice follows the law and long-established procedures, she is correct,” DOJ Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.

7:45 a.m.: Trump calls on Schiff to ‘resign immediately’

Trump on Friday called on Schiff to “immediately resign” following Thursday’s hearing in which the House Intelligence Committee chairman offered an embellished account of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist,” Trump said in a tweet. “He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.”

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam B. Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,” Trump continued. “He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

Schiff explained later in the hearing what he had done.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody,” he said. “The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.”

During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi said she was “so proud of Adam B. Schiff” for his handling of the hearing but did not allude to the episode in question.

7:15 a.m.: Trump takes swipes at the media in morning tweets

Trump took multiple swipes at the media in morning tweets, including complaining about punctuation used in a CNN report that mentioned a derogatory term he used for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

“To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in describing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam B. Schiff,” Trump wrote on Twitter, misspelling describing. “Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!”

Trump in fact used an apostrophe, not a hyphen.

In another tweet, he took issue with a story by Peter Baker of the New York Times and declared that he “should not even be allowed to write about me.”

7 a.m.: White House spokesman decries those who gave information to whistleblower

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley denounced leaks coming from the White House, calling them “dangerous,” and questioned the motives of those who provided information to the whistleblower.

During an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends,” Gidley was asked about Trump’s remarks Thursday morning to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in which he dismissed the complaint against him from the intelligence community whistleblower and suggested that the person’s actions made him or her “close to a spy.”

“He was talking about the people who actually gave the information to the whistleblower,” Gidley claimed.

The whistleblower said the complaint was based on information from more than a half dozen U.S. officials.

Gidley noted that transcripts of previous Trump calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico had also been leaked to the press.

“These leaks are dangerous,” he said, adding that he was not sure why they have happened.

“Do they just want to bolster their own careers or get invited to the cocktail parties here in D. C.?” he asked.

During the same interview, Gidley insisted that no one in the White House is concerned about the revelations in the whistleblower report.

“No one I’ve talked to is concerned at all about this because there is nothing there,” he said. “No one in the White House is concerned about this because the president has done nothing wrong.”

6:45 a.m.: Democrats rip Trump’s ‘threatening’ comments against whistleblower

Someone laughed loudly during the closed-door speech President Trump gave at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday. Other voices spoke in hushed murmurs.

Trump had just demanded to know who provided a whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian president, describing that person as “close to a spy” and adding: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

Trump’s comments, which were included in leaked video obtained by The Washington Post and others, have sparked intense backlash, with top Democrats decrying his words as “threatening” and defending the whistleblower at the center of a new push for impeachment.

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential primary candidate, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “‘Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.’”

6:30 a.m.: Nearly 300 former officials call Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine ‘profound national security concern’

Nearly 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials have signed a statement warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry by Congress to determine “the facts.”

“To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress’ deliberative process,” said the statement, released Friday. “At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.”

The collection of signatures was set in motion by National Security Action, an organization founded and largely populated by officials from the Obama administration to call attention to Trump’s “reckless leadership.”

Many of the signers are former Obama officials. But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Matthew Olsen, head of the Justice Department’s national security division under President George W. Bush and director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Barack Obama.

6 a.m.: ‘Enough is enough with this guy,’ says Sen. Bernie Sanders

Echoing other Democratic White House hopefuls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lambasted Trump during an appearance Thursday night on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” during which he also called the president a “spoiled brat.”

“He’s probably the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said, prompting applause from the studio audience. “I think this Ukrainian business — using national security money designed to protect the people of America and use that as leverage to try to get dirt on a political opponent, and then trying to cover that up — this is an outrage on top of an outrage. And I think this is kind of taking millions of people to say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough with this guy. ’ ”

Sanders went on to say that he doesn’t think Trump “knows the difference between lying and truth-telling.”"

The Investigations

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE: Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before Congress starting at 9 a.m. this morning (in open and closed hearings) about the explosive whistleblower complaint that has triggered a historic impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The nation's top intelligence official will be grilled about his handling of the complaint concerning Trump's interactions with Ukraine and his asking its president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Democrats are expected to press Maguire to cough up details about why the complaint was withheld until yesterday from lawmakers and instead channeled to the Justice Department, where officials determined there was nothing to see there.

What DOJ did: Steven A. Engel, the head of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, argued in a memo “that it was lawful for [Maguire] to refuse to turn the whistleblower complaint over to Congress — a stance that the Trump administration began to back off of as Democrats stepped up talk of potentially impeaching the president,” reported the New York Times's Charlie Savage, Michael Schmidt, and Julian Barnes report.

Per senior Justice officials, Maguire "" … made a criminal referral [to DOJ], passing to the department the inspector general’s concern that campaign finance laws might have been violated,” per The Post's Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett.

Last week : "" … the Justice Department decided there was not enough evidence to proceed with a campaign finance investigation. The decision, senior [DOJ] officials said, was made by Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department’s criminal division. They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision,” per Matt and Devlin.

They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision,” per Matt and Devlin. New line of inquiry: “The intelligence officer who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint,” Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes report.

And: ""The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored,"" report my colleagues Matt, Devlin, Carol D. Leonnig and Shane Harris.

The anti-Corey Lewandowski: Maguire, his peers told Power Up, is expected to be the antithesis of Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who last week turned in a mocking and brash performance on the Hill.

Despite his “acting” title, it's unlikely the acting DNI head will treat the high-stakes appearance as an audition for an audience of one:

“I can't imagine anyone who cares less about that — if he were acting, nominated, or confirmed, he will be the exact same straightforward guy, providing the answers the best he can,” Michael Leitner, the former head of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center director, told Power Up. “It's just an observation having worked with the guy.”

Democrats are expected to hone in on who exactly instructed Maguire to withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress against the urging of intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined the complaint was of “urgent concern.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) accused Maguire of not responding to the complaint in an appropriate or timely manner. But yesterday evening, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees received the complaint in full.

Maguire denied any wrongdoing in a statement released Tuesday:

“In light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,” Maguire said.

“I am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately,” Maguire added. “I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.”

The intelligence community, under attack from a president who has consistently politicized it, will also be watching closely:

“How do you square the talking points distributed from this White House with the reality of what the DNI and the intelligence community has said behind closed doors?,"" a Democratic House source asked Power Up. “Will Maguire note the massive contradiction or protect a president who has pitted the intelligence community against each other?”

“Everyone has seen the talking points from the White House and it's literally lies,” the source added of the talking points the White House accidentally distributed yesterday to Hill Democrats.

“The way Maguire has handled this situation has not endeared him to the people he's working with,” a former intelligence official told us.

Maguire was not Trump's first choice for the position: Trump initially nominated Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) to replace Dan Coats after denying then-deputy director Sue Gordon the job. Trump withdrew Ratcliffe's name, however, after concerns he was too political. Maguire's background mirrors what former peers described as a duty to protect the intelligence community:

“A former Navy SEAL, Maguire retired from the U.S. Navy in 2010 after serving 36 years. He was director of the National Counterterrorism Center before his role in the Trump administration,” CNN's Chandeleis Duster reports.

“… Maguire was viewed as a steady hand by Democrats and Republicans alike when he was named by Mr. Trump in August to be acting director of national intelligence after the president pushed his Senate-confirmed predecessor, Daniel Coats, to step down. The president also pushed out Sue Gordon, a career intelligence official who served as Mr. Coats’s deputy,” the Wall Street Journal's Warren Strobel and Dustin Volz report.

But the extent of the tension between the White House and Maguire over the whistleblower's complaint came to light yesterday: our colleagues Greg Miller, Shane Harris and Karoun Demirjian report that the acting director “threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.”

“The officials said that [Maguire], who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday.”

Maguire and the White House denied the story. However, “other officials said that Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July.”

Bottom line — or not: “How this surfaced and how it is now in the public is really a sideshow,” a source who worked with Maguire previously said. “This is about the president and the constitution now.”

At The White House

NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT: The whistleblower's ""identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint, the people said — adding that the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,"" the Times's Savage, Schmidt, and Barnes first reported.

The whistle-blower ""heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had 'abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,'"" according to a Justice Department memo ""which referred only to a single phone call between Mr. Trump and an unnamed foreign leader.""

On The Hill

🚨 218 MEMBERS: A majority of the House now supports opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to our colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips and Kevin Schaul's definitive list.

The numbers: 217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican).

217 of the 235 House Democrats support an opening an inquiry along with one independent (Rep. Justin Amash, who was formerly a Republican). Watch this: 25 of those members would go as far as voting today to impeach Trump. Remember, it takes a simple majority (218) to vote on articles and formally impeach the president but we are still a ways out from that step, if it does occur. The Senate would then have to vote to convict the president in order to oust him and we're still a ways from that, too.

The Senate would then have to vote to convict the president in order to oust him and we're still a ways from that, too. The one who matters: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after reading the transcript of Trump's call with Ukraine called it “laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.” (Politico has a good piece on McConnell's stance).

RED WALL?: “Several Senate Republicans were privately stunned,” our colleague Bob Costa reports, as they “questioned the White House’s judgment after it released a rough transcript of [Trump’s] call with the Ukraine president that showed Trump offering the help of the U.S. attorney general to investigate [Biden].”

Not a good idea: “Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions with The Washington Post that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats,” our colleague writes.

Most Republicans, for now, however are not publicly questioning Trump's actions. But Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) publicly vented their frustrations.

“It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Romney said about the transcript.

Sasse speaks: “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no 'there' there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sasse told reporters after reviewing the complaint. “ … Democrats ought not be using words like ‘impeach’ before they knew anything about the actual substance.”

The Nebraska senator is an interesting case: He is up for reelection next year and faces a primary challenger. But after making waves early in Trump's presidency, Sasse was endorsed by Trump just last week.

The ones to watch: The trio of Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Susan Collins (Maine) are the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents next November, making them among the group of Republicans to watch for potential breaks with the White House. So far though, they and their colleagues are nowhere near that point.

McSally scoffed at the notion of impeachment: She deemed it a “kamikaze mission,” Politico's Burgess Everett reports.

She deemed it a “kamikaze mission,” Politico's Burgess Everett reports.

“I should make clear that if there are articles of impeachment I would be a juror, and as a juror I think it’s inappropriate for me to reach conclusions about evidence or to comment on the proceedings in the House,” she told reporters.

Let’s get to the bottom of this.'”

WHY UBER MAY NOT PRIORITIZE YOUR SAFETY FIRST: Investigators say Uber has a three-strike policy for drivers facing complaints, but that executives have overruled their own employees to keep high-performing drivers on the road. In some instances, that has meant overlooking allegations of sexual misconduct. Even when a driver is banned from the app, Uber does not report the behavior to police, its competitors or background check firms, our colleague Greg Bensinger reports in a bombshell story.

A former investigator says what it's really like: “Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Our job is to keep the tone of our conversations with customers and drivers so that Uber is not held liable.”

“Investigators are there first to protect Uber; and then next to protect the customer,” Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix, who worked nearly two years for Uber before leaving in November, told our colleague. “ Uber disputes its policies put the company first, but the story contains a number troubling episodes. ""For instance, a New York-area driver allegedly made three separate sexual advances on riders, said an investigator assigned to the case. After an executive overruled the investigator, the driver was allowed to continue working until a fourth incident, when a rider claimed he raped her,"" our colleague writes. Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police.

Uber also argues that its policies are ""survivor-centric"" since it is up to the rider to go to police. Lyft, in case you were wondering, has faced similar allegations: ""Interviews with Lyft employees indicate that the company also seeks to limit its liability for driver and passenger behavior, in part by deactivating drivers or riders. Earlier this month, 14 women filed suit against Lyft saying they had been sexually assaulted by drivers over the past two years,"" our colleague writes. A spokesman for Lyft said safety is ""fundamental"" to and that it works closely with regulators.

Here's why this matters: ""Many companies go to great lengths to limit their liability,"" our colleague writes. ""But gig economy companies fall in a new category where the question of their liability is still up in the air. There is a different standard of accountability than for the taxi industry, where cab companies generally maintain direct control over the condition and quality of rides and can therefore bear full responsibility for what happens during a fare, according to fleet managers.""

What happened: ""President Reuven Rivlin chose him to try to cobble together a coalition, opening the door to a continued shift to the right for Israel and offering a potential political lifeline to Mr. Netanyahu, who faces a looming indictment for corruption.""

""President Reuven Rivlin chose him to try to cobble together a coalition, opening the door to a continued shift to the right for Israel and offering a potential political lifeline to Mr. Netanyahu, who faces a looming indictment for corruption."" Why this may not still not be the end of the story: ""Netanyahu’s path to forming a governing coalition is lined with hazards. He has pledged to include ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions, and that probably will deter potential secular partners,"" our colleagues Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report. ""He also has endorsed sharing power with Blue and White, but Gantz promised during the campaign never to join forces with Likud unless Netanyahu stepped down.""

The gritty supervillain movie, which is the latest installment in the fitful DC cinematic universe, won Best Picture at the Venice Film Festival, capturing a measure of the arti… [+6753 chars]",Know the facts. And wait until you see the movie.,2019-09-27,The Washington Post,How not to let the conversation about ‘Joker’ drive you insane,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/27/how-not-let-conversation-about-joker-drive-you-insane/,"Even by the standards of our present moment, when politics is as often as not conducted through pop culture, these developments presage an unusually contentious pop-culture news cycle. Here are three strategies for getting through the coming conversation without ending up in a mental state that inspires you to don your own clown makeup:

1. Know the facts about movies and real-world violence: One of the reasons the conversation around “Joker” has gotten so heated so quickly is that over and over again, pop culture has been incorrectly cited as an influence in notorious crimes, especially mass killings. By that false logic, “Joker” could be the latest culprit, especially since a growing movement of so-called “involuntarily celibate” men have committed a series of violent crimes. But, as Scott Mendelson writes in Forbes, the logic doesn’t hold up if you examine the real record:

AD

AD

James Holmes didn’t dress up as the Joker nor was he explicitly inspired by Chris Nolan’s Batman sequel when he opened fire during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, 2012. Columbine school shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were not bullied outcasts or members of the “Trench Coat Mafia.” They were not cosplaying as Neo and reenacting “The Matrix”’s climactic office lobby shootout when they shot up their school on April 19, 1999. Even the attack on a subway ticket tooth [sic] employee initially blamed on “Money Train” was unrelated to that Woody Harrelson/Wesley Snipes action-comedy. The thieves who infamously forced robbery victims to drink bleach before shooting them planned to commit a robbery/homicide months prior to watching Magnum Force. There are a few movies over the decades, like “Taxi Driver,” “A Clockwork Orange” and “Natural Born Killers,” which have inspired real-life violence. However, and this is a key distinction, they have mostly inspired the specifics of violent action rather than the violent act itself. Individual pieces of pop culture, be it movies, TV or video games, don’t turn empathetic people into murderers. We know this because the science says as much again, and again and again. Even the rise of violence in PG-13 flicks (as post-Columbine pressures and the allure of worldwide box office glory led Hollywood to nip-n-tuck arguably R-rated genre films like “Taken” and “White House Down” into the PG-13 box) ran parallel with a decrease in violent crime from 1985 to 2015.

If solving mass violence was simply a matter of not releasing anything edgier than “Bambi” in theaters, our political debates might be simpler, though our pop culture would definitely be duller. (And really, have you seen “Bambi” lately? Youthful trauma for days.) It’s not, though! Keeping the facts in mind, both when it comes to pop culture we’re inclined to support and that we’re inclined to disdain, will keep our conversations at a more manageable temperature — and will make a small contribution toward keep our policy debates focused where they belong.

2. Remember that Phillips isn’t wrong — outrage is a commodity: There are definitely times it’s worth getting angry about popular culture. But, as Phillips said in a controversial interview with the Wrap, it’s something that can be monetized. For all that he’s using criticism of “Joker” to cast himself as a misunderstood victim, it’s also obviously the case that Phillips and Warner Brothers can benefit from being seen as martyrs to free speech and artistic integrity. It may be a niche play, though with a reported $55 million budget, “Joker” can afford to appeal to a narrower, more passionate audience than a behemoth like “Avengers: Infinity War,” which may have cost more than eight times as much to make and advertise.

Not all the press about “Joker” in the run-up to its release has been positive. But all of it is essentially free, and the sheer volume of discussion and the stakes of the pre-movie warnings have all positioned it as an Important Artistic Event. None of this means that if you truly hate “Joker” or think it’s dangerous — or if you think it’s a landmark work of cinema — you shouldn’t make your case. Just remember that there’s a difference between building an argument and signing on to do unpaid work for a studio’s publicity department. You’re under no obligation to do the latter.

AD

AD

3. And most of all, make up your mind after you’ve seen the movie — or be clear, but qualified, about why you’ve decided not to go: I know this seems like putting the cart before the horse in an environment where cultural consumption is considered a moral and political act. By that logic, you have to figure out how you feel about a book, movie, television show or album before you can decide whether it’s okay to spend money on it.

But while I think it’s perfectly legitimate to decide that you simply don’t want to watch, read or listen to something, and while it can be revealing and interesting to explain why you’ve made that decision, it is also true that you absolutely cannot speak authoritatively about the content and execution of something you’ve decided not to consume. You simply can’t do it. The power of culture comes from the fact that it can be elliptical and indirect, that it does work that can’t be captured by a literal description. It’s factually accurate to say that that “Little Women” is a novel about four girls during and after the Civil War, but that brief description does nothing to capture the work’s appeal and lasting power, just as describing “Pain and Gain” as a Michael Bay movie about criminal bodybuilders can’t come close to communicating the movie’s strange auteur qualities.

So if you want to have an opinion about “Joker,” at least let it be your own. Buy a ticket and donate the equivalent of the purchase price to a cause or charity of your choice if your conscience is troubled about it. Consider the performances, the script, the framing of the shots and anything else that helps you determine what you think the movie is trying to say, and what it succeeds in getting across. You’ll be able to talk about “Joker” from a position of real information. And you’ll be able to judge what everyone else — including me, after I see it next week — is saying about “Joker,” too.

Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage.

AD

On Aug. 12, he delivered his document — a nine-page version of which was made public on Thursday — to the intelligence community’s inspector general, triggering an almost immediate clash between the executive branch and Congress.

Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment.

“In the course of my official duties,” the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that “the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

AD

The file goes on to bolster that contention with specific language that matches the since-

released White House summary of Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president and points to other potential witnesses and grave allegations.

AD

Perhaps the most explosive is the document’s assertion that White House officials used a classified computer system to hide documents that might be politically damaging to the president.

Among them, the complaint says, was the rough transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged his foreign counterpart to mount investigations that would potentially deliver damaging information about Biden and his family.

AD

The detailed notes of that call released this week show that the whistleblower’s depictions — having neither heard the conversation nor seen the transcript — were eerily accurate. The contents of the call alone were widely regarded as politically damaging to the president.

The whistleblower report raises troubling new allegations about the call, saying that White House officials quickly moved it from a widely shared internal computer network to one reserved for “codeword-level” records about CIA covert-action programs or other highly classified material.

AD

If true, that could implicate those who directed the relocation of the files and serve as evidence of their motivation: concealing presidential conduct they understood to be problematic and potentially illegal.

AD

A paragraph in the appendix asserts this was not an isolated incident.

“According to multiple White House officials I spoke with,” the document says, White House lawyers had on other occasions used the “codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information.”

Trump, speaking at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, disparaged the author of the report, saying that he was “almost a spy” and potentially guilty of “treason.”

Attacking his accusers is one of Trump’s standard tactics when thrown on the defensive. He repeatedly accused Mueller and other investigators on the Russia inquiry of being dishonest, beholden to Democrats and engaged in a politically motivated “witch hunt.”

AD

AD

Significant differences between the Russia investigation and the whistleblower complaint, however, may make it more difficult for Trump to rely on such tactics. Among them are the accuser’s anonymity, the existence of a transcript that many regard as formidable proof of the underlying allegation and the speed with which the complaint has already transformed the political landscape in Washington.

“He’ll be remembered as a truth-seeker,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. If and when his identity is revealed, “it’ll be one of those names in the history books and around forever, like Daniel Ellsberg,” who was responsible for the release of the Pentagon Papers.

Trump has all but called for the whistleblower and those who assisted him to be unmasked, despite federal laws designed to protect identities and prevent reprisals in such cases.

AD

AD

“I want to know who’s the person who gave the whistleblower . . . the information,” the president said Thursday.

Other officials have said they are intentionally not seeking information about his identity. Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, testified Thursday that he does not know who wrote the document. A Justice Department file related to the case noted that the inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant,” but Maguire said he did not question the whistleblower’s motivations.

“I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” he said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

AD

Although his name has not been disclosed, aspects of his background have emerged. He works for the CIA, an affiliation first reported by the New York Times on Thursday, according to current and former officials familiar with his identity and position in the intelligence community.

AD

U.S. officials and an attorney for the whistleblower have asked news organizations to refrain from releasing details about him, citing concerns for his privacy and safety.

In the complaint, the whistleblower describes receiving troubling reports about the Trump administration’s approach with Ukraine from “more than half a dozen U.S. officials” over four months.

But the document suggests that it was only after learning about the nature of Trump’s call July 25 with Zelensky that the whistleblower went from sharing colleagues’ concerns to being convinced that he needed to document and report them.

AD

An approximate transcript released by the White House shows Trump prodding Zelensky to direct his government’s investigative bodies to turn their attention to alleged corruption by an energy company for which Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, had served as a board member.

AD

Trump has alleged that the elder Biden used his influence to shut down a corruption investigation targeting the company. The claim has been repeatedly discredited, and there is no credible public allegation that Hunter Biden was guilty of wrongdoing.

Trump also urged Zelensky to “meet or speak with” Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to redouble Ukraine’s efforts to seek damaging material tied to Biden.

“Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the president used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests,” the whistleblower report says.

The document also cites other developments that allegedly troubled White House officials, including the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May after a campaign by right-wing media entities to discredit her.

AD

Although the report does not describe explicit coordination between the whistleblower and White House officials, it depicts an arrangement in which he so routinely received communications of concern from White House officials that it raises the question of whether they knew he intended to file a whistleblower complaint.

The report refers to a “discussion ongoing” between those troubled by the call and White House lawyers, indicating administration attorneys were aware of internal concerns about Trump’s conduct before the whistleblower complaint surfaced.

The report lays out investigative leads for Congress or other authorities. It notes that there were “approximately a dozen White House officials who listened to the call” and identifies a State Department official — referred to with conspicuous formality as “Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl” — as another participant.

Brechbuhl had joined the State Department only in May, as an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Beyond his sourcing at the White House, the whistleblower has remarkable insight into the activities of U.S. diplomats and Ukrainian officials. The report notes that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, arrived in Kiev the day after Trump’s call and proceeded to advise officials there on how to “navigate” the demands of the American president.

The document also traces Giuliani’s extensive intervention in U.S.-Ukraine affairs, including a meeting in Madrid with one of Zelensky’s senior advisers. The Madrid trip was described as a “direct follow-up” to the Trump-Zelensky call, for a fuller discussion of the “cases” mentioned in the two leaders’ discussion.

At its core, the complaint makes the case that Trump was withholding items that Ukraine desperately wanted — including hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and an invitation to the White House — to use as leverage.

The Trump administration had been sending those signals since Zelensky’s inauguration on May 20. American officials who traveled to Kiev to attend the ceremony “made clear” to the Ukrainians that Trump would not meet the new leader until he saw how Zelensky “chose to act,” according to the document. Any meeting or phone call would hinge on the Ukrainian president’s willingness to “play ball” with his American counterpart, the whistleblower wrote."

THE KEY

President Trump's apparent embrace of bizarre conspiracy theories involving the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike in his phone call with Ukraine's president is a striking illustration of his doubts about the U.S. intelligence agencies' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic servers in the 2016 presidential election.

In his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump seems to be making reference to strands of conspiracy theories widely spread on right-wing media and conspiracy sites that posit CrowdStrike, which investigated the Democratic National Committee breach, was actually colluding with the DNC to fake the breach — and that a server with evidence of this crime is currently in Ukraine.

Trump muddied the waters even more during a news conference with Zelensky yesterday by saying that 30,000 deleted emails from his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton’s personal server — which was entirely separate from the DNC servers — “could very well” be in Ukraine as well.

Trump’s efforts to enlist a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden that prompted Democratic lawmakers to launch impeachment proceedings. But the fact that Trump is still suggesting there's some sort of frame job in election interference has officials and cybersecurity experts just as irate.

“The fact that the president of the United States, contrary to all evidence from his own government and allied governments, is talking about this now is absurd,” Peter Singer, a cyberwar expert and senior fellow at the New America think tank, told me. “The attribution to Russia was a debate to have in 2016 but based on what we know now it’s inarguable.”

That refusal isn’t just a presidential affront to the U.S. intelligence agencies that agreed Russia interfered in the election to help Trump's campaign: Security officials have long warned that the commander-in-chief's skepticism serves as a wink to Russia and other U.S. adversaries that they can interfere in 2020 and get away with it.

DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa called it “surreal” on Twitter that Trump hadn’t accepted Russia’s role in the DNC breach in a fairly recent private call with a foreign leader.

This is complete nonsense. Trump still hasn't accepted that Russia interfered in our election, and instead, is using a call with a foreign leader to push conspiracy theories. This is surreal. https://t.co/bWwYwXzGhq — Xochitl Hinojosa (@XochitlHinojosa) September 25, 2019

Michael Carpenter, a former top Pentagon official who runs the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, which is named for the former vice president, called it “incredible” that Trump was still trying to “undermine charges of Russia's DNC hacking.”

Incredible. After Zelensky says Ukraine would like to buy more anti-tank missiles, Trump says: ""I would like you to do us a favor though..."" & then talks about how he wants access to a Crowdstrike server. Why? To undermine charges of Russia's DNC hacking? https://t.co/2dfu4gUguy — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) September 25, 2019

Johns Hopkins University cybersecurity professor Thomas Rid noted that ""none of this appears to have any basis in reality.""

“My media monitoring tool has been blowing up!” the Crowdstrike spokesperson said in an email. https://t.co/TT7403M5t3 — Thomas Rid (@RidT) September 25, 2019

Trump’s comments to Zelensky were not verbatim in the rough transcript the White House provided, leaving it unclear precisely what he believes about the DNC breach. They were paraphrased by the note takers and include confusing partial sentences: “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say, Ukraine has it.”

But it's clear he was serious about Ukraine's investigation: “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” he told Zelensky.

As my colleagues Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima reported in an exhaustive accounting of the theory’s many strands, the president is winking at several ideas that are highly implausible or provably false.

The conspiracy theories involving CrowdStrike stem from Breitbart News stories, Reddit threads and from the criminal trial of his friend Roger Stone and show “the shape-shifting nature of misinformation as it moves across media, mixing fact with innuendo before ultimately reaching the president — owner of the world’s loudest megaphone,” Craig, Drew and Ellen report.

Trump's reference to “one of your wealthy people” seems to nod at Dmitri Alperovitch, a Russia-born cybersecurity and national security expert who is a U.S. citizen, who co-founded the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company. The Ukraine connection got legs, however, because Alperovitch “is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a major Washington think tank whose donors include the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire,” my colleagues reported.

And “while it’s true that the FBI did not take custody of the affected servers [from the 2016 hack,] people familiar with FBI hack investigations say the agency often relies on forensic analysis by outside firms, including CrowdStrike, which is among the nation’s most prominent, having handled North Korea’s hack of Sony Pictures in 2014, among others,” my colleagues reported.

“The FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike, according to people familiar with the investigation.”

CrowdStrike said in a statement that it “provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI.”

Here's Johns Hopkins University cybersecurity professor Thomas Rid explaining how it the idea the servers are in Ukraine doesn't make sense:

1) Who claimed that ""Ukraine has the server""? (The claim is wrong and makes no sense.)

Cybersecurity pros meanwhile worried Trump’s comments about Crowdstrike could make it tougher for them to protect high-profile clients without fearing presidential blowback.

Here’s Andrew van der Stock, a consultant with the security firm Synopsys and Wayne Anderson, a security architect at the anti-virus firm McAfee:

In biz, I compete with @CrowdStrike all the time, but I have to say personally, speaking for myself, this is not OK. This is not appropriate, and smacks of totalitarianism, exactly the stuff our forefathers and our veterans fought and died to keep us safe from. — Wayne Anderson (@DigitalSecArch) September 25, 2019

Some of the president’s supporters, meanwhile, jumped on the CrowdStrike comments for another purpose: To undercut Democrats’ impeachment calls by arguing Trump’s real interest was in getting Zelensky to investigate the DNC breach rather than the Biden family’s business connections in Ukraine.

Here’s Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.):

Seeing some political conflation about two sections of the report:



The ""favor"" section of the call is referencing ""crowdstrike,"" or an investigation into election interference. This is NOT the same thing as the Biden section.



Conflating the two is misleading and irresponsible — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) September 25, 2019

And Josh Holmes, former chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.):

Fair point. Clearly the transcript shows crowdstrike is the first order of business and what he’d like them to cooperate with the DOJ to discuss further. Every article reads like the call was intended to ask them to investigate Biden and that’s just not the case. — Josh Holmes (@HolmesJosh) September 25, 2019

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

PINGED: The nation's highest-ranking intelligence official threatened to resign over concerns that the White House would try to force him to withhold information from Congress about a whistleblower complaint against the president, my colleagues Greg Miller, Shane Harris and Karoun Demirjian report.

Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire made the threat to force President Trump to decide whether he was going to assert executive privilege over the complaint, which centers on the late-July call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine, sources told The Post. Democratic lawmakers have criticized Maguire, who took over the top intelligence post last month, for stonewalling their attempts to obtain the complaint.

Whether Trump decides to exert executive privilege before today's hearing remains to be seen.

Maguire denied the reports. “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role,” he said in a statement. “I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”

PATCHED: America's electric grid faces significant cybersecurity risks from Russian and Chinese hackers among other adversaries, according to a new Government Accountability Office report. One culprit for that insecurity is the grid’s increased reliance on Internet-connected devices — which commonly suffer from serious vulnerabilities and have made it far easier for potential hackers to strike, the report says.

The GAO is recommending that the Energy Department develop a cybersecurity strategy to address potential risks to the grid, including from hackable IoT devices and from its reliance on GPS systems, which hackers could disrupt the grid with counterfeit signals. The report also recommends that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission update its cybersecurity standards and investigate the potential risk of a coordinated cyberattack on the United States.

PWNED: Security researchers found the personal data of nearly the entire population of Ecuador exposed online for the second time in little over a week, William Turton, Stephan Kueffner and Nour Al Ali at Bloomberg News report. This week researchers discovered an unsecured server in Germany containing the names, addresses, workplace, family members, phone numbers, vehicle information and emails of nearly 20 million Ecuadoran citizens.

While the data sets from the two compromises appear to be similar, there's no clear connection between them. The first data set belonged to the Ecuadoran company Novaestrat and was hosted in Miami; the new data was traced to a server owned by another Ecuadoran company, DataBook. By Wednesday morning, the website hosting the newly discovered data had been taken offline, Bloomberg reports.

Government officials have asked prosecutors to investigate the potential data breach, Bloomberg reports. The country's Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society is still investigating the earlier breach.

Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.

The White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower’s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Here’s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:

Steven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:

In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump’s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn’t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI’s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel’s legal reasoning.)

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:

When the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He’s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski’s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.

“Senior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to ‘quantify’ the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the ‘best evidence’ to help determine what to do,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. “The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. … They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.”

“All relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Attorney General Bill Barr:

Justice Department officials also said that the attorney general was “generally knowledgeable” of discussions about Engel’s decision but he didn’t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.

Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

She added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.

But Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California’s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.

“Trump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” the AP’s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. “Not only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also … has supported the White House’s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress — in line with the Trump administration’s stance to block Democrats’ efforts to investigate Trump.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone:

Cipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.

Three of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. “He has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,” according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. “The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint … It was unclear whether Maguire’s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.”

Maguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.”

TRUMP’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:

-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor” of New York. “If you could speak to him that would be great,” the president tells Zelensky.

-- “Giuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call … raise new questions about Giuliani’s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president’s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,” John Hudson reports. “Technically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government …

“Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani ‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government’ and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

“In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.

“Through these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. … [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort’s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had ‘colluded’ to defeat [Trump’s] 2016 presidential bid.”

-- The phone call memo followed Trump’s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: “Long before the July 25 call ... Trump’s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine’s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump’s aides that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. … The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about ‘Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign’ and to ‘boost Clinton,’ and asked, ‘where is the investigation?’”

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:

-- Read it for yourself here.

-- “The whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call … But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time … The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump’s interest in investigating his political opponents,” Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.

“The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored … The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...""

-- “The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint … [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,” the Times reports. “Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public … Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had ‘abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,’ the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.”

­-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person’s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.

THE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:

-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Democrats said the evidence was incriminating enough — and easy enough for voters to understand — to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. ‘Strike while the iron’s hot,’ said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. … [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months — though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...

“Multiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.”

-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)

-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: “Throughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. … To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.""

-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. “I don’t get surprised often,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.” (Mike DeBonis has more.)

THE GOP RESPONSE:

-- ""The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,"" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: ""Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...

""On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood — 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.""

-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: “One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a ‘huge mistake’ that the GOP now has to confront and defend — while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump’s conduct and their party’s political standing.""

“Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.

(R-Neb.) told reporters. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was “no quid pro quo,” adding, “while the conversation reported in the memorandum … was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”

“One early divide among Senate Republicans is between the ‘Burr camp’ and the ‘Johnson camp,’ according to two senior GOP aides,"" Costa reports, ""referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr’s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee’s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails while serving as secretary of state.""

-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is “appropriate,” per the AP.

-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: “The White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.""

THE UKRAINE ANGLE:

-- Trump’s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: “‘We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,’ Trump cracked. … Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that ‘it’s better to be on TV than by phone.’ … Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that ‘nobody pushed me’ to investigate. ‘I think you read everything,’ Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. ‘I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved’ in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. ‘No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.’ Trump chimed in: ‘In other words, no pressure.’""

-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a “very good” prosecutor.” But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin “became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors … Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.”

-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn’t Kiev’s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: “Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.”

-- “The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine’s government. We exported our corruption, instead,” laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:

-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: “For years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world’s most notorious hacks. … Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, … CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president’s call].”

The nature of Trump’s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House’s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, “the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.""

-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. … Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing.’ … In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

""Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. … Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of ‘socialism.’”

-- “An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,"" writes Karen Tumulty. ""Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. ‘Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,’ says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.”

-- Trump’s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: “‘This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,’ said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. ‘Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,’ Hughes said. But ‘when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,’ Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, ‘tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,’ said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. ‘He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.’”

-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like “do me a favor.” Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor.” (Mediaite)

-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)

NOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:

-- Tuesday was Pelosi’s day, but Wednesday was Trump’s – for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “The impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.”

-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review’s David French, a leading conservative attorney: “The transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump’s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.”

-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post’s Editorial Board.

-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: “At least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the ‘smoking gun’ tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. … Trump, by contrast, is so clueless — so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong — that he could actually tweet this morning: ‘Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?’”

-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

-- The House doesn’t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump’s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight – just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: “As the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any ‘foreign state’). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.”

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world’s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: “Department of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise — Hernández has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple ‘caravans’ to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].”

-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)

-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)

-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency’s custody. Robert Moore reports: “‘We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,’ Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ‘By the Department of Homeland Security’s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.’ DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.”

-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause “significant delays” in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: “ERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.""

­-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: “The nation’s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau’s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of ‘0’ indicates perfect equality, while a score of ‘1’ indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.”

-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog’s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing’s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: “Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog’s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was ‘not what happened,’ ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was ‘simply not accurate.’”

-- Trump’s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: “The document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at ‘closed’ meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the ‘five star’ status of the US president’s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been ‘newly refurbished.’ Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: “Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.""

-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is ""on the edge of collapse."" From the AP: ""Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.""

-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: “‘It happened under my watch,’ the Saudi leader [said.] ‘I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.’ But he insists that it was without his knowledge. … [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. ‘We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,’ Prince Mohammed responded. … ‘I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible, they have the authority to do that,’ Prince Mohammed said.”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.”

-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was ‘wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.’ Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.”

-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: “In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing … The researchers … found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.”

-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: “China is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing’s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, “pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that ‘it’s not functioning well’ and excludes people who aren’t ‘walking the line.’ ‘That’s just not right,’ McCain said. ‘That’s not the party my husband and I belonged to.’ While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party’s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state’s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized — and vocal — Latino population and transplants from around the country. … ‘I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,’ McCain said. ‘I’m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: “The latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden’s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.""

-- A volunteer for Warren’s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)

-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: “The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. … Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

-- Cory Booker has crossed the halfway threshold to his $1.7 million fundraising goal. His campaign manager said that he needs to raise that much in the final 10 days of September to have a viable path forward, per Yahoo News.

-- Tulsi Gabbard qualified for the fourth Democratic debate after missing out on the third one. The Hawaii Democrat has the support of 2 percent of registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters, according to a Monmouth University poll, per the Columbus Dispatch.

The whistleblower who sounded an alarm while others bit their tongues showed that. So did the inspector general who alerted Congress to his complaint when President Trump’s loyalists were trying to keep it secret. And the public got a glimpse during a House committee hearing on Thursday of how differently this scandal might have played out if Trump's previous pick to lead the nation’s intelligence community had been confirmed.

The temperamental contrast was stark between Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), the hyper-partisan congressman who wanted the job, and Joe Maguire, the decorated military hero who got it instead and seemed eager to show he’s no one’s toady. Democrats faulted Maguire, as the acting director of national intelligence, for checking in with the very entities who a CIA whistleblower had accused of wrongdoing, including Bill Barr’s Justice Department and Trump’s White House counsel’s office, to see if they wanted to claim executive privilege to prevent the disclosure of his allegations.

Maguire noted earnestly that he was new in the role and wanted to do the right thing. The retired admiral had been running the National Counterterrorism Center after 36 years in the Navy, including as commander of Seal Team 6. He said he’s sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution 11 times. “No one can take an individual’s integrity away,” Maguire explained. “It can only be given away.”

Ratcliffe’s questioning of Maguire – which was more of a monologue, really – offered a window into how he might have handled both the complaint and the hearing if he’d found himself in the hot seat. The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation. “The United States is allowed to solicit help from a foreign government in an ongoing criminal investigation, which is exactly what President Trump did in that conversation,” Ratcliffe declared.

Ratcliffe’s hopes of getting formally nominated went down in flames on Aug. 2 after Senate Republicans expressed concern about his qualifications and evidence that he had padded his résumé. The three-term congressman had impressed Trump in July with his hostile questioning of former special counsel Bob Mueller. When the president pulled his support just a week after announcing his intention to nominate Ratcliffe, reporters asked Trump why he put someone with such limited national security experience up for such an important job without fully vetting him. “I think he would’ve picked it up very quickly,” Trump replied. “I give out a name to the press and they vet for me. We save a lot of money that way.” Trump gave the job instead to Maguire, who had no idea he’d immediately be thrust into the center of an epic fight between the White House and Congress.

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also falsely insisted that the legal opinion from the Justice Department, which claimed that intelligence community officials didn’t need to turn over the whistleblower complaint because it was outside of their jurisdiction, was written by nonpolitical lawyers. “That's an opinion from the Department of Justice ethics lawyers – not political appointees, but career officials that serve Republicans and Democrats,” Ratcliffe said during the hearing.

In fact, that opinion – released publicly on Wednesday – was authored by Trump appointee Steven Engel. Engel earned a reputation as a highly partisan figure in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which is why Democrats fought his confirmation to run the Office of Legal Counsel. He was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 47 in November 2017. As a former U.S. attorney, it seems inconceivable that Ratcliffe would not know the Office of Legal Counsel is led by a political appointee.

-- It’s also very revealing to contrast how Maguire and Trump talked about the whistleblower. The acting DNI testified that he does not know who wrote the document, but he said he doesn’t question the person’s motives. He added that he believes they “acted in good faith” and insisted that he is glad the information has finally come out. “I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” Maguire said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

As Maguire was testifying, Trump declared that the whistleblower acted like “a spy” and suggested that the legally protected conduct was akin to “treason.” Speaking in New York at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, the president made clear that he’d also like to ferret out anyone else who provided evidence of his misconduct. “I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistleblower … the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times published an audio recording of the closed-door speech, and The Post later obtained a video. “We’re at war,” Trump said in his ad-libbed remarks, referring to the scandal. “These people are sick. They’re sick. And nobody’s called it out like I do.”

-- Trump and his band of brothers have been leaning on the language of war this week. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, congratulated Democrats at the Maguire hearing on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.”

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, compared Nancy Pelosi’s speech on Tuesday night to the start of the Civil War in 1861. “Pelosi’s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter,” Bannon said. “Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.”

-- Former DNI James Clapper likened the president’s comments about the whistleblower to “witness retaliation.” “What’s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,” the Trump critic said on CNN.

WHAT’S EMERGED ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER:

-- “The whistleblower’s identity remains obscured, the details of his work for the CIA cloaked in secrecy. But the document he delivered reveals almost as much about the investigative mission he carried out in stealth as it does about the alleged abuses of power by the president,” Greg Miller reports. “[T]he CIA officer behind the whistleblower report moved swiftly behind the scenes to assemble material from at least a half-dozen highly placed — and equally dismayed — U.S. officials. He wove their accounts with other painstakingly gathered material on everything from the intervention of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage. …

“Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what [Mueller] accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment. ‘In the course of my official duties,’ the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that ‘the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.’”

-- The White House learned that a CIA officer had lodged allegations about Trump’s call even as the officer’s whistleblower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, the New York Times reports: “The officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.’s top lawyer through an anonymous process … The lawyer shared the officer’s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. … But as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that [CIA general counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood] had contacted the White House … While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.”

“The whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.,” per Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner in the Times. “His complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.”

-- The AP also reports that White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer’s concerns about Trump “around the same time the individual filed a whistleblower complaint.” Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo and Zeke Miller say that information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration:

“On Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ’s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA. John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told. In the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community’s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.”

-- Responding to reader criticism, Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended their decision to publish information about the whistleblower and noted that the White House already knew he was a CIA officer. “We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible,” Baquet wrote. “The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the U.S. abused power and whether the W.H. covered it up.”

-- The whistleblower emphasized in the complaint that he was not the only one worried. “The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,” he wrote in his complaint. “They told me there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

NEW DETAILS ON WHAT RUDY WAS UP TO:

-- Giuliani spent months cultivating relationships with five current and former prosecutors in Ukraine to achieve a particular goal: Helping Trump win next year’s election by pursuing allegations damaging to his Democratic rivals. Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family. ... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election. … Some of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information. … A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said. Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year. Lutsenko said that Giuliani tried to arrange a meeting with him two times before they finally managed to connect on the third try in January, ‘I took a vacation. I took my youngest son, I showed him New York and I met with Mr. Giuliani,’ Lutsenko said. ‘I had a long conversation with him. But this was only in the forum of exchanging information.’

""Lutsenko met with Giuliani again in Warsaw in mid-February, then for a third and final time ‘in Europe,’ he said, refusing to be more specific. Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws. But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

-- One of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's political rivals in Kiev is demanding that he release the government's transcript of the call, as Zelensky finds himself in hot water across Europe for his criticisms of the French and Germans. Siobhán O’Grady and Rick Noack report: “In a Facebook post, [Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko] called it ‘strange that the [Ukrainian] President’s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.’ … [In the call, Zelensky] praised Trump and went on to say he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: ‘They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.’ Those comments were not well received in Europe. ‘To say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,’ [said] Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.”

-- Conservative columnist John Solomon, executive vice president of the Hill newspaper, helped craft the flawed Ukraine narrative that would later be echoed by Trump, his son Don Jr., and Giuliani. Paul Farhi reports: “Back in March, the Hill newspaper published a series of stories and interviews that seemed, at the time, to be mainly of interest to foreign-policy wonks. [Solomon] interviewed Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, [Lutsenko], who alleged a startling conspiracy: that law enforcement officials within his country had leaked damaging information in 2016 against Paul Manafort ... to help ... Clinton’s presidential campaign. … The story touched off a brushfire within the conservative media, in which Solomon is a prominent figure, but stayed largely out of mainstream view. On Thursday, however, Solomon’s work gained new attention — and raised new questions about its sourcing, credibility and motivation. In [the whistleblower's complaint], Solomon’s stories were cited as part of a narrative about the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.”

-- Trump appears to be counting on confusion over the complex Ukraine story to offer a fog of false claims and allegations to make it appear Joe Biden did something wrong. The Post’s Fact Checker team published a short guide this morning to Trump’s statements — and the truth.

-- And Philip Bump created a helpful timeline of the significant dates in the whistleblower’s complaint to provide more clarity on how Trump's and Giuliani’s efforts to get dirt on Biden unfolded.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meets Vice President Pence on Sept. 1 in Warsaw. (Petr David Josek/AP)

CASCADING FALLOUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE:

-- Vice President Pence is trying to dodge the impeachment spotlight, but his Ukraine moves are attracting notice. Toluse Olorunnipa and Ashley Parker report: “Pence did not participate in [the July call] … But Pence’s name has emerged in several other contexts … The whistleblower complaint … said Pence canceled a planned trip to Ukraine at the direction of Trump, who was seeking to pressure the Ukrainians to help him politically. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed that Pence’s attendance had been requested at Zelensky’s inauguration and that his office had looked at dates for a visit to Kiev. … The vice president’s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky, and his discussions with Trump, will be key targets for House Democrats … Pence told reporters after the meeting that he had not discussed Biden with Zelensky but said that he had relayed Trump’s ‘great concerns about issues of corruption.’”

-- “The White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public. Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report: “The number of aides allowed to listen on secure ‘drop’ lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call’s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with ‘EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.’ And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak … At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials. …

“The complaint said the transcript was ‘loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.’ According to the whistleblower, ‘one White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.’ … The July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. … Once the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump’s comments, according to the complaint.”

-- Lost in the controversy over Trump’s phone call is Zelensky's effort to curry favor with the president through his private business. Jonathan O’Connell and David Fahrenthold report: “‘Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,’ Zelensky told Trump [according to the transcript of their July 25 call] ... Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him abut it. … It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.""

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced impeachment investigation that could lead to a vote around Thanksgiving. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as [Pelosi] is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-line’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’ Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee…

“Some senior Democrats are even arguing that other committees should forgo potentially explosive hearings that could distract from the intelligence panel’s work … ‘Very few hearings, if any,’ said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. … But many of the moderate freshmen do not want to be seen as rushing to conclusions — whether on the Ukraine probe or any other aspect of potential presidential wrongdoing. … A senior Democratic aide familiar with discussions among the party’s moderate wing relayed concerns that a probe seen as moving too rapidly by the public could backfire. …

“One of the first credible polls to test the Democratic impeachment push following Pelosi’s Tuesday announcement found the public almost evenly split. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll conducted Wednesday found Americans approving 49 percent to 46 percent of the House inquiry, with independents disapproving 50 percent to 44 percent.""

-- Pelosi explained to the New Yorker that impeaching Trump for “bad behavior” isn’t worth it. The difference now is the president, she contends, is undermining democracy and the electoral system. David Remnick writes up his interview: “When I asked Pelosi if she thought Trump knows, in this instance or any other, the difference between right and wrong, she replied, ‘He knows the difference between right and wrong, but I don’t know that he really cares. I do think his categorical imperative is what’s good is what is right for him. In the campaign, he told us who he was. He said that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care, that his supporters wouldn’t care. Well, he could violate our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, and dishonor his oath of office, as he did in this call, and think that nobody cares.’”

-- She’s back: Hillary Clinton is doing a media tour to express support for impeachment, starting with CBS and continuing with additional TV sit-downs next week. The former secretary of state called the man who beat her in 2016 a “corrupt human tornado” and an “illegitimate president.” HRC’s appearances probably aren’t helpful to the Democratic cause and make it look like they’re trying to relitigate the 2016 campaign.

-- Trump is writing the Republican playbook on impeachment, and he’s going with a scorched-earth strategy. Will it work? Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: “Trump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid. And in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump’s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it. … Trump’s advisers said they envision a ‘split screen’ strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.”

-- Politico co-founder John Harris, who covered Bill Clinton’s impeachment for The Post, remembers that impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity: “The week showed it's just more fodder for the ideological and culture wars.”

THE (FEW) REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS:

-- Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker endorsed an impeachment inquiry of Trump, joining fellow Republican governor Phil Scott of Vermont. ""It’s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it,” Baker told reporters in the Bay State. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to requests for comment, per Reis Thebault.

-- Former Republican senator Jeff Flake said “at least 35” GOP senators would privately vote for Trump’s impeachment. The Arizonan, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, was responding to veteran Republican political consultant Mike Murphy's suggestion on MSNBC that 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump if it was “a secret vote.” “That’s not true,” Flake said in Texas. “There would be at least 35.” (Fox News)

-- The president's leading advisers are concerned about the ""threat"" posed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and are ""trying to isolate him,"" Jonathan Martin reports in the Times: ""Mr. Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. … To Mr. Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party. ‘Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right, which is just what I do,’ he said. … Mr. Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s grip. But as Mr. Romney contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain quiet in the face of such misconduct.”

-- “Because Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes,” writes Michael Gerson, who served as chief speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House. “By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump’s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat. Because Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during [Mueller’s] investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo. But this is more of a rally chant than an argument.”

Gerson, a Trump critic, believes impeachment has become inevitable: “Impeachment may be inadvisable. It may apply a cheese grater to the nation’s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump’s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN. All of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump’s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice.”

A RANGE OF VOICES FROM THE POST'S OPINION PAGE:

-- The whistleblower complaint strengthens the case that Trump offered Ukraine’s president a quid pro quo, inveighs the Editorial Board.

-- We sent aid to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's ongoing occupation. By holding back American support, Trump helped Putin, writes Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration.

-- Trump’s impeachment need not be a long, drawn-out affair, writes liberal Eugene Robinson: “The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.”

-- The whistleblower complaint doesn’t do the Democrats any favors, argues conservative Henry Olsen: “It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.”

-- Democrats are sprinting ahead of the evidence, adds conservative Marc Thiessen, another former Bush speechwriter.

­-- The whistleblower and the vulnerable Democratic freshmen who backed an impeachment inquiry are profiles in courage, writes conservative Max Boot: “This week reminds us that there are some people in Washington who are not motivated solely by self-interest — that there are actually a few people in positions of public responsibility who care about the Constitution and are willing to run considerable risks to protect it.”

-- Americans have already seen enough for three articles of impeachment, argues Jennifer Rubin, a lawyer by training.

-- As alarming as the allegations are against Trump, impeachment is still not required, writes Princeton University professor Keith Whittington: “The House would not necessarily be failing to do its ‘constitutional duty’ if it did not pass articles of impeachment.”

Refugees gather in front of the White House. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Trump administration slashed the number of refugees who will be admitted to the U.S. next year to a historic low of 18,000. David Nakamura, Maria Sacchetti and Seung Min Kim report: “The new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama’s final year in office. In addition, the Trump administration announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.""

A breakdown of who is being let in: ""Under the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to people fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies. Last year’s cap of 30,000 divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.”

-- Matthew Albence, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, once again took aim at “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help the feds deport undocumented immigrants. This time, he did so from the podium in the White House briefing room. Maria Sacchetti reports: “Albence criticized jurisdictions in several states after the agency arrested nearly 1,300 migrants during the past week via Operation Cross Check, a recurring immigration roundup of people convicted of crimes that include murder, manslaughter and child abuse. Nearly 200 of those arrested could have been taken into custody in a state prison or a local jail, he said. Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down. … Albence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support.”

-- Organizations challenging Trump’s attempt to end protections for the Dreamers picked Ted Olson, a former Republican solicitor general and lawyer long associated with conservative causes, to argue their case before the Supreme Court. The choice might’ve been more surprising had Olson not played a similar role in the legal battle for same-sex marriage. (Robert Barnes)

­-- An undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong house in Southaven, Miss. Now, the city is fighting a civil rights lawsuit by arguing that, because of his immigration status, he wasn’t protected by the U.S. Constitution. Antonia Noori Farzan reports: “Attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because [Ismael] Lopez had no ‘legally recognized relationship’ with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens. ‘If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,’ attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. ‘Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the ‘We, the People of the United States’ entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.’”

-- The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government open through Nov. 21. Erica Werner reports: “The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it. The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- The Senate also confirmed Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to succeed Alex Acosta as labor secretary. Felicia Sonmez and Eli Rosenberg report: “Scalia was confirmed Thursday on a 53-to-44 vote. Democrats have argued that Scalia’s record as a corporate lawyer has shown him to be ‘anti-worker.’ In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by Trump as a ‘disgrace.’”

-- And the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Trump’s pick to become the second-highest-ranking military officer after a bruising nomination fight centering on allegations of sexual assault from a former aide. Missy Ryan and Karoun Demirjian report: “Senators voted 75 to 22 to confirm Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, who has headed U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the lone Republican to vote against Hyten, while all Democratic senators running for president either voted against him or were absent, save Michael F. Bennet of Colorado. Bennet voted in favor.”

-- The U.S. military’s suicide rate for active-duty troops has climbed over the past five years, a Pentagon report reveals. Dan Lamothe reports: “Some 541 service members died by suicide in 2018, including 325 active-duty troops, the report said. The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013. … Service members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon’s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.”

-- Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives faces growing Republican concerns over his commitment to gun rights. From the Journal: “Failing to confirm [Chuck] Canterbury would leave the ATF without a permanent, politically appointed director at a time when the law enforcement agency is at the forefront of the Trump administration’s fight against violent crime and as the White House and Congress continue to negotiate gun-control measures after several mass shootings in recent months. … Mr. Canterbury tangled in his July confirmation hearing with Republican senators who were frustrated that he wouldn’t clearly define his views on gun-control measures such as expanding background checks for prospective buyers and a ban on assault rifles. He was head of the FOP when it took positions supporting more-rigorous gun-control measures including an expansion of background checks. But he wouldn’t immediately say what stance he would take if confirmed to the ATF, only that he would consult with other Justice Department officials.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency formally told California it is “failing to meet its obligations” to protect the environment. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report: “Days after President Trump mocked Los Angeles and other big cities for their ‘tremendous pollution,’ EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an oversight letter charging California officials with failing to meet federal health standards in numerous communities where large homeless populations litter the streets with trash, drug paraphernalia and human waste. … California has long led the nation in demanding stricter limits on pollution linked to climate change. Now, the Trump administration is arguing that the state’s focus on global warming has come at the expense of more basic environmental protections.”

-- Seeking to fill the void created by Trump's inaction, six U.S. governors gathered in Manhattan on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to confer with presidents, prime ministers and other foreign leaders to press for action on climate change. Carol Morello reports: “The governors in the group, most of them Democrats, insist they are not conducting a form of shadow diplomacy. They say neither the White House nor the State Department, which typically conducts talks with foreign governments, has tried to deter their efforts. Their mission is to assure other countries that many of America’s leaders are still engaged in combating climate change, even if the United States formally drops out of the Paris agreement next year. ‘Every party looking at this should know there is still intelligent life in the United States taking action on climate change,’ Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a co-founder of the Climate Alliance, said in a back-seat interview en route to a meeting with officials from the European Union. ‘It’s important to give the world confidence of movement, of dynamic actions being taken in America. And it’s succeeded. Not a single country has left the agreement. No one has followed Donald Trump over the cliff.’”

-- A federal judge denied a request by the news media to unseal grand jury records cited in the Mueller report. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden’s advisers are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street now that the former vice president stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a “wealth tax” on the richest Americans. Jeff Stein reports: “The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds ... Tax experts said Biden’s embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.”

-- Some anxious Biden supporters want him to embrace a super PAC. From the Times: “Several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. ‘For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,’ said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. ‘And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.’”

-- Democratic donors from Wall Street are threatening to back Trump or sit out the 2020 campaign if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination. From CNBC: “‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive ... Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren’s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. ‘They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,’ an executive at one of the nation’s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.”

-- White, college-educated voters are driving Warren's rise in the polls. Eugene Scott reports: “The lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.”

-- In a fundraising email, Julián Castro warned that his campaign will be over is he doesn’t qualify for the November debate. From the Texas Tribune: “The email sought donations for ads to help him reach the new polling threshold: 3% in four national polls or 5% in two surveys from the first four early voting states. Castro has already met the donor requirement of 165,000 individuals but hasn't met the polling requirement — or even come close.”

-- Sen. Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California, said Giuliani should probably be disbarred. “We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “And frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani’s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.” (Politico)

-- Former Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, who resigned in disgrace, threw his hat in the ring to take over retiring Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson’s Georgia seat. From ABC News: “According to the Georgia governor's office, Price submitted his resume to be considered for replacing Isakson, who announced in August that he is resigning from his post in December due to various health issues. Isakson, 74, won a six-year term in 2016 and his term is due to end in 2022.”

-- A U.S. attorney whose office investigated interference in the 2018 midterm elections said he is certain Russia will try to meddle in the upcoming presidential race. Rachel Weiner reports: “‘They’re going to do the same thing,’ G. Zachary Terwilliger said Thursday afternoon at an event at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. ‘They’re going to do it. In an open setting like this there’s not a lot I can get into, but I think it wouldn’t be irresponsible for me to say they’re definitely going to try.’ … Terwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that ‘their big concern is deepfakes,’ or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the ‘actual physical infrastructure’ of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Pentagon authorized a modest air defense boost for Saudi Arabia after the attack on the kingdom’s oil industry. Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe report: “Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration’s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions. … Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would ‘augment the kingdom’s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.’ ‘These steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,’ he said in a statement.”

-- Iraq is trying to rein in its Iran-aligned militias as tensions boil in the Persian Gulf. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “Iraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout. ‘The prime minister was very angry,’ said one lawmaker. … Iraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict.”

-- Syrian government forces carried out a chlorine attack in May, a U.S. intelligence assessment found. From the Journal: “The episode took place on May 19 near the village of Kabana as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces sought to subdue resistance in Latakia province, a senior U.S. official said. … At least four people were wounded in the rocket strike, which was alleged at the time by the Syrian opposition but took months for U.S. intelligence to confirm. The Syrian government has denied the attack.”

-- The fiancée of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi is demanding that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for his murder. Oct. 2 is the anniversary of his death. Hatice Cengiz spoke with NBC News on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly: ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet,’ she said. ""Saudi Arabia was put under massive pressure, thanks to international media coverage … But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad.""

-- Trump’s privately held company, seeking to revive its money-losing golf course in Scotland, secured approval to build 550 luxury and holiday homes there, as well as a second golf course. Joshua Partlow reports: “The Aberdeenshire Council voted 38 to 24 to allow the Trump Organization’s residential development to move forward despite vocal opposition from many residents who fear it would crowd the roads and schools of their windswept village. By winning the council’s approval, the Trump Organization is poised for one of its most ambitious foreign projects of his presidency. It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump’s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. … In a sign of its confidence in Wednesday’s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing extensive backlash after delivering a bombastic performance upon his return to Parliament. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The widower of a murdered lawmaker and the sister of the prime minister joined a chorus of voices on Thursday saying [Johnson] has stepped over a line with his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit. But Johnson was refusing to change course on his language or his strategy. … Johnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled ‘Britain first!’ before shooting and stabbing her to death. … Johnson [said] that the best way to honor Cox’s memory would be to ‘get Brexit done.’ … Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother’s remarks ‘tasteless.’”

-- Afghanistan's presidential election is this weekend, and voters are torn between fear, frustration and a sense of duty. From the AP: “The Taliban have relentlessly issued threats against Saturday’s vote. The insurgent group has sent suicide bombers to rallies and election offices, killing dozens and warning they will kill more. ... Afghan officials say security preparations have been elaborate. In an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Interior Masoud Andarabi outlined an election security plan that he said has been more than eight months in the making. ... Despite the government’s best efforts, 431 polling centers will be closed Saturday because Andarabi, the interior minister, said they were too difficult to secure — either because they were under Taliban control or Taliban could threaten nearby villages.”

-- Concerns about fraud are also running high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. The main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned of dire consequences if the polls are marred by fraud. Pamela Constable and Susannah George report: “Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to ‘act responsibly.’ ‘The results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,” Abdullah said at his residence. ‘The signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,’ he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.”

He represented his community with integrity, respect and pride,” Gonzalez said. “And again, he was respected by all.”

Dhaliwal, 41, was returning to his patrol car around 1 p.m. when a man got out of the stopped car with a pistol and shot him “in a coldblooded manner, ambush-style,” Gonzalez said. He said he did not know the reason for the stop or the motive for the shooting.

AD

First responders brought Dhaliwal to a hospital, where he was declared dead around 4 p.m.

AD

Robert Solis, 47, was charged with capital murder in connection with the killing, the sheriff’s office announced Friday. He had an active parole-violation warrant in a January 2017 case in which he was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

A woman whom police believed to be a passenger in the stopped car was also in custody Friday, the sheriff’s office said. Officials said they had confiscated the gun they believed Solis used in the shooting.

Dhaliwal, whom his colleagues described as a “trailblazer,” owned a lucrative trucking business before he sold it to join the sheriff’s department, said Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia. Dhaliwal wanted to build a bridge between the department and the Houston area’s large Sikh community because of a prior “mishap,” Garcia said.

AD

Garcia did not offer details about that incident, but The Washington Post previously reported that he reached out to Sikhs in 2009 because of a confrontation with a Sikh family the prior year. When the family called to report a burglary, deputies reportedly were alarmed to see the men wearing beards and turbans and carrying small daggers, which Sikhs sometimes wear at their waists as a reminder of their faith’s martial history. The deputies called for more officers and interrogated the family, The Post reported.

AD

A husband and a father of three children, Dhaliwal joined the Harris County Sheriff’s Office as a detention officer and worked his way up. He was the first adherent of Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that originated in India, to become a deputy.

The Harris County sheriff in 2015 announced that Dhaliwal would be allowed to wear his religion’s beard and turban while on patrol. At the time, only police departments in the District of Columbia and Riverside, Calif., had made that accommodation.

AD

Dhaliwal was known to have a giving heart, Gonzalez said. He coordinated the arrival of a tractor-trailer that brought donations from California to the Houston area in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey. When a colleague’s relatives in Puerto Rico needed help after Hurricane Maria the same year, Gonzalez said, Dhaliwal joined the department’s trip to provide aid there.

AD

Dhaliwal’s last actions were ones of service, Gonzalez said.

“He died a hero,” Gonzalez said. “He died serving the Harris County community.”

Sheriff’s Office Maj. Mike Lee, who watched the dashboard-camera video of Dhaliwal’s traffic stop, told reporters that the driver-side door of the suspect’s car was open for about two minutes while Dhaliwal talked with him. The conversation did not appear combative, Lee said.

AD

Dhaliwal then shut the car door and began to walk back to his patrol car, Lee said. About three seconds later, Lee said Solis opened the door, got out with a gun in his hand and ran toward Dhaliwal. He shot Dhaliwal in the back of the head, Lee said.

A neighbor reported hearing two gunshots and seeing the shooter run away and leave in a “getaway car,” Lee told reporters. He did not specify whether that car was the stopped vehicle or a different one. Authorities found the suspect inside a business about a quarter-mile from the shooting scene, Lee said.

AD

As a sign of respect, Gonzalez said, sheriff’s office deputies lined the walkway to the medical examiner’s office when Dhaliwal’s body was brought there. Community members later held an impromptu memorial vigil.

AD

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said in a statement that he stood with Dhaliwal’s family and the Sikh community.

“He represented the diversity and inclusiveness of our community and everything that is good,” Turner wrote. “Evil you do not win here.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Dhaliwal’s death was a reminder of the daily risks that law enforcement officers face.

“I thank the officers who bravely responded to apprehend the suspect, and I assure you that the state of Texas is committed to bringing this killer to justice,” Abbott said in a statement.

Simran Jeet Singh, senior fellow at the civil rights group Sikh Coalition, told The Post that only a handful of Sikhs have served in U.S. law enforcement. Most departments’ policies ban headwear, Singh said, and few police forces have allowed Sikhs to wear beards and turbans on patrol.

AD

“To have an office that’s opened itself up to Sikh service and also at the same time to have candidates who are interested and willing to get into this work, it’s been quite challenging,” Singh said.

Sikhism, the world’s fifth-largest religion with about 25 million followers, emphasizes devotion to God, truthfulness, the equality of all people, and the denunciation of superstitions and blind rituals. There are about 500,000 Sikhs in the United States.

Sikhs frequently face discrimination in the United States They have been confused with Muslims — and wrongly associated with terrorism — since the 9/11 attacks. In 2012, a white-supremacist gunman killed six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.

AD

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “'Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.'”

AD

She continued: “It sounds like it’s straight out of some bad drama, but the fact is this is the president of the United States.”

Harris was joined by fellow Democratic candidates Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro, who suggested that Trump’s comments could endanger the lives of the whistleblower and anyone else who aided in the complaint. Trump was also rebuked by some Republicans, including former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who are challenging the president for the GOP nomination, and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.).

AD

In a joint statement, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform Committees argued that Trump’s remarks amounted to “reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress’ impeachment inquiry.”

AD

“We condemn the President’s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,” said the statement from Reps. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). “Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment early Friday.

AD

Trump’s statements came after the House released a nine-page version of the whistleblower’s complaint. According to the complaint and a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, offering assistance from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of a White House sit-down. The call took place after Trump had halted almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

AD

As Democrats speed up their impeachment investigation, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to attack the credibility of the whistleblower and the complaint, highlighting that many of the allegations rely on secondhand information from other U.S. officials.

Thursday’s private event, which was closed to the press, was intended to honor the staff and families of the U.S. delegation, but Trump took it as an opportunity to grouse about his enemies. During his speech, the president again went after Biden, the “crooked” media and the whistleblower’s complaint.

AD

“Basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call,” Trump said of the whistleblower on Thursday. “Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is — sort of like, almost, a spy.”

Then, the president appeared to suggest that the whistleblower and whoever may have supplied the person with information about the Ukraine call had behaved like spies. Trump also mentioned treason, which in the past has been punished by death.

AD

In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Booker said Trump sounded “more like a threatening thug than giving forth the ideals of a statesman” and accused the president of using rhetoric that “gives license to people to do dangerous things.”

AD

“It’s not surprising that Donald Trump doesn’t know the difference between patriotism and treason,” the New Jersey senator said. “If there’s any treasonous actions here, it is coming from the White House.”

Castro, who also appeared on MSNBC, called the president a “dictator.” In Castro’s view, Trump had suggested that the whistleblower “should basically be killed.”

Meanwhile, other presidential candidates took aim at Trump on Twitter, echoing criticisms that his comment constituted a threat.

“This is wrong and this is un-American,” Walsh tweeted about Trump’s attacks on the whistleblower. “And Congressional Republicans say nothing. Shameful. History is watching.”

Several politicians also defended the whistleblower, with some referencing federal laws protecting those who expose wrongdoing. There are specific guidelines for whistleblowers in the intelligence community, who are protected from retaliation so long as they follow proper protocol when submitting complaints.

“This person is not a spy,” Hurd said at an event in Austin on Thursday night, according to the Dallas Morning News. “Let me say that very clearly. This is clearly somebody who knew the consequences of what he or she was doing … and they shared it through the right mechanism.”

Harris expressed concerns that Trump was failing to uphold the law and respect the system created for whistleblowers.

In a video shared on Twitter, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanked the whistleblower for “an extraordinary act of courage.”

“Trump has used the word treasonous to describe this whistleblower,” Sanders said. “Well, let me tell you what I think treasonous activity is. It is a president who is trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States and a president who thinks he is above the law.”

In total, the Trump campaign and its backers spent between $346,700 and $1,430,182 on more than 2,000 ads for its Facebook page from Monday to midday Friday, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. She obtained the data through Facebook’s public ad archive, which reports all of its data in ranges, not precise figures. Those ads had been viewed between 13.3 million and 25.3 million times, the NYU analysis found.

On Tuesday and Wednesday alone, the campaign shelled out about $500,000 on Facebook ads, according to figures tallied by ACRONYM, a digital outfit focused on liberal causes. On Wednesday alone it spent about $350,000, an amount it typically spends in a week.

The online offensive offered a window into Trump’s bare-knuckle approach to the coming impeachment battles, as he took the showdown to his favored terrain: the Internet. Already, campaign officials say they have filled their coffers with contributions: Eric Trump, the president’s second son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said Thursday that the campaign had raised $8.5 million in the previous 24 hours.

The Facebook ads, which traffic in claims found to be false by The Washington Post Fact Checker, also provided a new test for the technology giant after it reaffirmed this week it would exempt speech by politicians from fact checking. That exemption, company executives said, also applies to ads, though sponsored posts are required to meet community standards that proscribe threats as well as “content aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive another of money, property, or legal right.”

On Friday, Facebook said none of the ads violated its policies, including those that prohibit dehumanizing speech, though the company did not detail its reasoning. A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

As Trump flooded social media with impeachment-related advertising, would-be challengers competing for the Democratic nomination moved gingerly on the platforms. While it appeared that every one of the hundreds of ads placed by Trump’s campaign since Tuesday used the word “impeachment,” not a single ad placed by Joe Biden, the former vice president, used the word. Biden said this week he would favor impeachment proceedings if the White House tried to thwart congressional oversight activities.

AD

AD

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala D. Harris of California, both of whom had previously called for the president’s impeachment, each ran ads on the topic but far fewer than the general fundraising appeals they released that made no mention of the president.

In ads targeting mainly women, Warren asked users to sign a petition calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. Harris asked users, mainly in California, to sign a card thanking Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the speaker of the House, “for showing the leadership the White House lacks by beginning an impeachment inquiry.”

Biden, who became the subject of a July conversation between Trump and the president of Ukraine, placed new ads condemning the president for soliciting help from a foreign leader to smear him. But Biden stopped short of mentioning impeachment.

AD

AD

In addition to the individual candidates, the national party committees produced dueling advertising on the topic, with the Democratic National Committee asking users to donate to show their support for an impeachment inquiry and the Republican National Committee asking users to “stand against impeachment.” The GOP’s ads appeared to target in particular a swath of states in the Midwest, as well as New York, Pennsylvania and Maine.

The RNC said Friday it would join the Trump campaign in spending a total of $10 million across television and digital platforms assailing Democrats for beginning an impeachment inquiry. The campaign will spend $8 million, while the party will kick in another $2 million.

For months, Facebook spending on impeachment has been dominated by Tom Steyer, the investor turned impeachment activist, and his super PAC, Need to Impeach.

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

The closing days of a fundraising quarter are usually hectic for presidential candidates and their top-level staffers, who are tasked with pulling in every last dime they can find and figuring out what to do with the cash. This week — punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president — was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country’s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they’d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns — or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team’s Friday gathering as “a ‘we’re fucked, what do we do?’ meeting.”

The big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden’s team using Donald Trump’s lashing out as evidence of Biden’s electability — proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election — while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.

That’s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn’t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible — to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn’t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter — which ends with September, on Monday — he would have to drop out, deprived of a “legitimate long-term path forward,” in Demissie’s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker’s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker’s push.

Booker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.

“The media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there’s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,” says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “The entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it’s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.”

A senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: “It sucks, actually. Impeachment’s gonna kill anyone who’s not a senator or in the top five. We’re fucked.”

The likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn’t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (“It’s been the most nationalized race I’ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,” said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it’s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the “one way you can break through right now,” since ads aren’t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn’t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, “the choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,” said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. “The main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.”

Some candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump’s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates’ digital fundraising numbers.

So far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down — they’ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump’s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer — who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, and who doesn’t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get — unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their “we’re fucked” meetings. “You basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,” said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.

And, as Julián Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.

The best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week’s deluge proves atypical. “I’m not sure how long it’s gonna last,” said one strategist for a faltering campaign.

Castro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. “I don’t say this lightly,” he wrote to supporters on Thursday. “If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.”"

Ben: Over the last few months, Joe Biden has managed to fend off persistent criticism about his record, his handsiness, and his age, among other things, maintaining a consistent lead in Democratic primary polls all the while. But with the explosion of the Trump-Ukraine revelations, he finds himself in the middle of a scandal that’s really about the president’s corruption — but which also makes him an easy target for the right, who claim that he and his son Hunter are the real villains in all this. Meanwhile, in a possibly related development, Elizabeth Warren is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire. Is this whole thing a curse for Biden?

Gabriel: There’s definitely a lot going on here, but first let’s note: Warren’s upward trend has been going on for quite a long time. It’s not like she’s shot up in the polls as Trump has pushed his line on Biden’s “scandal” — which, let’s also be clear, there’s still no evidence to support is a real one. All that said, it’s hard to see how this is a net positive for Biden if it continues to be covered and thought about like it has been so far. His team has made a fairly persuasive case that Trump has been so focused on Biden, including in pushing this Ukraine theory, because he is most worried about him in a general election. That, of course, makes sense: Just look at the preliminary polling that shows Biden beating Trump consistently. This is great for Biden’s central message of electability. However, a lot of the coverage — i.e., the way real voters are consuming this saga — has nonetheless put new scrutiny on Biden’s son, Hunter, in a way that’s hard for Biden to defend, even if the actual substance of Hunter’s work wasn’t illegal, and the specific accusations about Joe Biden, as vice-president, interfering in Ukrainian investigations is unfounded.

But I think it’s instructive to look at how Biden himself is talking about all this. Here he is at a fundraiser in California yesterday: “Now, I know that even though there’s not been one single shred of evidence substantiating any accusation made, and today, the leading prosecutor, the headline in the Washington Post was, the prosecutor in, that they’re trying to convince to say something differently, in, in Ukraine said there’s nothing anybody in my family did wrong or at all. But folks, this isn’t about me. It’s never been about me. It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Health care, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that’s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. So I’m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.”

This was after he recounted the actual big deal here: Trump’s call, and the whistle-blower’s report. So Biden clearly wants to talk about his own family … not at all.

Ben: Right. And he seemed a little bit tentative in his initial response to all this, which is a bit odd, considering the gravity and outrageousness of what the president was trying to do to him.

Gabriel: It’s useful to think of it all in the context of Biden’s whole career and political persona. He is very, very, very protective of his family, understandably, and simultaneously very invested in what he perceives to be his image as a straight shooter. So this is a double whammy.

Again, though, there’s no evidence that the accusations are true. Can’t stress that enough. So it’s understandable that there are a lot of nerves in Democratic circles that analysts/pundits are talking around that fact and immediately jumping to: doesn’t this look bad for Biden? I can’t tell you how many Clinton ‘16 alums have made a complaint like that to me in recent days. Not complaining about Biden’s actions, to be clear, but about how Trump has warped the public discussion around him to drag his opponent down.

Ben: So you’re saying the allegations might be true? #democrathoax

Gabriel: You’ll have to check the transcript memo.

Ben: Yes, it is crazy-making that we’re all aware of the game Trump is playing, and then we have to do this kind of meta-questioning of whether it’s working. I mean, I’m doing that right now. But, as I was saying to our colleague Ed yesterday, logic and fairness and rationality isn’t really the name of the game in politics, especially at the moment.

Gabriel: Well, I think it’s not crazy to assert that Biden’s entire pitch is based on the premise that you’ll be proven wrong about that.

Ben: That rationality is making a comeback?

Gabriel: That reason will prevail.

Ben: It may, but there will still be a dangerously high level of silliness floating around.

Gabriel: All this said, I think there’s a real question about how other Democratic candidates talk about this.

There’s already been some obvious discomfort. Warren was asked if her VP’s son could work abroad like Hunter Biden, and she initially said no, then said she had to check her plan to be sure. Castro has basically just defended Biden and refused to engage. No one has said “this is corrupt!” or agreed with Trump, obviously, but they’re proceeding with immense caution.

Ben: Yeah, it’s a bit like the age issue. Pressing it too overtly is likely to backfire, as Castro recently learned.

Reporting indicates that Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats want to do this impeachment thing pretty quickly. Do you get the sense that the Biden camp is relieved about that fact? That by the time Iowa rolls around, the process might already be over?

Gabriel: It’s very hard to tell, I think they’re still trying to figure it out, just like everyone else. If you’re a leading candidate, though, the prospect of an impeachment proceeding playing out during the primaries is a bit scary, since the politics of the impeachment are completely up in the air. It’s just an unpredictable landscape. That said, obviously Biden’s team doesn’t want “Biden,” “corruption,” “Ukraine,” “investigation” to show up in context-free headlines for the next six months (even if the other words in the headline are “Trump” “impeach,” etc.), but realistically the ongoing impeachment process is likely to move the national focus even further away from the narrow question of Hunter Biden’s work, anyway. Republicans may continue to press on the Biden accusations, but that’s likely the case, no matter how long the impeachment inquiry takes.

Ben: Biden hasn’t been shy about going after Trump directly — his whole early strategy was to paint the president as a sui generis monster, which was in contrast to some of his rivals, who tended not to focus so much on the president (until they saw how well it was working for Biden). Could this episode work to his advantage in that it provides more evidence that Trump simply needs to be thrown out of office, and the one person who can do that is Joe?

Gabriel: That’s what Biden is betting. Look at what his campaign manager said to Politico for a story this morning: “Why are you punching someone? Because you’re afraid of them.” The question is how Biden communicates that to voters without amplifying Trump’s attacks. And, just as importantly, how other candidates counter it without feeding into Trump’s line of argument.

Ben: To return to Warren: Perhaps the clearest sign yet of her threat to Biden is that his campaign is reportedly mulling a wealth tax, cribbing a page from her (and Bernie Sanders’s) playbook. Does this strike you as a sound political strategy?

Gabriel: I mean, he’s been saying over and over at private fundraisers, surrounded by rich people: Don’t expect anything from me, I’m not going to make your lives easier. So no one is going to start thinking of Biden as a crusader against the one percent, obviously, but it may soften some of the criticisms from the left, just a tiny bit. We don’t know what this’ll look like, yet, though. Reports just have his advisers “considering” the move. It’s not like he’s trying to win over the Bernie ‘16 crowd, just to prove he gets it. And FWIW I think the clearest sign of her threat to Biden is her beating him in polling.

Ben: Fair enough.

Gabriel: Going back to how Biden talks about all this, and everyone else responds, for a sec: We may have just gotten a very consequential development. CNN and the Times, who are co-hosting the next debate, just announced that it’ll be one night only. And we know that there are almost certainly going to be 12 candidates onstage, which by definition means candidates will have less time than ever to actually talk, unless the debate is, like, four hours long. There’s no way Trump’s impeachment doesn’t come up pretty prominently, obviously, so we’ll see soon how candidates talk about Biden’s side of this. What do you think would be an effective way for a long shot who needs Biden to falter to answer the question?

Ben: The questionee has become the questioner.

Were I a long-shot candidate, I don’t think my strategy would be to go after Biden directly on this issue. I don’t think it would engender any sympathy from Democratic voters — and this is the sort of thing that’s so thick in the air that it doesn’t need explicating. But perhaps you could get away with some more subtle questioning of Biden’s electability, which is his most powerful argument for the nomination. You could mention that Biden has a lot of baggage (which is true) without directly tying it to impeachment. What do you think?

Gabriel: You could try it, but the last three people to go after Biden in debates, however subtly or overtly, only got very momentary support, if any, out of doing it (Harris, Booker, Castro.) The most effective play in the eyes of voters might be to say exactly what Biden is saying: This is a distraction, and we can’t afford to be distracted. That’s saying something similar without actually saying it. But that’s also admitting Trump has way more power to set the conversation than you probably want to admit."

8:29 a.m. Trump calls on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign and “be investigated” for reading a fake transcript of the president’s call with Ukraine at a hearing yesterday. In Trump’s telling, Schiff was “supposedly reading the exact transcribed version” and “GOT CAUGHT.” Schiff, who as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is emerging as a key point person in the impeachment drama, had actually been a bit more nuanced. He introduced the fabulism by calling it “the essence of what the president communicates.” The moment was nonetheless potentially misleading, especially because sound bites are regularly chopped without context on social media.

9:04 a.m. The White House releases a memo headlined, “The swamp is beyond parody, but the American people aren’t laughing.” The argument is that Democrats are spending their time on a “political circus” instead of “real, pressing concerns” such as strong border security, real gun safety, affordable prescription drug prices and a new North American trade deal. “You can’t make this stuff up,” the memo reads.

She cites Giuliani’s appearance the night before on Fox News, in which he showed text messages he claimed to be from State Department officials urging him to reach out. Harris also addresses a tweet to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, telling him to “instruct State Department staff to preserve any communications involving” Giuliani.

2:30 p.m. The Associated Press alerts that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has previously committed to holding a trial of Trump if the House votes to impeach him. “If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial,” McConnell told NPR in March. The regular rules for conducting an impeachment trial in the Senate are spelled out in the United States Senate Manual, and they include lots of specificity: When the House delivers the impeachment articles, the senate sergeant at arms must proclaim the following words, “All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against” whoever is being impeached. The chief justice of the United States “shall preside,” and the doors to the chamber “shall be kept open,” unless directed otherwise for deliberation.

3:41 p.m. Trump previews how he hopes the impeachment fight will play out in the 2020 election if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee. He posts a 30-second campaign ad. “Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son’s company,” the narrator says, over ominous music. “But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.” Much of this is misleading. Biden threatened to withhold aid that had been promised to Ukraine if it did not fire the prosecutor; he did not promise to give $1 billion for doing so. The Ukranian prosecutor in question did not have an active investigation of the company where Biden’s son worked at the time. Biden’s son was never a subject of the investigation. The Democrat’s current impeachment investigation focuses on Trump’s specific request to the current Ukrainian president for aid in an investigation of Biden, his political rival. Such details might get lost in a war of sound bites and paid advertising.

4:03 p.m. The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees announce a new subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to the Ukraine investigation that were requested earlier this month and never delivered.

8:26 p.m. More comes out. The Washington Post reports that Trump told two Russian officials in a 2017 Oval Office meeting that he was unconcerned about Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The source of this information is three former officials with knowledge of the matter.

The fallout from a whistleblower’s complaint about Trump’s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky played out on Capitol Hill, Twitter and television Friday, as the number of Democrats supporting the impeachment inquiry launched by Pelosi continued to grow.

Meanwhile, more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials signed a statement supporting an impeachment inquiry based on Trump’s pressing Zelensky during their July call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden.

7:40 p.m.: Amodei denies supporting impeachment after comments signaling openness to inquiry

Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) on Friday denied supporting impeachment after signaling openness to an inquiry earlier in the day.

Instead, he said, he agreed with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-Nev.) statement to local media that “we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here.”

“In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,” Amodei said in a statement.

AD

Amodei told reporters on a conference call Friday that he was not yet convinced Trump broke the law but said, “Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

AD

Amodei said he has reviewed the White House readout of the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as the whistleblower complaint, and called the documents “something to discuss.”

“No part of my process will be political,” he said. “If you broke the law, there are consequences for that.”

AD

This is the closest a current House Republican has come to supporting the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a frequent Trump critic who called for the president’s impeachment before he left the GOP on July 4, also supports the impeachment inquiry. Currently all but 11 Democrats in the House support the decision to move forward with the investigation.

Amodei took issue with the reactions to the Nevada Independent’s report that stated, “Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House’s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line.”

AD

“Anyone who reads Mr. [Humberto] Sanchez’s article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out — as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned — is simply, individual fantasy,” Amodei said in his statement Friday evening.

AD

Jon Ralston, the Independent’s editor, tweeted that he was not surprised media “leapt” on the paper’s story and called Amodei’s pushback “hypersensitivity.”

“Amodei wants the inquiry/investigation/probe to continue before he makes up his mind,” he wrote.

6:55 p.m.: House Intelligence Committee to hold closed briefing with Atkinson next Friday

6:35 p.m.: Pelosi tells Democratic colleagues Trump’s actions indicate ‘disregard’ for national security, election integrity and oath of office

The House speaker told Democratic colleagues Friday evening that Trump’s much-scrutinized phone call with Zelensky indicated the president’s “disregard” for national security, the integrity of elections and his oath of office. Facts revealed this week call for an impeachment inquiry, she said.

“I have always said that any decision we make would be based on a review of the facts and the oath that we take,” Pelosi wrote. “I have also said that when the facts warranted it, we would be ready to proceed.”

AD

The speaker lamented a “sad time for our country,” saying, “None of us has come to Congress to impeach a president.”

But Trump’s efforts to use his position to solicit foreign meddling in U.S. elections represent a “profound national security concern” because they put the president’s personal interests before those of the country and its closest partners, Pelosi wrote.

She pointed to the whistleblower complaint that led to public revelations about the phone call and acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony that the intelligence community’s most important task is protecting the U.S. election system.

She said Democratic House members would be included in conference calls during the two-week break that begins this weekend.

5:10 p.m.: Amodei becomes first current GOP House member to signal support for impeachment inquiry

Nevada’s only Republican congressman indicated Friday that he would consider voting in favor of impeaching Trump if the facts bore it out after the House finishes its investigation.

“Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” Rep. Mark Amodei told reporters on a conference call, according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

5 p.m.: RNC launching massive ad campaign off impeachment inquiry

The Republican National Committee announced Friday it is launching a $10 million effort to run television and online ads targeting vulnerable House Democrats over their stance on launching an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The ads will begin airing Sunday in 25 to 50 House districts, according to RNC officials. They added that the RNC has not purchased a TV ad in eight years.

One TV ad released by the committee attacks Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), who unseated a Republican incumbent in 2018 in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, for siding with “the radicals for endless investigations of President Trump, wasting our tax dollars.”

The RNC has amassed a record-breaking war chest since Trump’s election, with the help of the president’s fundraising prowess.

4:20 p.m.: Top House committees subpoena Secretary of State Pompeo over Ukraine

Leaders of top House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Friday for documents related to their investigation into President Trump and his asking Ukraine to investigate a possible 2020 political opponent.

They also alerted Pompeo in a separate letter that they have scheduled depositions beginning next week with five State Department officials, beginning Tuesday with former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie “Masha” Yovanovitch, whom Trump disparaged during his phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in July.

The letters were signed by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).

“The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,” the chairmen wrote.

Documents requested from Pompeo include a list of any State Department officials involved in the controversial July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president as well as any correspondence since Trump’s inauguration about investigations that refer to Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings — the natural gas company the former vice president’s son worked for, among others.

In addition to Yovanovitch, the chairmen have scheduled hearings with:

● Kurt Volker, U.S. special representative to Ukraine who met with Rudolph W. Giuliani and agreed to connect him with Andrey Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky.

● George Kent, a career Foreign Service officer, is deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, overseeing policy toward Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018.

● T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department counselor who was named in the whistleblower complaint as the State official who listened in on the Trump-Zelensky call.

● Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who Giuliani said he briefed on his conversations with Ukrainians.

3:45 p.m.: Senate Republicans signal they’ll hold a trial if House votes to impeach

If at the end of the impeachment investigation the House votes to impeach President Trump, it will trigger a trial in the Senate to determine whether to convict the president.

Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have been critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to move forward with impeachment, but no one has suggested that the Senate wouldn’t hold a trial.

“If they impeach, it has to be, we have to have a trial,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.)

Asked if it’s possible that the Senate would seek to change the rules to eliminate a trial, Lankford said, “No one I’ve talked to has even implied to me at all, let’s go change the rules so we don’t have to deal with this.”

“I would not support just walking away saying let’s do a rule change so we don’t do this,” he added.

In March, McConnell told NPR that if the House impeached Trump he’d hold a trial in the Senate, but he hasn’t commented on that since Pelosi announced the inquiry on Tuesday.

“If it were to happen, the Senate has no choice,” McConnell said then. “If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into trial.”

When asked if McConnell stands by that, his spokesman Doug Andres said, “I have nothing to add to the Leader’s comments from March.”

3 p.m.: Schiff: ‘It’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead.’

The House Intelligence Committee chairman wouldn’t offer details Friday about next steps for the impeachment inquiry, but he said committee members are going to be busy.

“I don’t want to comment about any specifics, but I can tell you it’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead,” Schiff told reporters. “We’re going to be trying to schedule hearings, witness interviews. We’ll be working on subpoenas and document requests. We’ll be busy.”

If the White House stonewalls, he said, “they’ll just strengthen the case on obstruction.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, suggested a lot of work could get done in the next weeks. “The Speaker’s made it very clear that we are not to let momentum drop in these two weeks,” he said.

Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier (Calif.), another member of the panel, said next steps will include speaking to Rudolph W. Giuliani and the whistleblower as well as other people on the call.

“I think that we are going to want to interview persons that were engaged in what is clearly a scheme. This is not a one-off. This is not just a phone call. This is a scheme that was hatched some time ago, and you can see evidence of it dating back to 2018,” Speier said. “And I want to see us come up with that timeline, because this is a truly corrupt undertaking.”

But Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), asked whether the House will seek other transcripts that could be on the classified server beyond the Ukraine call, said he doesn’t know if that’s necessary for this investigation.

“Assume that if he’s acting shady with a Ukrainian president who was just elected, he’s probably acted shady in the long-standing relationships he’s had with Putin and MBS, particularly over Khashoggi,” Swalwell said, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by his initials. “He said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it. We have him holding the weapon now and it’s a question of whether he is right about who we are as Americans. I think he’s wrong, and I don’t think we need to go interview a thousand witnesses when he’s copped to it.”

2:30 p.m.: House committees request documents on delay of Ukraine military aid

Two powerful committees that oversee the federal budget and spending have requested from the White House a timeline and relevant documents that explain how the United States came to withhold almost $4oo million in military aid to Ukraine.

Central to the committees’ concerns are reports that the Office of Management and Budget was responsible for relaying to the State Department and the Pentagon President Trump’s order to hold back the funds to Ukraine.

“As reports continue to emerge, we have deepening concerns that OMB continues to demonstrate a pattern of impeding agencies’ ability to use their enacted appropriations,” wrote House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), in a joint letter to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and OMB Acting Director Russell Vought.

The Democrats have asked OMB to answer a list of questions, including when the White House first instructed the other agencies to withhold the money, and to provide documentation showing “the factual, legal, and policy bases upon which these actions were taken.”

2:05 p.m.: Senate Democrats involve Trump judicial nominee in Ukraine controversy

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats want one of Trump’s judicial nominees to the federal bench to disclose what he knew about Trump’s call with Zelensky and the subsequent whistleblower complaint.

Steven Menashi, a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, is currently working as White House associate counsel. During his confirmation hearing earlier this month he enraged Democrats and some Republicans by refusing to disclose basic details about his work at the White House.

The 10 Democrats on the panel, led by ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), sent a letter to Menashi on Friday requesting information about any work he’s done related to the Ukraine matter.

“We write to inquire about your knowledge of or involvement with any of the events related to a telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25, 2019, or a whistleblower complaint about that call and efforts to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming 2020 U.S. election,” they wrote.

1:35 p.m.: Schiff highlights statement signed by national security officials

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to highlight the statement signed by more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

“The consensus of national security experts is clear: President Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine endanger America’s security,” Schiff said in his tweet. “By subjugating the national interest to his own political interest, Trump has shown he is incapable and unwilling to fulfill his oath of office.”

12:50 p.m.: White House hopeful Gabbard drops opposition to impeachment inquiry

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), the last of the 2020 Democratic White House hopefuls to oppose an impeachment inquiry, announced a change of position Friday.

“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already divided country,” Gabbard said in a statement. “However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.”

12:30 p.m.: Former senator Flake: ‘not a lot of love for this president’

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) elaborated Friday on his claim a day before that at least 35 Republican senators would vote for Trump’s impeachment if they could do so privately.

“Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons realizes that there’s not a lot of love for the president,” Flake said during an interview with NPR. “There’s a lot of fear of what it means to go against the president.”

Flake made his initial assessment Thursday at the Texas Tribune Festival.

Speaking to NPR, he added that he himself considers impeachment a bad idea.

“I’m not a fan of the president,” Flake said. “I hope that he’s not reelected next year. But I worry that this, in a very divided country, will divide it even further. So I’d rather defeat the president the old-fashioned way, at the ballot box.”

12:15 p.m.: Ukraine lawmakers seek new probes into allegations at ‘epicenter’ of U.S. political battles

Lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch probes into some of the same allegations at the heart of the Trump administration’s dirt-digging efforts, including possibly reopening inquiries into the Ukrainian natural gas firm with connections to Hunter Biden.

The Ukraine push, however, could draw the country deeper into Washington’s whistleblower battles even as its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, tries to tread a careful path with one of its most important allies.

A separate probe by Ukraine also has the potential to add fuel to White House efforts to fire up President Trump’s base and lend legitimacy to his demands for Ukrainian prosecutors to look again at corruption allegations against Hunter Biden, despite no evidence of wrongdoing related to his work in Ukraine.

11:25 a.m.: Trump says all foreign leader calls are endangered

Trump returned to Twitter late Friday morning to argue that Democrats are jeopardizing all calls between U.S. presidents and foreign leaders.

“If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!” he tweeted.

11:15 a.m.: House Intelligence Committee members plan to stay into recess

Members of the House Intelligence Committee said Friday that they plan to work during a scheduled two-week recess and left open the possibility that the panel would hold additional hearings.

“We’re expected to be here over the recess,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told reporters, adding: “There could very well be hearings.”

Speier said Democrats feel a sense of urgency about investigating Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“This is not something we can wait around [for] and contemplate our navels,” she said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), another member of the committee, said he also plans to spend much of the recess in Washington.

“I canceled a bunch of stuff in my district to be here,” he said.

Schiff told multiple media outlets that he plans to move expeditiously to issue subpoenas of officials with knowledge of Trump’s call with Zelensky and to take depositions.

10:30 a.m.: Cruz compares Pelosi TV appearance to a ‘hostage video’

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) likened an MSNBC interview of Pelosi on Friday morning to a “hostage video,” suggesting that she remains opposed to an impeachment inquiry but is responding to liberal lawmakers in her caucus who are “filled with rage.”

“I think Nancy understands that impeachment is a train wreck for the Democrats,” Cruz asserted during an appearance on Fox News. “She has been trying to hold back the hordes. And you know, watching her, it almost reminded me of a hostage video. I think she was blinking SOS.”

During the MSNBC interview, Pelosi said she supported an impeachment inquiry after the facts of the Ukraine call came to light.

“The facts changed the situation, and they cannot be ignored,” she said.

As of midmorning Friday, 222 House Democrats and one independent member had voiced support for at least opening an inquiry into whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

10 a.m.: Oregon congressman accuses Trump of ‘treason’

Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), speaking on the House floor Friday morning, accused Trump of “treason.”

DeFazio referred to remarks Trump made at a private event where the president said the whistleblower’s actions were akin to being a spy or committing treason.

“Let’s see: Russia has invaded the Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his political opponent,” DeFazio said. “He’s jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States. If anybody is committing treason — and I believe that’s an impeachable offense — it’s the president of the United States, Donald Trump.”

The lawmaker presiding over the House reminded DeFazio not to engage in personal attacks against the president in the House chamber.

A little later, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said DeFazio crossed the line and asked that the Democrat be reminded that “such violation won’t be tolerated in the future.”

9:45 a.m.: Trump speculates ‘a leaker or a spy’ fed information to whistleblower

Trump speculated on Twitter on Friday morning that the whistleblower might have received information from “a leaker or spy” or a “partisan operative.” He offered no evidence for his suggestions.

“Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all,” the president tweeted. “In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?”

Earlier Friday, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the whistleblower complaint wasn’t written by the whistleblower.

“Look at the phraseology, the endnotes and the footnotes,” Sekulow said during an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends. “This wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm.”

9:30 a.m.: Trump returns to Twitter, calls Schiff a ‘sick man’

Trump fired off midmorning tweets, once again claiming his conversation with Zelensky was “perfect” and taking aim again at Schiff.

“IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!” Trump said in one tweet written in all capital letters.

Shortly afterward, he renewed his call from earlier Friday for Schiff to resign for what Trump contended was embellishing Trump’s conversation with Zelensky during remarks during a hearing Thursday hearing with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions,” Trump wrote. “He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!”

Following Thursday’s hearing, Schiff explained that his summary of Trump’s call “was meant to be at least part in parody.”

In his midmorning tweets, Trump also declared that, “The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!”

9 a.m. Schiff responds to Trump’s call for his resignation

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday morning to respond to Trump’s call for him to resign for offering an embellished account of Trump’s phone conversation with Zelensky during Thursday’s House Intelligence Committee hearing.

“You engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country. And then you tried to cover it up,” Schiff tweeted. “But you’re right about one thing — your words need no mockery. Your own words and deeds mock themselves. But most importantly here, they endanger our country.”

Schiff said Thursday that his recounting of the Trump-Zelensky call was intended partly as parody, which Schiff said should have been obvious.

8 a.m.: Pelosi says she prays for Trump, asks that ‘God will illuminate him’

During a morning television appearance, Pelosi said she is praying for Trump and accused Barr of have “gone rogue” in his handling of the fallout from Trump’s call with Zelensky.

In the midst of a discussion about her decision to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, Pelosi said: “I pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong. It’s very problematic.”

At other points during her appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi also accused Trump of “being disloyal to the oath of his office” and having used taxpayer dollars to “shake down” Zelensky.

Pelosi was referring to the fact that Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine at the time of the phone conversation with Zelensky, in which he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens.

Trump has said repeatedly that there was “no quid pro quo.”

During the interview, Pelosi was also highly critical of Barr’s handling of the episode.

Barr’s Justice Department played a central role in holding up the disclosure of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.

As acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday, he consulted the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which overruled the inspector general’s determination that the complaint was of “urgent concern,” a legal threshold that would have required disclosure to Congress within seven days.

“He’s gone rogue,” Pelosi said of Barr, adding: “I think where they’re going is a coverup of the coverup.”

“If by “going rogue” Speaker Pelosi means that the Department of Justice follows the law and long-established procedures, she is correct,” DOJ Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.

7:45 a.m.: Trump calls on Schiff to ‘resign immediately’

Trump on Friday called on Schiff to “immediately resign” following Thursday’s hearing in which the House Intelligence Committee chairman offered an embellished account of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist,” Trump said in a tweet. “He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.”

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam B. Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,” Trump continued. “He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

Schiff explained later in the hearing what he had done.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody,” he said. “The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.”

During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi said she was “so proud of Adam B. Schiff” for his handling of the hearing but did not allude to the episode in question.

7:15 a.m.: Trump takes swipes at the media in morning tweets

Trump took multiple swipes at the media in morning tweets, including complaining about punctuation used in a CNN report that mentioned a derogatory term he used for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

“To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in describing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam B. Schiff,” Trump wrote on Twitter, misspelling describing. “Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!”

Trump in fact used an apostrophe, not a hyphen.

In another tweet, he took issue with a story by Peter Baker of the New York Times and declared that he “should not even be allowed to write about me.”

7 a.m.: White House spokesman decries those who gave information to whistleblower

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley denounced leaks coming from the White House, calling them “dangerous,” and questioned the motives of those who provided information to the whistleblower.

During an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends,” Gidley was asked about Trump’s remarks Thursday morning to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in which he dismissed the complaint against him from the intelligence community whistleblower and suggested that the person’s actions made him or her “close to a spy.”

“He was talking about the people who actually gave the information to the whistleblower,” Gidley claimed.

The whistleblower said the complaint was based on information from more than a half dozen U.S. officials.

Gidley noted that transcripts of previous Trump calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico had also been leaked to the press.

“These leaks are dangerous,” he said, adding that he was not sure why they have happened.

“Do they just want to bolster their own careers or get invited to the cocktail parties here in D. C.?” he asked.

During the same interview, Gidley insisted that no one in the White House is concerned about the revelations in the whistleblower report.

“No one I’ve talked to is concerned at all about this because there is nothing there,” he said. “No one in the White House is concerned about this because the president has done nothing wrong.”

6:45 a.m.: Democrats rip Trump’s ‘threatening’ comments against whistleblower

Someone laughed loudly during the closed-door speech President Trump gave at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday. Other voices spoke in hushed murmurs.

Trump had just demanded to know who provided a whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian president, describing that person as “close to a spy” and adding: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

Trump’s comments, which were included in leaked video obtained by The Washington Post and others, have sparked intense backlash, with top Democrats decrying his words as “threatening” and defending the whistleblower at the center of a new push for impeachment.

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential primary candidate, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “‘Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.’”

6:30 a.m.: Nearly 300 former officials call Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine ‘profound national security concern’

Nearly 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials have signed a statement warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry by Congress to determine “the facts.”

“To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress’ deliberative process,” said the statement, released Friday. “At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.”

The collection of signatures was set in motion by National Security Action, an organization founded and largely populated by officials from the Obama administration to call attention to Trump’s “reckless leadership.”

Many of the signers are former Obama officials. But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Matthew Olsen, head of the Justice Department’s national security division under President George W. Bush and director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Barack Obama.

6 a.m.: ‘Enough is enough with this guy,’ says Sen. Bernie Sanders

Echoing other Democratic White House hopefuls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lambasted Trump during an appearance Thursday night on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” during which he also called the president a “spoiled brat.”

“He’s probably the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said, prompting applause from the studio audience. “I think this Ukrainian business — using national security money designed to protect the people of America and use that as leverage to try to get dirt on a political opponent, and then trying to cover that up — this is an outrage on top of an outrage. And I think this is kind of taking millions of people to say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough with this guy. ’ ”

Sanders went on to say that he doesn’t think Trump “knows the difference between lying and truth-telling.”"

The gritty supervillain movie, which is the latest installment in the fitful DC cinematic universe, won Best Picture at the Venice Film Festival, capturing a measure of the arti… [+6753 chars]",Know the facts. And wait until you see the movie.,2019-09-27,The Washington Post,How not to let the conversation about ‘Joker’ drive you insane,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/27/how-not-let-conversation-about-joker-drive-you-insane/,"Even by the standards of our present moment, when politics is as often as not conducted through pop culture, these developments presage an unusually contentious pop-culture news cycle. Here are three strategies for getting through the coming conversation without ending up in a mental state that inspires you to don your own clown makeup:

1. Know the facts about movies and real-world violence: One of the reasons the conversation around “Joker” has gotten so heated so quickly is that over and over again, pop culture has been incorrectly cited as an influence in notorious crimes, especially mass killings. By that false logic, “Joker” could be the latest culprit, especially since a growing movement of so-called “involuntarily celibate” men have committed a series of violent crimes. But, as Scott Mendelson writes in Forbes, the logic doesn’t hold up if you examine the real record:

AD

AD

James Holmes didn’t dress up as the Joker nor was he explicitly inspired by Chris Nolan’s Batman sequel when he opened fire during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, 2012. Columbine school shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were not bullied outcasts or members of the “Trench Coat Mafia.” They were not cosplaying as Neo and reenacting “The Matrix”’s climactic office lobby shootout when they shot up their school on April 19, 1999. Even the attack on a subway ticket tooth [sic] employee initially blamed on “Money Train” was unrelated to that Woody Harrelson/Wesley Snipes action-comedy. The thieves who infamously forced robbery victims to drink bleach before shooting them planned to commit a robbery/homicide months prior to watching Magnum Force. There are a few movies over the decades, like “Taxi Driver,” “A Clockwork Orange” and “Natural Born Killers,” which have inspired real-life violence. However, and this is a key distinction, they have mostly inspired the specifics of violent action rather than the violent act itself. Individual pieces of pop culture, be it movies, TV or video games, don’t turn empathetic people into murderers. We know this because the science says as much again, and again and again. Even the rise of violence in PG-13 flicks (as post-Columbine pressures and the allure of worldwide box office glory led Hollywood to nip-n-tuck arguably R-rated genre films like “Taken” and “White House Down” into the PG-13 box) ran parallel with a decrease in violent crime from 1985 to 2015.

If solving mass violence was simply a matter of not releasing anything edgier than “Bambi” in theaters, our political debates might be simpler, though our pop culture would definitely be duller. (And really, have you seen “Bambi” lately? Youthful trauma for days.) It’s not, though! Keeping the facts in mind, both when it comes to pop culture we’re inclined to support and that we’re inclined to disdain, will keep our conversations at a more manageable temperature — and will make a small contribution toward keep our policy debates focused where they belong.

2. Remember that Phillips isn’t wrong — outrage is a commodity: There are definitely times it’s worth getting angry about popular culture. But, as Phillips said in a controversial interview with the Wrap, it’s something that can be monetized. For all that he’s using criticism of “Joker” to cast himself as a misunderstood victim, it’s also obviously the case that Phillips and Warner Brothers can benefit from being seen as martyrs to free speech and artistic integrity. It may be a niche play, though with a reported $55 million budget, “Joker” can afford to appeal to a narrower, more passionate audience than a behemoth like “Avengers: Infinity War,” which may have cost more than eight times as much to make and advertise.

Not all the press about “Joker” in the run-up to its release has been positive. But all of it is essentially free, and the sheer volume of discussion and the stakes of the pre-movie warnings have all positioned it as an Important Artistic Event. None of this means that if you truly hate “Joker” or think it’s dangerous — or if you think it’s a landmark work of cinema — you shouldn’t make your case. Just remember that there’s a difference between building an argument and signing on to do unpaid work for a studio’s publicity department. You’re under no obligation to do the latter.

3. And most of all, make up your mind after you’ve seen the movie — or be clear, but qualified, about why you’ve decided not to go: I know this seems like putting the cart before the horse in an environment where cultural consumption is considered a moral and political act. By that logic, you have to figure out how you feel about a book, movie, television show or album before you can decide whether it’s okay to spend money on it.

But while I think it’s perfectly legitimate to decide that you simply don’t want to watch, read or listen to something, and while it can be revealing and interesting to explain why you’ve made that decision, it is also true that you absolutely cannot speak authoritatively about the content and execution of something you’ve decided not to consume. You simply can’t do it. The power of culture comes from the fact that it can be elliptical and indirect, that it does work that can’t be captured by a literal description. It’s factually accurate to say that that “Little Women” is a novel about four girls during and after the Civil War, but that brief description does nothing to capture the work’s appeal and lasting power, just as describing “Pain and Gain” as a Michael Bay movie about criminal bodybuilders can’t come close to communicating the movie’s strange auteur qualities.

So if you want to have an opinion about “Joker,” at least let it be your own. Buy a ticket and donate the equivalent of the purchase price to a cause or charity of your choice if your conscience is troubled about it. Consider the performances, the script, the framing of the shots and anything else that helps you determine what you think the movie is trying to say, and what it succeeds in getting across. You’ll be able to talk about “Joker” from a position of real information. And you’ll be able to judge what everyone else — including me, after I see it next week — is saying about “Joker,” too.

Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage.

AD

AD

On Aug. 12, he delivered his document — a nine-page version of which was made public on Thursday — to the intelligence community’s inspector general, triggering an almost immediate clash between the executive branch and Congress.

Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment.

“In the course of my official duties,” the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that “the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

AD

The file goes on to bolster that contention with specific language that matches the since-

released White House summary of Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president and points to other potential witnesses and grave allegations.

AD

Perhaps the most explosive is the document’s assertion that White House officials used a classified computer system to hide documents that might be politically damaging to the president.

Among them, the complaint says, was the rough transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged his foreign counterpart to mount investigations that would potentially deliver damaging information about Biden and his family.

AD

The detailed notes of that call released this week show that the whistleblower’s depictions — having neither heard the conversation nor seen the transcript — were eerily accurate. The contents of the call alone were widely regarded as politically damaging to the president.

The whistleblower report raises troubling new allegations about the call, saying that White House officials quickly moved it from a widely shared internal computer network to one reserved for “codeword-level” records about CIA covert-action programs or other highly classified material.

AD

If true, that could implicate those who directed the relocation of the files and serve as evidence of their motivation: concealing presidential conduct they understood to be problematic and potentially illegal.

AD

A paragraph in the appendix asserts this was not an isolated incident.

“According to multiple White House officials I spoke with,” the document says, White House lawyers had on other occasions used the “codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information.”

Trump, speaking at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, disparaged the author of the report, saying that he was “almost a spy” and potentially guilty of “treason.”

Attacking his accusers is one of Trump’s standard tactics when thrown on the defensive. He repeatedly accused Mueller and other investigators on the Russia inquiry of being dishonest, beholden to Democrats and engaged in a politically motivated “witch hunt.”

AD

AD

Significant differences between the Russia investigation and the whistleblower complaint, however, may make it more difficult for Trump to rely on such tactics. Among them are the accuser’s anonymity, the existence of a transcript that many regard as formidable proof of the underlying allegation and the speed with which the complaint has already transformed the political landscape in Washington.

“He’ll be remembered as a truth-seeker,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. If and when his identity is revealed, “it’ll be one of those names in the history books and around forever, like Daniel Ellsberg,” who was responsible for the release of the Pentagon Papers.

Trump has all but called for the whistleblower and those who assisted him to be unmasked, despite federal laws designed to protect identities and prevent reprisals in such cases.

AD

AD

“I want to know who’s the person who gave the whistleblower . . . the information,” the president said Thursday.

Other officials have said they are intentionally not seeking information about his identity. Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, testified Thursday that he does not know who wrote the document. A Justice Department file related to the case noted that the inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant,” but Maguire said he did not question the whistleblower’s motivations.

“I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” he said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

AD

Although his name has not been disclosed, aspects of his background have emerged. He works for the CIA, an affiliation first reported by the New York Times on Thursday, according to current and former officials familiar with his identity and position in the intelligence community.

AD

U.S. officials and an attorney for the whistleblower have asked news organizations to refrain from releasing details about him, citing concerns for his privacy and safety.

In the complaint, the whistleblower describes receiving troubling reports about the Trump administration’s approach with Ukraine from “more than half a dozen U.S. officials” over four months.

But the document suggests that it was only after learning about the nature of Trump’s call July 25 with Zelensky that the whistleblower went from sharing colleagues’ concerns to being convinced that he needed to document and report them.

AD

An approximate transcript released by the White House shows Trump prodding Zelensky to direct his government’s investigative bodies to turn their attention to alleged corruption by an energy company for which Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, had served as a board member.

AD

Trump has alleged that the elder Biden used his influence to shut down a corruption investigation targeting the company. The claim has been repeatedly discredited, and there is no credible public allegation that Hunter Biden was guilty of wrongdoing.

Trump also urged Zelensky to “meet or speak with” Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to redouble Ukraine’s efforts to seek damaging material tied to Biden.

“Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the president used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests,” the whistleblower report says.

The document also cites other developments that allegedly troubled White House officials, including the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May after a campaign by right-wing media entities to discredit her.

AD

Although the report does not describe explicit coordination between the whistleblower and White House officials, it depicts an arrangement in which he so routinely received communications of concern from White House officials that it raises the question of whether they knew he intended to file a whistleblower complaint.

The report refers to a “discussion ongoing” between those troubled by the call and White House lawyers, indicating administration attorneys were aware of internal concerns about Trump’s conduct before the whistleblower complaint surfaced.

The report lays out investigative leads for Congress or other authorities. It notes that there were “approximately a dozen White House officials who listened to the call” and identifies a State Department official — referred to with conspicuous formality as “Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl” — as another participant.

Brechbuhl had joined the State Department only in May, as an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Beyond his sourcing at the White House, the whistleblower has remarkable insight into the activities of U.S. diplomats and Ukrainian officials. The report notes that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, arrived in Kiev the day after Trump’s call and proceeded to advise officials there on how to “navigate” the demands of the American president.

The document also traces Giuliani’s extensive intervention in U.S.-Ukraine affairs, including a meeting in Madrid with one of Zelensky’s senior advisers. The Madrid trip was described as a “direct follow-up” to the Trump-Zelensky call, for a fuller discussion of the “cases” mentioned in the two leaders’ discussion.

At its core, the complaint makes the case that Trump was withholding items that Ukraine desperately wanted — including hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and an invitation to the White House — to use as leverage.

The Trump administration had been sending those signals since Zelensky’s inauguration on May 20. American officials who traveled to Kiev to attend the ceremony “made clear” to the Ukrainians that Trump would not meet the new leader until he saw how Zelensky “chose to act,” according to the document. Any meeting or phone call would hinge on the Ukrainian president’s willingness to “play ball” with his American counterpart, the whistleblower wrote."

State Department investigators began contacting the former officials about 18 months ago, after President Trump’s election, and then seemed to drop the effort before picking it up in August, officials said.

Senior State Department officials said that they are following standard protocol in an investigation that began during the latter days of the Obama administration and is nearing completion.

“This has nothing to do with who is in the White House,” said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing probe. “This is about the time it took to go through millions of emails, which is about 3½ years.”

AD

To many of those under scrutiny, including some of the Democratic Party’s top foreign policy experts, the recent flurry of activity surrounding the Clinton email case represents a new front on which the Trump administration could be accused of employing the powers of the executive branch against perceived political adversaries.

AD

The existence of the probe follows revelations that the president used multiple levers of his office to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would produce damaging information about Democrats, including potential presidential rival Joe Biden.

State Department officials vigorously denied there was any political motivation behind their actions, and said that the reviews of retroactively classified emails were conducted by career bureaucrats who did not know the names of the subjects being investigated.

AD

“The process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias,” said a second senior State Department official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the mechanics of an internal probe.

Clinton’s use of a private email server during her term as secretary triggered multiple investigations by the State Department, the FBI and Congress. The bureau did not accuse her of breaking the law, but she blamed the FBI’s unusual public handling of the matter as a major factor in her loss in the 2016 election.

AD

“I’d like to think that this is just routine, but something strange is going on,” said Jeffrey Feltman, a former assistant secretary for Near East Affairs. In early 2018 Feltman received a letter informing him that a half dozen of his messages included classified information. Then a few weeks ago he was found culpable for more than 50 emails that contained classified information.

AD

“A couple of the emails cited by State as problems were sent after my May 2012 retirement, when I was already working for the United Nations,” he said.

A former senior U.S. official familiar with the email investigation described it as a way for Republicans “to keep the Clinton email issue alive.” The former official said the probe was “a way to tarnish a whole bunch of Democratic foreign policy people” and discourage if not prevent them from returning to government service.

AD

The probe is being carried out by investigators from the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Republican lawmakers, led by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), have been pressing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to complete the review of classified information sent to Clinton’s private emails and report back to Congress.

AD

State Department officials said they were bound by law to adjudicate any violations.

Former Obama administration officials, however, described the probe as a remarkably aggressive crackdown by an administration with its own troubled record of handling classified material. Trump has improperly disclosed classified information to foreign officials and used phones that national security officials warned were vulnerable to foreign surveillance, according to current and former officials.

AD

At the same time, Trump overrode the concerns of his former White House chief of staff and U.S. intelligence officials to give his son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner access to highly classified materials, officials said.

AD

The list of State officials being questioned includes prominent ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state responsible for U.S. policy in the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia. But it also includes dozens of current and former career bureaucrats who served as conduits for outside officials trying to get important messages to Clinton.

In most cases the bureaucrats and political appointees didn’t send the emails directly to Clinton, but passed them to William Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state, or Jake Sullivan, the former director of policy planning at the State Department. Burns and Sullivan then forwarded the messages to Clinton’s private email.

AD

Burns and Sullivan declined to comment. Other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter and concern for retaliation.

AD

Those targeted began receiving letters in August, saying, “You have been identified as possibly bearing some culpability” in supposedly newly uncovered “security incidents,” according to a copy of one letter obtained by The Washington Post.

In many cases, the incidents appear to center on the sending of information attributed to foreign officials, including summaries of phone conversations with foreign diplomats — a routine occurrence among State Department employees.

There is no indication in any of the materials reviewed by The Post that the emails under scrutiny contained sensitive information about classified U.S. initiatives or programs. In one case, a former official was asked to explain dozens of messages dating back to 2009 that contained messages that foreign officials wanted relayed rapidly to Washington at a time when U.S. Foreign Service officers were equipped with BlackBerrys and other devices that were not capable of sending classified transmissions. The messages came in through “regular email” and then were forwarded through official — though unclassified — State Department channels.

AD

AD

In other instances officials were relaying email summaries of time-sensitive conversations with foreign leaders conducted over unclassified cellphones.

Those communications are now being “upclassified” or “reclassified,” according to several officials involved in the investigation, meaning that they have been retroactively assessed to contain material so sensitive that they should have been sent only on State Department classified systems.

Many of those who have been targeted by the probe and found “not culpable,” described it as an effort to harass diplomats for the routine conduct of their job.

“It is such an obscene abuse of power and time involving so many people for so many years,” one former U.S. official said of the inquiry. “This has just sucked up people’s lives for years and years.”

AD

Several of those who have been questioned said that the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security investigators made it clear that they were pursuing the matter reluctantly, and under external pressure.

One official said the investigators were apologetic: “They realize how absurd it is.”

Those targeted do not appear to be in jeopardy of criminal prosecution — the FBI investigation of the Clinton email case has been closed since before the 2016 election. But many fear the results of the probe will damage their reputations and complicate their ability to maintain security clearances.

Several said they have received follow-on letters saying that investigators “determined that the [security] incident is valid,” but that they did not “bear any individual culpability” — an ambiguous designation that could pose complications in future background checks and confirmation hearings.

“It gives them a way to hassle pretty much anyone,” a former senior U.S. official said.

In many instances, the officials said that it had been so long since they had been questioned that they assumed the email case had been resolved, even though Trump routinely rails about the Clinton email issue.

Trump raised the issue as recently as Wednesday, calling it “one of the great crimes committed” by his 2016 opponent.

Trump faces impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in the wake of a whistleblower report by a CIA officer exposing Trump’s efforts on a July 25 call to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would generate embarrassing material about Biden.

Trump’s request for that “favor” came as his administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Kiev and dangling a potential White House visit for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The FBI began examining Clinton’s use of a private email server in July 2015, based on a referral from the intelligence community inspector general. Their investigation sought to determine whether anyone — especially the former secretary of state — had broken federal law in discussing classified information on unclassified systems.

Investigators reviewed 30,000 emails that Clinton turned back over to the State Department after leaving others, and took other steps, including tracking down computers and other devices Clinton had used, to find thousands more. Their investigation included examinations of the archived government accounts of people who had been in government at the same time as Clinton and who might have naturally exchanged messages with her.

Although Clinton was considered the biggest player in the investigation, she was never formally labeled a subject or target, and investigators also considered the conduct of her top aides and colleagues.

About a year later, in July 2016, then-FBI Director James B. Comey announced he was recommending the case be closed with no charges. He said Clinton’s and her aides’ handling of classified information was “extremely careless,” but not such that it warranted criminal charges. He suggested those who did wrong could face job-related consequences, and took a broad swipe at the State Department, saying its employees’ use of unclassified email systems was “generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government,” according to his prepared remarks.

A few months later, the bureau resumed the inquiry after discovering more of Clinton’s correspondence with a top aide on a device investigators were examining in a separate investigation of the aide’s husband. But they found nothing to change their conclusion and closed the case again just before the 2016 election."

The whistleblower who sounded an alarm while others bit their tongues showed that. So did the inspector general who alerted Congress to his complaint when President Trump’s loyalists were trying to keep it secret. And the public got a glimpse during a House committee hearing on Thursday of how differently this scandal might have played out if Trump's previous pick to lead the nation’s intelligence community had been confirmed.

The temperamental contrast was stark between Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), the hyper-partisan congressman who wanted the job, and Joe Maguire, the decorated military hero who got it instead and seemed eager to show he’s no one’s toady. Democrats faulted Maguire, as the acting director of national intelligence, for checking in with the very entities who a CIA whistleblower had accused of wrongdoing, including Bill Barr’s Justice Department and Trump’s White House counsel’s office, to see if they wanted to claim executive privilege to prevent the disclosure of his allegations.

Maguire noted earnestly that he was new in the role and wanted to do the right thing. The retired admiral had been running the National Counterterrorism Center after 36 years in the Navy, including as commander of Seal Team 6. He said he’s sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution 11 times. “No one can take an individual’s integrity away,” Maguire explained. “It can only be given away.”

Ratcliffe’s questioning of Maguire – which was more of a monologue, really – offered a window into how he might have handled both the complaint and the hearing if he’d found himself in the hot seat. The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation. “The United States is allowed to solicit help from a foreign government in an ongoing criminal investigation, which is exactly what President Trump did in that conversation,” Ratcliffe declared.

Ratcliffe’s hopes of getting formally nominated went down in flames on Aug. 2 after Senate Republicans expressed concern about his qualifications and evidence that he had padded his résumé. The three-term congressman had impressed Trump in July with his hostile questioning of former special counsel Bob Mueller. When the president pulled his support just a week after announcing his intention to nominate Ratcliffe, reporters asked Trump why he put someone with such limited national security experience up for such an important job without fully vetting him. “I think he would’ve picked it up very quickly,” Trump replied. “I give out a name to the press and they vet for me. We save a lot of money that way.” Trump gave the job instead to Maguire, who had no idea he’d immediately be thrust into the center of an epic fight between the White House and Congress.

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also falsely insisted that the legal opinion from the Justice Department, which claimed that intelligence community officials didn’t need to turn over the whistleblower complaint because it was outside of their jurisdiction, was written by nonpolitical lawyers. “That's an opinion from the Department of Justice ethics lawyers – not political appointees, but career officials that serve Republicans and Democrats,” Ratcliffe said during the hearing.

In fact, that opinion – released publicly on Wednesday – was authored by Trump appointee Steven Engel. Engel earned a reputation as a highly partisan figure in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which is why Democrats fought his confirmation to run the Office of Legal Counsel. He was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 47 in November 2017. As a former U.S. attorney, it seems inconceivable that Ratcliffe would not know the Office of Legal Counsel is led by a political appointee.

-- It’s also very revealing to contrast how Maguire and Trump talked about the whistleblower. The acting DNI testified that he does not know who wrote the document, but he said he doesn’t question the person’s motives. He added that he believes they “acted in good faith” and insisted that he is glad the information has finally come out. “I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” Maguire said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

As Maguire was testifying, Trump declared that the whistleblower acted like “a spy” and suggested that the legally protected conduct was akin to “treason.” Speaking in New York at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, the president made clear that he’d also like to ferret out anyone else who provided evidence of his misconduct. “I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistleblower … the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times published an audio recording of the closed-door speech, and The Post later obtained a video. “We’re at war,” Trump said in his ad-libbed remarks, referring to the scandal. “These people are sick. They’re sick. And nobody’s called it out like I do.”

-- Trump and his band of brothers have been leaning on the language of war this week. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, congratulated Democrats at the Maguire hearing on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.”

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, compared Nancy Pelosi’s speech on Tuesday night to the start of the Civil War in 1861. “Pelosi’s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter,” Bannon said. “Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.”

-- Former DNI James Clapper likened the president’s comments about the whistleblower to “witness retaliation.” “What’s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,” the Trump critic said on CNN.

WHAT’S EMERGED ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER:

-- “The whistleblower’s identity remains obscured, the details of his work for the CIA cloaked in secrecy. But the document he delivered reveals almost as much about the investigative mission he carried out in stealth as it does about the alleged abuses of power by the president,” Greg Miller reports. “[T]he CIA officer behind the whistleblower report moved swiftly behind the scenes to assemble material from at least a half-dozen highly placed — and equally dismayed — U.S. officials. He wove their accounts with other painstakingly gathered material on everything from the intervention of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage. …

“Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what [Mueller] accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment. ‘In the course of my official duties,’ the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that ‘the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.’”

-- The White House learned that a CIA officer had lodged allegations about Trump’s call even as the officer’s whistleblower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, the New York Times reports: “The officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.’s top lawyer through an anonymous process … The lawyer shared the officer’s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. … But as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that [CIA general counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood] had contacted the White House … While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.”

“The whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.,” per Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner in the Times. “His complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.”

-- The AP also reports that White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer’s concerns about Trump “around the same time the individual filed a whistleblower complaint.” Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo and Zeke Miller say that information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration:

“On Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ’s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA. John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told. In the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community’s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.”

-- Responding to reader criticism, Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended their decision to publish information about the whistleblower and noted that the White House already knew he was a CIA officer. “We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible,” Baquet wrote. “The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the U.S. abused power and whether the W.H. covered it up.”

-- The whistleblower emphasized in the complaint that he was not the only one worried. “The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,” he wrote in his complaint. “They told me there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

NEW DETAILS ON WHAT RUDY WAS UP TO:

-- Giuliani spent months cultivating relationships with five current and former prosecutors in Ukraine to achieve a particular goal: Helping Trump win next year’s election by pursuing allegations damaging to his Democratic rivals. Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family. ... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election. … Some of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information. … A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said. Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year. Lutsenko said that Giuliani tried to arrange a meeting with him two times before they finally managed to connect on the third try in January, ‘I took a vacation. I took my youngest son, I showed him New York and I met with Mr. Giuliani,’ Lutsenko said. ‘I had a long conversation with him. But this was only in the forum of exchanging information.’

""Lutsenko met with Giuliani again in Warsaw in mid-February, then for a third and final time ‘in Europe,’ he said, refusing to be more specific. Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws. But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

-- One of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's political rivals in Kiev is demanding that he release the government's transcript of the call, as Zelensky finds himself in hot water across Europe for his criticisms of the French and Germans. Siobhán O’Grady and Rick Noack report: “In a Facebook post, [Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko] called it ‘strange that the [Ukrainian] President’s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.’ … [In the call, Zelensky] praised Trump and went on to say he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: ‘They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.’ Those comments were not well received in Europe. ‘To say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,’ [said] Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.”

-- Conservative columnist John Solomon, executive vice president of the Hill newspaper, helped craft the flawed Ukraine narrative that would later be echoed by Trump, his son Don Jr., and Giuliani. Paul Farhi reports: “Back in March, the Hill newspaper published a series of stories and interviews that seemed, at the time, to be mainly of interest to foreign-policy wonks. [Solomon] interviewed Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, [Lutsenko], who alleged a startling conspiracy: that law enforcement officials within his country had leaked damaging information in 2016 against Paul Manafort ... to help ... Clinton’s presidential campaign. … The story touched off a brushfire within the conservative media, in which Solomon is a prominent figure, but stayed largely out of mainstream view. On Thursday, however, Solomon’s work gained new attention — and raised new questions about its sourcing, credibility and motivation. In [the whistleblower's complaint], Solomon’s stories were cited as part of a narrative about the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.”

-- Trump appears to be counting on confusion over the complex Ukraine story to offer a fog of false claims and allegations to make it appear Joe Biden did something wrong. The Post’s Fact Checker team published a short guide this morning to Trump’s statements — and the truth.

-- And Philip Bump created a helpful timeline of the significant dates in the whistleblower’s complaint to provide more clarity on how Trump's and Giuliani’s efforts to get dirt on Biden unfolded.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meets Vice President Pence on Sept. 1 in Warsaw. (Petr David Josek/AP)

CASCADING FALLOUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE:

-- Vice President Pence is trying to dodge the impeachment spotlight, but his Ukraine moves are attracting notice. Toluse Olorunnipa and Ashley Parker report: “Pence did not participate in [the July call] … But Pence’s name has emerged in several other contexts … The whistleblower complaint … said Pence canceled a planned trip to Ukraine at the direction of Trump, who was seeking to pressure the Ukrainians to help him politically. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed that Pence’s attendance had been requested at Zelensky’s inauguration and that his office had looked at dates for a visit to Kiev. … The vice president’s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky, and his discussions with Trump, will be key targets for House Democrats … Pence told reporters after the meeting that he had not discussed Biden with Zelensky but said that he had relayed Trump’s ‘great concerns about issues of corruption.’”

-- “The White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public. Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report: “The number of aides allowed to listen on secure ‘drop’ lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call’s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with ‘EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.’ And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak … At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials. …

“The complaint said the transcript was ‘loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.’ According to the whistleblower, ‘one White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.’ … The July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. … Once the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump’s comments, according to the complaint.”

-- Lost in the controversy over Trump’s phone call is Zelensky's effort to curry favor with the president through his private business. Jonathan O’Connell and David Fahrenthold report: “‘Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,’ Zelensky told Trump [according to the transcript of their July 25 call] ... Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him abut it. … It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.""

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced impeachment investigation that could lead to a vote around Thanksgiving. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as [Pelosi] is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-line’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’ Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee…

“Some senior Democrats are even arguing that other committees should forgo potentially explosive hearings that could distract from the intelligence panel’s work … ‘Very few hearings, if any,’ said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. … But many of the moderate freshmen do not want to be seen as rushing to conclusions — whether on the Ukraine probe or any other aspect of potential presidential wrongdoing. … A senior Democratic aide familiar with discussions among the party’s moderate wing relayed concerns that a probe seen as moving too rapidly by the public could backfire. …

“One of the first credible polls to test the Democratic impeachment push following Pelosi’s Tuesday announcement found the public almost evenly split. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll conducted Wednesday found Americans approving 49 percent to 46 percent of the House inquiry, with independents disapproving 50 percent to 44 percent.""

-- Pelosi explained to the New Yorker that impeaching Trump for “bad behavior” isn’t worth it. The difference now is the president, she contends, is undermining democracy and the electoral system. David Remnick writes up his interview: “When I asked Pelosi if she thought Trump knows, in this instance or any other, the difference between right and wrong, she replied, ‘He knows the difference between right and wrong, but I don’t know that he really cares. I do think his categorical imperative is what’s good is what is right for him. In the campaign, he told us who he was. He said that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care, that his supporters wouldn’t care. Well, he could violate our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, and dishonor his oath of office, as he did in this call, and think that nobody cares.’”

-- She’s back: Hillary Clinton is doing a media tour to express support for impeachment, starting with CBS and continuing with additional TV sit-downs next week. The former secretary of state called the man who beat her in 2016 a “corrupt human tornado” and an “illegitimate president.” HRC’s appearances probably aren’t helpful to the Democratic cause and make it look like they’re trying to relitigate the 2016 campaign.

-- Trump is writing the Republican playbook on impeachment, and he’s going with a scorched-earth strategy. Will it work? Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: “Trump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid. And in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump’s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it. … Trump’s advisers said they envision a ‘split screen’ strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.”

-- Politico co-founder John Harris, who covered Bill Clinton’s impeachment for The Post, remembers that impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity: “The week showed it's just more fodder for the ideological and culture wars.”

THE (FEW) REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS:

-- Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker endorsed an impeachment inquiry of Trump, joining fellow Republican governor Phil Scott of Vermont. ""It’s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it,” Baker told reporters in the Bay State. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to requests for comment, per Reis Thebault.

-- Former Republican senator Jeff Flake said “at least 35” GOP senators would privately vote for Trump’s impeachment. The Arizonan, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, was responding to veteran Republican political consultant Mike Murphy's suggestion on MSNBC that 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump if it was “a secret vote.” “That’s not true,” Flake said in Texas. “There would be at least 35.” (Fox News)

-- The president's leading advisers are concerned about the ""threat"" posed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and are ""trying to isolate him,"" Jonathan Martin reports in the Times: ""Mr. Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. … To Mr. Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party. ‘Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right, which is just what I do,’ he said. … Mr. Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s grip. But as Mr. Romney contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain quiet in the face of such misconduct.”

-- “Because Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes,” writes Michael Gerson, who served as chief speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House. “By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump’s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat. Because Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during [Mueller’s] investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo. But this is more of a rally chant than an argument.”

Gerson, a Trump critic, believes impeachment has become inevitable: “Impeachment may be inadvisable. It may apply a cheese grater to the nation’s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump’s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN. All of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump’s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice.”

A RANGE OF VOICES FROM THE POST'S OPINION PAGE:

-- The whistleblower complaint strengthens the case that Trump offered Ukraine’s president a quid pro quo, inveighs the Editorial Board.

-- We sent aid to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's ongoing occupation. By holding back American support, Trump helped Putin, writes Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration.

-- Trump’s impeachment need not be a long, drawn-out affair, writes liberal Eugene Robinson: “The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.”

-- The whistleblower complaint doesn’t do the Democrats any favors, argues conservative Henry Olsen: “It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.”

-- Democrats are sprinting ahead of the evidence, adds conservative Marc Thiessen, another former Bush speechwriter.

­-- The whistleblower and the vulnerable Democratic freshmen who backed an impeachment inquiry are profiles in courage, writes conservative Max Boot: “This week reminds us that there are some people in Washington who are not motivated solely by self-interest — that there are actually a few people in positions of public responsibility who care about the Constitution and are willing to run considerable risks to protect it.”

-- Americans have already seen enough for three articles of impeachment, argues Jennifer Rubin, a lawyer by training.

-- As alarming as the allegations are against Trump, impeachment is still not required, writes Princeton University professor Keith Whittington: “The House would not necessarily be failing to do its ‘constitutional duty’ if it did not pass articles of impeachment.”

Refugees gather in front of the White House. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Trump administration slashed the number of refugees who will be admitted to the U.S. next year to a historic low of 18,000. David Nakamura, Maria Sacchetti and Seung Min Kim report: “The new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama’s final year in office. In addition, the Trump administration announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.""

A breakdown of who is being let in: ""Under the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to people fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies. Last year’s cap of 30,000 divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.”

-- Matthew Albence, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, once again took aim at “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help the feds deport undocumented immigrants. This time, he did so from the podium in the White House briefing room. Maria Sacchetti reports: “Albence criticized jurisdictions in several states after the agency arrested nearly 1,300 migrants during the past week via Operation Cross Check, a recurring immigration roundup of people convicted of crimes that include murder, manslaughter and child abuse. Nearly 200 of those arrested could have been taken into custody in a state prison or a local jail, he said. Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down. … Albence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support.”

-- Organizations challenging Trump’s attempt to end protections for the Dreamers picked Ted Olson, a former Republican solicitor general and lawyer long associated with conservative causes, to argue their case before the Supreme Court. The choice might’ve been more surprising had Olson not played a similar role in the legal battle for same-sex marriage. (Robert Barnes)

­-- An undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong house in Southaven, Miss. Now, the city is fighting a civil rights lawsuit by arguing that, because of his immigration status, he wasn’t protected by the U.S. Constitution. Antonia Noori Farzan reports: “Attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because [Ismael] Lopez had no ‘legally recognized relationship’ with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens. ‘If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,’ attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. ‘Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the ‘We, the People of the United States’ entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.’”

-- The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government open through Nov. 21. Erica Werner reports: “The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it. The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- The Senate also confirmed Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to succeed Alex Acosta as labor secretary. Felicia Sonmez and Eli Rosenberg report: “Scalia was confirmed Thursday on a 53-to-44 vote. Democrats have argued that Scalia’s record as a corporate lawyer has shown him to be ‘anti-worker.’ In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by Trump as a ‘disgrace.’”

-- And the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Trump’s pick to become the second-highest-ranking military officer after a bruising nomination fight centering on allegations of sexual assault from a former aide. Missy Ryan and Karoun Demirjian report: “Senators voted 75 to 22 to confirm Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, who has headed U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the lone Republican to vote against Hyten, while all Democratic senators running for president either voted against him or were absent, save Michael F. Bennet of Colorado. Bennet voted in favor.”

-- The U.S. military’s suicide rate for active-duty troops has climbed over the past five years, a Pentagon report reveals. Dan Lamothe reports: “Some 541 service members died by suicide in 2018, including 325 active-duty troops, the report said. The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013. … Service members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon’s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.”

-- Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives faces growing Republican concerns over his commitment to gun rights. From the Journal: “Failing to confirm [Chuck] Canterbury would leave the ATF without a permanent, politically appointed director at a time when the law enforcement agency is at the forefront of the Trump administration’s fight against violent crime and as the White House and Congress continue to negotiate gun-control measures after several mass shootings in recent months. … Mr. Canterbury tangled in his July confirmation hearing with Republican senators who were frustrated that he wouldn’t clearly define his views on gun-control measures such as expanding background checks for prospective buyers and a ban on assault rifles. He was head of the FOP when it took positions supporting more-rigorous gun-control measures including an expansion of background checks. But he wouldn’t immediately say what stance he would take if confirmed to the ATF, only that he would consult with other Justice Department officials.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency formally told California it is “failing to meet its obligations” to protect the environment. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report: “Days after President Trump mocked Los Angeles and other big cities for their ‘tremendous pollution,’ EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an oversight letter charging California officials with failing to meet federal health standards in numerous communities where large homeless populations litter the streets with trash, drug paraphernalia and human waste. … California has long led the nation in demanding stricter limits on pollution linked to climate change. Now, the Trump administration is arguing that the state’s focus on global warming has come at the expense of more basic environmental protections.”

-- Seeking to fill the void created by Trump's inaction, six U.S. governors gathered in Manhattan on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to confer with presidents, prime ministers and other foreign leaders to press for action on climate change. Carol Morello reports: “The governors in the group, most of them Democrats, insist they are not conducting a form of shadow diplomacy. They say neither the White House nor the State Department, which typically conducts talks with foreign governments, has tried to deter their efforts. Their mission is to assure other countries that many of America’s leaders are still engaged in combating climate change, even if the United States formally drops out of the Paris agreement next year. ‘Every party looking at this should know there is still intelligent life in the United States taking action on climate change,’ Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a co-founder of the Climate Alliance, said in a back-seat interview en route to a meeting with officials from the European Union. ‘It’s important to give the world confidence of movement, of dynamic actions being taken in America. And it’s succeeded. Not a single country has left the agreement. No one has followed Donald Trump over the cliff.’”

-- A federal judge denied a request by the news media to unseal grand jury records cited in the Mueller report. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden’s advisers are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street now that the former vice president stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a “wealth tax” on the richest Americans. Jeff Stein reports: “The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds ... Tax experts said Biden’s embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.”

-- Some anxious Biden supporters want him to embrace a super PAC. From the Times: “Several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. ‘For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,’ said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. ‘And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.’”

-- Democratic donors from Wall Street are threatening to back Trump or sit out the 2020 campaign if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination. From CNBC: “‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive ... Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren’s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. ‘They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,’ an executive at one of the nation’s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.”

-- White, college-educated voters are driving Warren's rise in the polls. Eugene Scott reports: “The lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.”

-- In a fundraising email, Julián Castro warned that his campaign will be over is he doesn’t qualify for the November debate. From the Texas Tribune: “The email sought donations for ads to help him reach the new polling threshold: 3% in four national polls or 5% in two surveys from the first four early voting states. Castro has already met the donor requirement of 165,000 individuals but hasn't met the polling requirement — or even come close.”

Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California, said Giuliani should probably be disbarred. “We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “And frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani’s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.” (Politico)

From ABC News: “According to the Georgia governor's office, Price submitted his resume to be considered for replacing Isakson, who announced in August that he is resigning from his post in December due to various health issues. Isakson, 74, won a six-year term in 2016 and his term is due to end in 2022.”

-- A U.S. attorney whose office investigated interference in the 2018 midterm elections said he is certain Russia will try to meddle in the upcoming presidential race. Rachel Weiner reports: “‘They’re going to do the same thing,’ G. Zachary Terwilliger said Thursday afternoon at an event at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. ‘They’re going to do it. In an open setting like this there’s not a lot I can get into, but I think it wouldn’t be irresponsible for me to say they’re definitely going to try.’ … Terwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that ‘their big concern is deepfakes,’ or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the ‘actual physical infrastructure’ of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Pentagon authorized a modest air defense boost for Saudi Arabia after the attack on the kingdom’s oil industry. Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe report: “Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration’s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions. … Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would ‘augment the kingdom’s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.’ ‘These steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,’ he said in a statement.”

-- Iraq is trying to rein in its Iran-aligned militias as tensions boil in the Persian Gulf. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “Iraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout. ‘The prime minister was very angry,’ said one lawmaker. … Iraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict.”

-- Syrian government forces carried out a chlorine attack in May, a U.S. intelligence assessment found. From the Journal: “The episode took place on May 19 near the village of Kabana as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces sought to subdue resistance in Latakia province, a senior U.S. official said. … At least four people were wounded in the rocket strike, which was alleged at the time by the Syrian opposition but took months for U.S. intelligence to confirm. The Syrian government has denied the attack.”

-- The fiancée of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi is demanding that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for his murder. Oct. 2 is the anniversary of his death. Hatice Cengiz spoke with NBC News on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly: ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet,’ she said. ""Saudi Arabia was put under massive pressure, thanks to international media coverage … But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad.""

-- Trump’s privately held company, seeking to revive its money-losing golf course in Scotland, secured approval to build 550 luxury and holiday homes there, as well as a second golf course. Joshua Partlow reports: “The Aberdeenshire Council voted 38 to 24 to allow the Trump Organization’s residential development to move forward despite vocal opposition from many residents who fear it would crowd the roads and schools of their windswept village. By winning the council’s approval, the Trump Organization is poised for one of its most ambitious foreign projects of his presidency. It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump’s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. … In a sign of its confidence in Wednesday’s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing extensive backlash after delivering a bombastic performance upon his return to Parliament. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The widower of a murdered lawmaker and the sister of the prime minister joined a chorus of voices on Thursday saying [Johnson] has stepped over a line with his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit. But Johnson was refusing to change course on his language or his strategy. … Johnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled ‘Britain first!’ before shooting and stabbing her to death. … Johnson [said] that the best way to honor Cox’s memory would be to ‘get Brexit done.’ … Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother’s remarks ‘tasteless.’”

-- Afghanistan's presidential election is this weekend, and voters are torn between fear, frustration and a sense of duty. From the AP: “The Taliban have relentlessly issued threats against Saturday’s vote. The insurgent group has sent suicide bombers to rallies and election offices, killing dozens and warning they will kill more. ... Afghan officials say security preparations have been elaborate. In an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Interior Masoud Andarabi outlined an election security plan that he said has been more than eight months in the making. ... Despite the government’s best efforts, 431 polling centers will be closed Saturday because Andarabi, the interior minister, said they were too difficult to secure — either because they were under Taliban control or Taliban could threaten nearby villages.”

-- Concerns about fraud are also running high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. The main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned of dire consequences if the polls are marred by fraud. Pamela Constable and Susannah George report: “Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to ‘act responsibly.’ ‘The results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,” Abdullah said at his residence. ‘The signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,’ he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.”

He represented his community with integrity, respect and pride,” Gonzalez said. “And again, he was respected by all.”

Dhaliwal, 41, was returning to his patrol car around 1 p.m. when a man got out of the stopped car with a pistol and shot him “in a coldblooded manner, ambush-style,” Gonzalez said. He said he did not know the reason for the stop or the motive for the shooting.

First responders brought Dhaliwal to a hospital, where he was declared dead around 4 p.m.

Robert Solis, 47, was charged with capital murder in connection with the killing, the sheriff’s office announced Friday. He had an active parole-violation warrant in a January 2017 case in which he was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

A woman whom police believed to be a passenger in the stopped car was also in custody Friday, the sheriff’s office said. Officials said they had confiscated the gun they believed Solis used in the shooting.

Dhaliwal, whom his colleagues described as a “trailblazer,” owned a lucrative trucking business before he sold it to join the sheriff’s department, said Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia. Dhaliwal wanted to build a bridge between the department and the Houston area’s large Sikh community because of a prior “mishap,” Garcia said.

AD

Garcia did not offer details about that incident, but The Washington Post previously reported that he reached out to Sikhs in 2009 because of a confrontation with a Sikh family the prior year. When the family called to report a burglary, deputies reportedly were alarmed to see the men wearing beards and turbans and carrying small daggers, which Sikhs sometimes wear at their waists as a reminder of their faith’s martial history. The deputies called for more officers and interrogated the family, The Post reported.

AD

A husband and a father of three children, Dhaliwal joined the Harris County Sheriff’s Office as a detention officer and worked his way up. He was the first adherent of Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that originated in India, to become a deputy.

The Harris County sheriff in 2015 announced that Dhaliwal would be allowed to wear his religion’s beard and turban while on patrol. At the time, only police departments in the District of Columbia and Riverside, Calif., had made that accommodation.

Dhaliwal was known to have a giving heart, Gonzalez said. He coordinated the arrival of a tractor-trailer that brought donations from California to the Houston area in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey. When a colleague’s relatives in Puerto Rico needed help after Hurricane Maria the same year, Gonzalez said, Dhaliwal joined the department’s trip to provide aid there.

Dhaliwal’s last actions were ones of service, Gonzalez said.

“He died a hero,” Gonzalez said. “He died serving the Harris County community.”

Sheriff’s Office Maj. Mike Lee, who watched the dashboard-camera video of Dhaliwal’s traffic stop, told reporters that the driver-side door of the suspect’s car was open for about two minutes while Dhaliwal talked with him. The conversation did not appear combative, Lee said.

AD

Dhaliwal then shut the car door and began to walk back to his patrol car, Lee said. About three seconds later, Lee said Solis opened the door, got out with a gun in his hand and ran toward Dhaliwal. He shot Dhaliwal in the back of the head, Lee said.

A neighbor reported hearing two gunshots and seeing the shooter run away and leave in a “getaway car,” Lee told reporters. He did not specify whether that car was the stopped vehicle or a different one. Authorities found the suspect inside a business about a quarter-mile from the shooting scene, Lee said.

As a sign of respect, Gonzalez said, sheriff’s office deputies lined the walkway to the medical examiner’s office when Dhaliwal’s body was brought there. Community members later held an impromptu memorial vigil.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said in a statement that he stood with Dhaliwal’s family and the Sikh community.

“He represented the diversity and inclusiveness of our community and everything that is good,” Turner wrote. “Evil you do not win here.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Dhaliwal’s death was a reminder of the daily risks that law enforcement officers face.

“I thank the officers who bravely responded to apprehend the suspect, and I assure you that the state of Texas is committed to bringing this killer to justice,” Abbott said in a statement.

Simran Jeet Singh, senior fellow at the civil rights group Sikh Coalition, told The Post that only a handful of Sikhs have served in U.S. law enforcement. Most departments’ policies ban headwear, Singh said, and few police forces have allowed Sikhs to wear beards and turbans on patrol.

“To have an office that’s opened itself up to Sikh service and also at the same time to have candidates who are interested and willing to get into this work, it’s been quite challenging,” Singh said.

The closing days of a fundraising quarter are usually hectic for presidential candidates and their top-level staffers, who are tasked with pulling in every last dime they can find and figuring out what to do with the cash. This week — punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president — was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country’s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they’d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns — or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team’s Friday gathering as “a ‘we’re fucked, what do we do?’ meeting.”

The big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden’s team using Donald Trump’s lashing out as evidence of Biden’s electability — proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election — while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.

That’s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn’t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible — to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn’t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter — which ends with September, on Monday — he would have to drop out, deprived of a “legitimate long-term path forward,” in Demissie’s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker’s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker’s push.

Booker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.

“The media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there’s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,” says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “The entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it’s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.”

A senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: “It sucks, actually. Impeachment’s gonna kill anyone who’s not a senator or in the top five. We’re fucked.”

The likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn’t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (“It’s been the most nationalized race I’ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,” said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it’s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the “one way you can break through right now,” since ads aren’t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn’t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, “the choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,” said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. “The main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.”

Some candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump’s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates’ digital fundraising numbers.

So far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down — they’ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump’s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer — who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, and who doesn’t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get — unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their “we’re fucked” meetings. “You basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,” said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.

And, as Julián Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.

The best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week’s deluge proves atypical. “I’m not sure how long it’s gonna last,” said one strategist for a faltering campaign.

Castro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. “I don’t say this lightly,” he wrote to supporters on Thursday. “If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.”"

State Department investigators began contacting the former officials about 18 months ago, after President Trump’s election, and then seemed to drop the effort before picking it up in August, officials said.

Senior State Department officials said that they are following standard protocol in an investigation that began during the latter days of the Obama administration and is nearing completion.

“This has nothing to do with who is in the White House,” said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing probe. “This is about the time it took to go through millions of emails, which is about 3½ years.”

AD

To many of those under scrutiny, including some of the Democratic Party’s top foreign policy experts, the recent flurry of activity surrounding the Clinton email case represents a new front on which the Trump administration could be accused of employing the powers of the executive branch against perceived political adversaries.

AD

The existence of the probe follows revelations that the president used multiple levers of his office to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would produce damaging information about Democrats, including potential presidential rival Joe Biden.

State Department officials vigorously denied there was any political motivation behind their actions, and said that the reviews of retroactively classified emails were conducted by career bureaucrats who did not know the names of the subjects being investigated.

AD

“The process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias,” said a second senior State Department official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the mechanics of an internal probe.

Clinton’s use of a private email server during her term as secretary triggered multiple investigations by the State Department, the FBI and Congress. The bureau did not accuse her of breaking the law, but she blamed the FBI’s unusual public handling of the matter as a major factor in her loss in the 2016 election.

“I’d like to think that this is just routine, but something strange is going on,” said Jeffrey Feltman, a former assistant secretary for Near East Affairs. In early 2018 Feltman received a letter informing him that a half dozen of his messages included classified information. Then a few weeks ago he was found culpable for more than 50 emails that contained classified information.

“A couple of the emails cited by State as problems were sent after my May 2012 retirement, when I was already working for the United Nations,” he said.

A former senior U.S. official familiar with the email investigation described it as a way for Republicans “to keep the Clinton email issue alive.” The former official said the probe was “a way to tarnish a whole bunch of Democratic foreign policy people” and discourage if not prevent them from returning to government service.

AD

The probe is being carried out by investigators from the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Republican lawmakers, led by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), have been pressing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to complete the review of classified information sent to Clinton’s private emails and report back to Congress.

AD

State Department officials said they were bound by law to adjudicate any violations.

Former Obama administration officials, however, described the probe as a remarkably aggressive crackdown by an administration with its own troubled record of handling classified material. Trump has improperly disclosed classified information to foreign officials and used phones that national security officials warned were vulnerable to foreign surveillance, according to current and former officials.

AD

At the same time, Trump overrode the concerns of his former White House chief of staff and U.S. intelligence officials to give his son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner access to highly classified materials, officials said.

AD

The list of State officials being questioned includes prominent ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state responsible for U.S. policy in the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia. But it also includes dozens of current and former career bureaucrats who served as conduits for outside officials trying to get important messages to Clinton.

In most cases the bureaucrats and political appointees didn’t send the emails directly to Clinton, but passed them to William Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state, or Jake Sullivan, the former director of policy planning at the State Department. Burns and Sullivan then forwarded the messages to Clinton’s private email.

AD

Burns and Sullivan declined to comment. Other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter and concern for retaliation.

AD

Those targeted began receiving letters in August, saying, “You have been identified as possibly bearing some culpability” in supposedly newly uncovered “security incidents,” according to a copy of one letter obtained by The Washington Post.

In many cases, the incidents appear to center on the sending of information attributed to foreign officials, including summaries of phone conversations with foreign diplomats — a routine occurrence among State Department employees.

There is no indication in any of the materials reviewed by The Post that the emails under scrutiny contained sensitive information about classified U.S. initiatives or programs. In one case, a former official was asked to explain dozens of messages dating back to 2009 that contained messages that foreign officials wanted relayed rapidly to Washington at a time when U.S. Foreign Service officers were equipped with BlackBerrys and other devices that were not capable of sending classified transmissions. The messages came in through “regular email” and then were forwarded through official — though unclassified — State Department channels.

AD

AD

In other instances officials were relaying email summaries of time-sensitive conversations with foreign leaders conducted over unclassified cellphones.

Those communications are now being “upclassified” or “reclassified,” according to several officials involved in the investigation, meaning that they have been retroactively assessed to contain material so sensitive that they should have been sent only on State Department classified systems.

Many of those who have been targeted by the probe and found “not culpable,” described it as an effort to harass diplomats for the routine conduct of their job.

“It is such an obscene abuse of power and time involving so many people for so many years,” one former U.S. official said of the inquiry. “This has just sucked up people’s lives for years and years.”

AD

Several of those who have been questioned said that the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security investigators made it clear that they were pursuing the matter reluctantly, and under external pressure.

One official said the investigators were apologetic: “They realize how absurd it is.”

Those targeted do not appear to be in jeopardy of criminal prosecution — the FBI investigation of the Clinton email case has been closed since before the 2016 election. But many fear the results of the probe will damage their reputations and complicate their ability to maintain security clearances.

Several said they have received follow-on letters saying that investigators “determined that the [security] incident is valid,” but that they did not “bear any individual culpability” — an ambiguous designation that could pose complications in future background checks and confirmation hearings.

“It gives them a way to hassle pretty much anyone,” a former senior U.S. official said.

In many instances, the officials said that it had been so long since they had been questioned that they assumed the email case had been resolved, even though Trump routinely rails about the Clinton email issue.

Trump raised the issue as recently as Wednesday, calling it “one of the great crimes committed” by his 2016 opponent.

Trump faces impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in the wake of a whistleblower report by a CIA officer exposing Trump’s efforts on a July 25 call to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would generate embarrassing material about Biden.

Trump’s request for that “favor” came as his administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Kiev and dangling a potential White House visit for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The FBI began examining Clinton’s use of a private email server in July 2015, based on a referral from the intelligence community inspector general. Their investigation sought to determine whether anyone — especially the former secretary of state — had broken federal law in discussing classified information on unclassified systems.

Investigators reviewed 30,000 emails that Clinton turned back over to the State Department after leaving others, and took other steps, including tracking down computers and other devices Clinton had used, to find thousands more. Their investigation included examinations of the archived government accounts of people who had been in government at the same time as Clinton and who might have naturally exchanged messages with her.

Although Clinton was considered the biggest player in the investigation, she was never formally labeled a subject or target, and investigators also considered the conduct of her top aides and colleagues.

About a year later, in July 2016, then-FBI Director James B. Comey announced he was recommending the case be closed with no charges. He said Clinton’s and her aides’ handling of classified information was “extremely careless,” but not such that it warranted criminal charges. He suggested those who did wrong could face job-related consequences, and took a broad swipe at the State Department, saying its employees’ use of unclassified email systems was “generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government,” according to his prepared remarks.

A few months later, the bureau resumed the inquiry after discovering more of Clinton’s correspondence with a top aide on a device investigators were examining in a separate investigation of the aide’s husband. But they found nothing to change their conclusion and closed the case again just before the 2016 election."

Although it was not exactly an unpredictable development, the arrival of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump could change a lot of things for the Democrats hoping to face him in 2020. On the one hand, it has made it easy for impeachment fence-sitters to finally go with the flow, making impeachment itself no longer a divisive campaign issue. On the other hand, it is a massive distraction from the messages the candidates had carefully prepared before and during the early stages of the campaign, as Sean Sullivan observes:

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact …

[T]he drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”

There is one candidate, however, who may view the impeachment issue as a possible way to get her mojo back: Kamala Harris. Molly Hensley-Clancy lays out how that might work, and why it could give Harris a boost:

Iowans know what they like about Kamala Harris. They’ve seen it on TV: the sharp-tongued, compassionate, and courageous prosecutor that leaves them imagining an unflappable black woman on the debate stage next to Donald Trump …

Her presidential campaign had fallen into a dangerous pattern: after capturing the country’s attention with moments of prosecutorial brilliance, she had seen excitement about her candidacy soar, only to fall back to Earth …

In Iowa last weekend, the roots of her campaign’s see-saw were clear: It was hard for voters to see Harris the prosecutor. Harris the presidential candidate was meandering and often indirect, struggling to present a strong argument for her own campaign …

With President Donald Trump teetering on the edge of possible impeachment, though, Harris has a clear opportunity. Kamala Harris the prosecutor is already back on Americans’ television screens and could be set for a prime role in a potential Senate impeachment trial.

I’m not so sure. Like the other five senators in the presidential race, Harris has the problem of being more or less a spectator to the drama unfolding in the House, and a prisoner to Republican control of their own chamber. Yes, she is a member of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, potential venues of hearings related to the impeachment drive and the underlying issues. But she won’t have a chance to grill witnesses as she did during the Comey and Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, unless the Republican chairs of those committees (Richard Burr and Lindsey Graham, respectively) choose to give her and other Democrats that opportunity. In theory, Mitch McConnell could create some sort of special committee to handle ancillary investigations — of the sort that, during the early stages of the Watergate scandal, made the Foghorn Leghorn soundalike Sam Ervin and even the racist demagogue Herman Talmadge national icons. But why would he want to do that when the GOP’s party line is that there is absolutely nothing worth investigating in Trump’s conduct?

As for the impeachment trial (assuming there is one), the one thing we know for sure is that Mitch McConnell will make it just extensive enough to claim that Trump is exonerated at the end of its forgone conclusion in acquittal, and not a moment longer or deeper. And traditionally, senators have been quiet in anticipation of and during impeachment trials, in accord with the criminal-law analogy of them as “jurors” weighing evidence for the impeachment “indictment,” as I explained recently:

According to precedent, senators act like jurors, making no public statements on the proceeding until after their votes are cast (in the Clinton case, senators spoke before the vote in a closed-door session, with their remarks published in the Congressional Record after the vote).

Not a lot of headline-grabbing drama in that procedure.

While I am dubious of the idea that Harris will definitely have a “prime role” in an impeachment trial or related Senate proceedings, Hensley-Clancy is spot-on in observing that the Californian really needs a boost and probably a change in the topics she is addressing on the stump. Harris’s original campaign strategy, based explicitly on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, was to establish herself as a nationally credible candidate before or during the Iowa caucuses, and then win a breakthrough victory in South Carolina by taking away African-American support from Biden just as Obama did from Hillary Clinton. Indeed, she had an advantage even Obama didn’t enjoy, thanks to her home state holding its own primary just a few days after South Carolina, as I observed soon after she entered the race:

In the sports language often used (along with combat and gambling lingo) by political operatives, one of Harris’s people called this strategy: “the SEC primary meets the West Coast offense.” And it makes sense, on paper, particularly if Harris can go into South Carolina with a head of steam and win there.

In fact, after she boxed Joe Biden’s ears in the first candidate debate in June, it looked like Harris was emerging as a world-beater whose stock would rise in every state. But her subsequent downward drift in polling, which continued throughout the summer and into the fall, has led to a strategic reassessment by her campaign. Long story short, she’s been doing so poorly in South Carolina that she’s pouring most of her resources into Iowa to execute the sort of jiujitsu that salvaged John Kerry’s once-doomed candidacy in 2004 (Kerry was badly trailing Howard Dean in New Hampshire, so he went for broke in Iowa and won there in an upset that revived his standing in the Granite State and elsewhere). So far, it’s not working any wonders just yet: in Ann Selzer’s recent gold-standard Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Harris was running a poor fifth with 6 percent of the vote. Trouble is, the four candidates above her in Iowa are emphasizing the first-in-the-nation caucuses, too, and unlike, say, Elizabeth Warren, Harris is not exactly setting Iowa on fire with her many personal appearances there, as Hensley-Clancy and others have reported.

And meanwhile, the news from later states on the calendar keeps getting worse for Harris. A new CNN poll of South Carolina has her tied with Tom Steyer for fifth place at a mere 3 percent — a point behind Pete Buttigieg, for whom the Palmetto State is hardly a major target. And the latest poll from California, conducted by the Berkeley IGS for the L.A. Times, has the state’s favorite daughter running fourth in single digits, 21 points behind front-running Warren.

Sure, this could all change again: The combative and compelling Kamala Harris of that first debate could return in subsequent debates, and perhaps she can find a way via impeachment to play the prosecutor again (though that role has its own perils, as Tulsi Gabbard showed in eviscerating Harris’s record as California attorney general in the July debate). What she most needs is a collapse of support for Joe Biden, who stands directly in the way of Harris’s efforts to attract African-American votes and to serve as a fallback candidate for voters worried about Warren and Sanders’s vulnerabilities as symbols of the Democratic Party’s leftward drift. But in any event, Harris will soon run out of time. At this point in 2008, Obama was doing a lot better in Iowa, South Carolina, and nationally. There’s only so long that she can remain a candidate of great, if unrealized, potential."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about Medicare-for-all at a town hall last week, then faced inquiries from reporters on impeachment. Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.

“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. “It’s something extra that they have to talk about.”

While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump’s actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake.

“Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,” said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. “I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that’s about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.”

She added, “I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about ‘we’re better than the other guy’ and we don’t lay out a vision.”

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal.

Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump’s conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.

Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said “I’m worried” about the process, fearing it will further divide the country.

Will Norona, an autoworker from Flint, Mich., who walked a picket line in front of a GM plant in Detroit last week with Sanders, said he worried that focusing on impeachment could take attention away from other issues.

“Our focus is on this,” said Norona, 43, speaking of the autoworkers’ strike.

But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.

“They’ve got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.

Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. “Impeach his a--!” Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events — and devote space on their social media pages — to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.

But they are taking different tacks.

Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.

“The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,” Warren told reporters after Friday’s town hall. “So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it’s important. The American people are counting on us.”

AD

AD

Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes: tackling corruption.

“For Elizabeth Warren, it’s right in the middle of the bull’s eye,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. “Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn’t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.”

Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed — a remote prospect at the moment — the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they’ve been railing against for months.

AD

Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues.

AD

“The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.

Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.

AD

“Let’s have that trial in the United States Senate,” Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. “I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.

AD

Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden’s son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.

AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.

AD

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.

“It’s very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,” said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

At a Senate hearing last May, Kamala Harris asked Attorney General William Barr, “Has the president or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?” Barr declined to answer. It is fairly clear why. He has apparently been directing the probe his boss, President Trump, has been demanding for years: one designed to show that the FBI investigation into Trump’s secretive and compromising relations with Russia was itself a crime.

Several newspaper reports have turned up details of Barr’s involvement. He has met with officials in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy. In theory, there’s nothing wrong with cross-checking the FBI’s work to make sure it handled its investigation of Trump correctly. But everything about this investigation suggests Barr is carrying out a political vendetta at Trump’s orders to intimidate bureaucrats who would defy the authoritarian and lawless president.

Barr has been prejudging the Mueller investigation in public since before Trump appointed him. In 2017, he said Mueller’s investigation of obstruction of justice risked “taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president.” Last April, he accused the FBI of “spying” on Trump, again opining without evidence that the bureau had treated the president very unfairly. (“I think there was a failure among a group of leaders [at the FBI] at the upper echelon.”)

He has repeatedly cast the FBI investigation as a coup attempt. “Republics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences, and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state,” he said in one especially wild interview. “And you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they’re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.” This is exactly Trump’s “Deep State” theory, albeit employing more multisyllabic terms: An evil cabal of bureaucrats has decided to overturn the will of the people by trying to overturn the 2016 election.

Another sign is that Trump’s loyalists have expressed almost uncontainable excitement about Barr’s work. In April, Trump excitedly told Sean Hannity that Barr was investigating “big” and “incredible” evidence that Ukraine had secretly colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign to plant evidence against Trump.

The right-wing legal community has been vibrating with excitement at what Barr is producing. Conservative columnist and movement apparatchik Hugh Hewitt gleefully predicts Barr will give “shock therapy” to Democrats. “A Justice Department inspector-general report into surveillance of American citizens based on the Steele dossier is coming,” he notes. “If indictments are warranted, U.S. Attorney John Durham will be bringing them. And a deep dive into Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma and its well-connected board member named Biden, is imminent.” Former George W. Bush attorney general Michael Mukasey, after, of course, insisting in the Wall Street Journal editorial page on Trump’s innocence, pivots to Barr’s counter-investigation. Mukasey lets on that one of Barr’s investigators will soon “determine whether highly specific criminal laws were violated, and if so by whom” — i.e., the perpetrators are not Trump or his loyalists but the people who investigated him. The fact that Republicans have such specific and wildly positive expectations for Barr’s probe is a foreboding sign.

Barr’s counter-investigation is not the same thing as Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Biden. It is not improper on its face; in theory, Barr might be double-checking everything in a completely aboveboard fashion. But there is little reason to believe Barr is acting fairly at all and a great deal of reason to suspect he is carrying out his duties as hatchet man for his authoritarian boss."

Over the past year, America’s meritocracy has racked up some poor marks.

Back in March, the “Varsity Blues” scandal revealed that a bunch of extremely rich, incredibly insecure parents had been placing their academically unaccomplished children into selective colleges through an elaborate mix of bribery and fraud. This news triggered an explosion of self-righteous Schadenfreude among upper-middle-class parents who’d been working their tails off to buy their kids’ admission to elite finishing schools the old-fashioned way (i.e., through the purchase of a home in an affluent suburb with well-funded public schools, the hiring of a pricey SAT tutor, the bankrolling of various impressive-sounding extracurriculars, etc.). Which, in turn, prompted the self-righteous children of such bourgeois parents to decry their class’s “dream hoarding” ways: A chorus of scholars and pundits observed that, even if America were a perfect meritocracy (untainted by the criminality of Felicity Huffman & Co.), the already affluent’s superior capacity to invest in their offspring’s “human capital” would be enough to undermine mobility and entrench privilege.

That critique garnered renewed attention in recent weeks with the release of Yale Law professor Daniel Markovits’s book The Meritocracy Trap. Building on the themes of his viral 2015 commencement address, Markovits’s book argues that the American economy has become grossly inequitable and misery-inducing precisely because of “meritocracy’s successes.” In his telling, inequality is now driven primarily by the bifurcation of the labor market. Under existing economic arrangements, those at the top of the ladder really do “earn” their privilege by accruing exorbitantly valuable skills and exercising them at a relentless pace. The new one percent is the opposite of a leisure class, as its members work “with crushing intensity, exploiting their expensive educations in order to extract a return.” Then, they invest that return into their children’s expensive educations, thereby reproducing an exceptionally anxious, entitled, and high-skilled pseudo-aristocracy, which is killing upward mobility and eroding human welfare for poor and rich alike.

There’s value in spotlighting the inequities inherent to actually existing meritocracy. And all things equal, it is better to expose and punish rich parents who criminally subvert meritocratic institutions than to let them run wild.

And yet all this hand-wringing about dream hoarders — and basking in Lori Loughlin’s comeuppance — threatens to obscure just how anti-meritocratic America’s elite institutions and economy remain.

Take Harvard University’s admissions practices. A recent, controversial lawsuit accusing the school of discriminating against Asian applicants forced Harvard to disclose “detailed information on [the] demographics, academics, and extracurricular activities” of its applicants, along with its internal ratings of prospective students. This provided researchers with unprecedented insight into how America’s premier university rations access to its campus. Last week, three economists unearthed one stunning fact hiding within that data: Between 2009 and 2014, 43 percent of the white students admitted to Harvard were either athletes, legacies, faculty kids, or the offspring of major donors. And white students with these characteristics were held to a decidedly less-demanding standard than those who lacked them: Roughly three-quarters of these applicants would have been rejected, had they lacked athletic skills or connections, according to the economists’ analysis. Critically, athletic admissions often function as a proxy for familial wealth and/or connections.

As Slate’s Jordan Weissmann explains:

Legacy preferences, which give an edge to the children of alums, have long drawn criticism for skewing college admissions in favor of white, well-off families. But in recent years, athletic recruiting has come under scrutiny for playing a similar role, especially in sports like sailing, skiing, lacrosse, and crew that are particularly popular among wealthier white Americans. The Harvard Crimson’s annual survey found that among the Class of 2019, 43.2 percent of legacies and 20 percent of athletes come from households that earn more than $500,000 a year, versus 15.4 percent of the class overall.

These dimensions of advantage are largely class-based (you don’t have to be white to give a large donation to Harvard, or finance your child’s sailing education, but you do probably need a lot of disposable income). But owing to the racial composition of America’s economic elite, affirmative action for the wealthy is tantamount to affirmative action for whites: While 43 percent of white Harvard students were athletes, legacies, or the children of faculty or donors, less than 16 percent of their nonwhite peers fit into one of those favored categories.

Regardless, for the purposes of assessing the degree of meritocracy in America’s elite institutions, evidence of class-based affirmative action will suffice. In total, about 30 percent of all seats in each Harvard class are effectively reserved for children with rich, well-connected parents, and/or athletic skills. The historian Nils Gilman tweeted last month that this 30 percent “is the ‘Real Harvard’ — that is, the profitable bit, the part that the aptly named Harvard Corporation cares about; the rest of the students are financial loss leaders whose purpose is to provide a brand halo for the Real Harvard, and to justify the tax shelter.”

In other words: Per Gilman, Harvard is effectively a business that auctions off certificates of legitimation to the American aristocracy’s lackluster heirs and heiresses — that highly selective, meritocratic college it maintains is just an elaborate means of preserving the value of its aristocracy-legitimation services.

Gilman’s assessment is surely a bit reductive. But it contains more than a kernel of truth. Harvard is, in fact, sustained by the patronage of superrich benefactors, not the tuition paid by its students. In 2016, the university took in $1.19 billion in donations, a figure that’s several multiples of what it accrued in tuition. That same year, the Harvard Crimson published this illustration of the university’s finances (note: The endowment is composed in no small part by past gifts from large-dollar donors):

Now, even if we stipulate that Harvard is an institution that exists to legitimize hereditary privilege — by providing its patrons’ “failsons and fail-daughters” with the same prestigious credential that it bestows on academically elite strivers — it wouldn’t necessarily follow that all of America’s meritocratic institutions serve the same basic function. But viewed from a certain angle, Harvard’s operations can look analogous to those of the American upper class more broadly: Whether on Harvard’s campus or in the economy writ large, the cutthroat competition between bourgeois strivers for well-remunerated jobs serves to lend an aura of meritocratic legitimacy to the (relatively) idle and hereditary capitalist class whose fortunes underwrite the whole shebang. As Malcolm Harris writes in his critical appraisal of The Meritocracy Trap:

Markovits consistently refers to his meritocrats as “the 1 percent,” but in a mistake so fundamental it can’t possibly be a mere oversight, he doesn’t mean the top 1 percent by wealth (those with assets over $10 million), he means the top 1 percent by income (those with an annual household income of over $420,000). The groups are hardly comparable — one is made up largely of people who own companies, the other of the people who figure out how to make those companies profitable … In the May 2018 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Saez, Zucman, and Piketty repeatedly, explicitly reject the thesis that the richest income earners owe the bulk of their fortunes to labor rather than capital. “The top 1% derives over half of their incomes from capital, the top 0.1% more than two thirds today,” they write. The difference between their less-than-one-third and Markovits’s “perhaps two-thirds or even three-quarters” is massive. In a footnote the economists add, “If anything, it is likely that we underestimate the rise of the capital income share at the top over recent decades.”

To be sure, America’s highest-earning meritocrats, and its biggest recipients of passive capital income, heavily overlap. And Markovits does summon significant evidence that today’s Über-rich hustle more than yesterday’s did.

But in between bouts of lamenting our meritocracy’s excesses, we should take a moment to acknowledge its limited reach. In many respects, this is still Wyatt Koch’s country, we “dream hoarders” just work here."

Separately, they had been drawn out of an old green fedora by three strangers in a restaurant, and together they created an ordinary day chosen at random: “December,” “28” and “1986.” That was the date I was going to be researching for the next six years. It was for a book to be titled “One Day,” which would explore whether, in the insistent gyre of human experience, there even is such a thing as “an ordinary day.”

The date seemed intuitively problematic: It was a Sunday, infamous among journalists for being the sleepiest news day of the week, and it was the week between Christmas and New Year’s, infamous among journalists for being the sleepiest news week of the year. And it was a year that didn’t seem all that historically memorable. Bad day, bad week, bad year.

One of my first discoveries involved an event that occurred in the early morning of that day, in suburban Washington. A woman received a new heart in a transplant performed by a surgical team that had never tried that operation before: It had worked only on corpses, in macabre rehearsals in a hospital morgue.

That was all I knew, at the start.

Alan Speir hadn’t had a drop to drink. The reason for this was on the phone.

The call came at 12:01 a.m. He’d just fallen asleep in the guest bedroom of his sister’s home in Charlottesville, Va. Speir and his family were visiting for the Christmas holidays, and now his brother-in-law was waking him, phone in hand.

Speir didn’t have to be told who the midnight caller was or why he was calling, or that the next few hours would be eventful. Okay, thrilling.

Speir wasn’t famous in his field yet. A quarter-century later, he’d be part of the team that would sew a new heart into Dick Cheney’s chest. But in 1986 he was a reasonably obscure cardiovascular surgeon in a busy hospital in suburban Washington. His name had not been in the newspapers. That was about to change, for better or worse.

The midnight caller, as he’d assumed, was his surgical colleague, Edward Lefrak. The terse message, as he expected, was that there was a donor. Speir was now fully awake. Within three-quarters of an hour he was dressed and in his car, beginning the two-hour drive north to Fairfax, Va., going through a heart surgeon’s mental checklist, which included, somewhere around step five, keeping your own heart steady.

Lefrak had made a few more calls himself; others, he delegated. By 3 a.m., the whole team had assembled. There were four doctors, 11 nurses, a physician assistant and two medical-instrument operators, gathered in two rooms.

In operating room 12 a body lay supine on the table, butterflied. This is an adjective no one who was there would have used — the terminology of transplantation is determinedly dignified — but that is what it was. A man of small to medium stature, well muscled, had been sliced open from the neck straight down to the crotch, and then cranked apart by retractors, for better access to the organs. There wasn’t much talking. The loudest sound was the insistent whoosh-gasp of a ventilator.

The man’s head was behind a vertical drape, not visible to the surgeons, which was just as well. A single .22-caliber rifle had been fired point-blank into the center of the forehead, crossing the midline of the brain, tearing through both hemispheres. Such wounds — “insults,” in the curiously mannered lexicon of medicine — are almost invariably fatal, as this one had been. But they sometimes leave the heart beating, as this one did, so paramedics in the ambulance had eased a tube down the dying man’s trachea and hand-pumped a bag to keep the body breathing, which was why it was here, in operating room 12 in Fairfax Hospital, butterflied.

An exposed, beating human heart looks frantic and angry. Clench and release, clench and release. Because it is sheathed in a protective layer of fat, it’s more yellow than red. It’s only the size of a big man’s fist, but it will dominate any operating room. You can’t look away.

A tall, rangy man with weary eyes and a surgeon’s preternatural calm, Lefrak was there for that heart. If everything went right, it would go into the chest of a woman just down the hall in operating room 6. Alan Speir was there, opening her up.

Edward Lefrak today. In 1986, he was already among the most highly regarded surgeons on the East Coast.

This was to be both men’s first heart transplant, and the very first in the immediate Washington area. In 1986, no one taught this procedure in a classroom. Lefrak had been training himself for two years, practicing on corpses with a handpicked team of doctors, nurses and technicians, the same people who would surround him for the next few hours in what would be a significant gamble, both with Lefrak’s career and his hospital’s fortunes.

A second team — an abdominal surgeon and his assistant — was in the room as well, to harvest the kidneys. “Harvest” is another word that lay people use but transplant surgeons seldom do, because it sounds impersonal and opportunistic, which of course it is. Organs are precious and prized; organs from young, healthy bodies, especially so. The dead man on the table, whose name was Mark Willey, was just 19.

Sometimes surgeons with different organs to remove find themselves working in an awkward scrum, jostling for position like basketball players under the boards. That almost happened here. There was to have been a third surgical team to take the liver, but at the last minute the intended recipient became too sick to survive surgery, so the liver would be wasted — there was no time to find and qualify another patient. That’s the way it goes with organ transplants — they are dependent on speed and timing, but also on factors you cannot control.

That this was happening in the early hours of a Sunday was unsurprising. Young, healthy people are most likely to do life-threatening things late at night on Fridays and Saturdays, so organ transplants often occur at 1 or 2 a.m. on Sundays and Mondays. That’s because it takes roughly 24 hours of lab work and paper-pushing to set everything up; felicitously, 2 a.m. also happens to be when operating rooms are free of scheduled surgery.

The process also involves diplomacy, a task that had fallen to a fourth man in the room, standing away from the operating theater. James Cutler was the hospital’s transplant coordinator, a meticulous man with the commiserating demeanor of a mortician, which was an occupational asset. Among Cutler’s duties was to obtain consent from grieving next of kin, and this takes a subtle skill. He must be persuasive without seeming to persuade. The decision must be freely given, with no feel of pressure, even though, of course, at such times there is the extraordinary pressure of circumstance alone, the pressure of life and death.

Cutler had been the first in the hospital to learn of this death, from Fairfax police. As was his custom, he did not immediately alert the transplant team. Hospitals are careful about this; there must be no hint of collusion or ethical corner-cutting. A wall is maintained between the doctors who need the heart now and the team of people who must certify brain death (two opinions), test for blood-type compatibility, rule out certain diseases and blood-borne pathogens, and obtain unambiguous informed consent. Usually Cutler approached this last task through a gentle appeal to a greater good: Let something positive emerge from this tragedy, and so forth. Sometimes he had an added tool, one that he deployed delicately but without apology. He’d used it here.

You must understand, he’d said to the stricken parents of the dead man, that because of the circumstances, the medical examiner will be involved. There will have to be an autopsy, anyway. The body will be opened and organs removed, anyway. You cannot spare your son from that, anyway.

“Because of the circumstances” was enough to get a yes. He didn’t need to elaborate. What he meant was that there would be a police investigation, because the young man butterflied on the table had committed an abominable crime.

Surgeon Edward Lefrak had been training for two years, practicing on corpses with the same team of doctors, nurses and technicians who would surround him for the next few hours.

Later, much later, when she was going through her daughter’s belongings, Ursula Ermert found the two letters. They were handwritten on loose-leaf paper, undated, from Mark Willey to Karen Ermert. They were love letters, of a sort. In hindsight, they were ominous. In hindsight, many things were ominous.

Mark and Karen, also 19, had been going out for almost two years — students from different high schools who had met the way suburban kids often met in the mid-’80s, at a mall. Karen was effervescent, with a broad, intelligent face under feathered blond hair. (Her hairdresser once observed wryly that other clients paid extravagantly for what nature had casually dropped on Karen — multiple shades of blond in captivating layers.) She was conventionally attractive, and a slight chipmunky overbite added a dose of adorable. In the high school band she played high and sweet: the flute and piccolo. She was strong-willed, stubborn, mischievous, spontaneously funny. When she posed for a graduation photo beside her mother, she subverted the solemnity by dropping a stockinged leg into Ursula’s hand, a la Harpo Marx.

It is tempting to call Mark Willey a Lee Harvey Oswald type — insecure, nondescript, brooding. He worked as an auto mechanic and lived with his parents, in a sullen, silent standoff with an emotionally distant father. He was desperate for connection.

Ursula was in the high school bleachers with her daughter one day when she saw Mark walk onto the field below, his eyes searching the stands for Karen. Ursula remembers the exaggerated anxiety on his face, as though he felt existentially alone and hungered to belong. A vulnerable person, she thought.

Karen liked to fix things. Mark’s vulnerability was appealing, at first.

In 1986, there was no term in the psychiatric lexicon for the infatuation with which Mark Willey would smother Karen Ermert. Today it would be known as obsessive love, and Mark checks every box in the clinical description. “Attracted”? Check. “Anxious”? Check. “Controlling”? Check. The final square is “Destructive.”

Ursula Ermert was a 1960s German immigrant who had been widowed when Karen was 12, which led to mother and daughter becoming exceptionally close, which meant they could too easily hurt each other. The years of teenage rebellion had been particularly freighted for both. Once, at 15, Karen ginned up an argument over something trivial to undergird a foot-stampy, theatrical declaration that she was leaving home. Ursula was not about to loose a naive teenager on the streets. “If you find me so hard to live with,” she told her daughter, “I will be the one to leave.” And she did. She drove to the family’s business, a dental lab, and slept on a bed in the back room. Eventually Karen figured where she must be and phoned in the middle of the night. Crying, she asked her mother to come home.

Ursula was crying, too. She said no, she would stay there until morning: “This has to hurt us both so much it will never happen again.”

It didn’t. Not that it would matter, in the end.

After high school, Karen went off to college in Shepherdstown, W.Va., but soon dropped out because Mark Willey persuaded her to. He missed her too much, he’d said. When she got jobs — she was starting out as a clerk — Mark would show up at her workplaces, unannounced. He once crashed her office party. He didn’t like these places in which she spent her days. They contained men.

It was all there in the notes, the ones Ursula found after it was too late. They were filled with incapacitating jealousy and lovesick histrionics, and in particular a suffocating need for control. Mark had evidently been monitoring Karen’s movements, day and night, and found them wanting. He’d left each note for her when she had not been precisely where he’d expected her to be, precisely when he expected her to be there. The handwriting, corralled by blue horizontal lines, is neat but gallops to the right, as though he was racing to keep up with his emotions.

I took a shower and dressed up and did everything I could maybe to look halfway as nice as all the gorgeous guys you see every day. I would just kill to look as good as them and be able to catch your eye. Karen, I’m really hurting, in fact, I’m starting to cry … Where are you? Did you go out to eat? I feel like a fool that has been stood up. I love you so much. If words could be put on paper to describe how much there wouldn’t be enough paper. I’m gonna call your house again. Karen, if you want to go out with some other guy, please tell me. It would hurt less if I found out that way. Love, Mark.

Karen, where are you? I am really worried. First thing I thought was that you stopped for dinner but I know you would have the courtesy to call me so I would not sit here and worry like this. I am always worried about you being in an accident because I would be the last to hear. God, if you aren’t okay, I’ll kill myself! You don’t know what you mean to me.

One day near the end, Ursula drove her daughter to the emergency room to be treated for kidney stones. A nurse looked at Karen, did a double take and asked, “Weren’t you here two weeks ago with a head injury?”

Ursula waited for Karen to say the nurse must be confusing her with someone else. She didn’t.

“Mark hit me,” she said later. She had wanted to get out of the car, and Mark hadn’t wanted her to. The explanation was unnervingly matter-of-fact.

Imagine the dilemma facing Ursula Ermert in 1986, trying to decide what to do with a headstrong daughter who at 19 was living on her own and supporting herself because she treasured her independence. Karen would not be pushed to do things she did not want to do. In fact she might well stubbornly do the opposite, if nudged too hard. Should Ursula go to the police over Karen’s objections? And what exactly would she tell them? What did she really even know?

Mother and daughter argued about it more than once. On one occasion Ursula infuriated Karen by telephoning Mark’s parents, telling them that if Mark ever hurt Karen again, she would hold them responsible. Mark, it turned out, was listening on an extension and told her to butt out. What followed was a letter from Karen to Ursula; it was typical Karen — firm, but affectionate. It said in effect: Stop complaining about my friends, and you and I can still love each other unconditionally.

That was the dreadful state of affairs around Christmas 1986, when the tension lifted. Karen had decided she’d had enough. She told Ursula she was going to end the relationship, and she’d made the decision on her own. It wouldn’t be a breakup so much as an escape. All that was left was logistics.

Mother and daughter conspired and came up with a plan. Karen would tell Mark a tactfully laundered version of the truth: She had just gotten a new job working at Dulles International Airport for the German military. That was true. She would tell Mark that she’d be so busy studying German that she would no longer have time for any dating at all. That wasn’t exactly true — Karen was fluent in German. Mother and daughter reasoned that this story wouldn’t seem so much like a personal rejection, and with luck, the “no dating” would keep Mark’s jealousy at bay. But the answer would also have to seem final. For Christmas, he’d given her a table he had carpentered himself, and Karen was going to insist on returning it.

That was the plan. She was going to tell Mark on the phone on Friday, the night of the 26th.

Ursula waited by her phone. In early evening, Karen called.

“I did it,” she said.

“How did he take it?”

“He said he’d kill me.” Karen was giggling. She’d felt enormous relief, and it tickled her. It overwhelmed everything else, including caution.

“Come here now. Come stay with me.”

But Karen demurred. She hadn’t taken Mark’s threat literally. His love for her was septic, but still it was love — how could he kill her? She didn’t expect to hear from him again that night, but if there were problems, Karen promised, she’d call. Ursula slept with the phone next to her head.

In 1986, there was no term in the psychiatric lexicon for the infatuation with which Mark Willey would smother Karen Ermert. Today it would be known as obsessive love.

Midnight passed without a call, but the phone rang around 2 a.m., or at least Ursula thinks it did. Her sleep had been fitful, and to this day she knows she may have anxiety-dreamed that ringing phone. In any case, by the time she worked the receiver to her ear, there was only a dial tone. So she phoned Karen.

An unfamiliar man’s voice answered hello.

“Who is this?” Ursula asked.

“Detective Lee.”

She apologized for having dialed a wrong number, hung up and called again.

“Detective Lee.”

“This is Ursula Ermert. Are you in my daughter’s apartment?”

“Yes.”

“What happened?”

“I can’t tell you over the phone.”

So Ursula threw on clothes, ran to her car and drove the 15 minutes to Karen’s apartment, trying to make no assumptions. The truth was, she didn’t know. There were all sorts of scenarios, none of them benign but some less awful than others.

At the apartment, it fell to Detective Tommy Lee to confirm the worst.

Three decades later, Lee remembers the moment as the saddest thing he’d ever had to do as a police officer. He was 39. He had a 16-year-old daughter of his own at the time, and he was worried about the fast company she was keeping. Eventually he would lose her to a drug overdose. But on this day he was just someone’s father who had to break some terrible news to someone’s mother.

Ursula gasped, her knees buckled, and she collapsed into Lee’s arms.

All that time later, sitting in her house, in the study that had once been her daughter’s bedroom, with Karen’s ashes in a box high on the top shelf, Ursula remembered what happened next.

She’d asked the detective, “How is Mark? Where is he?” Lee told her that Mark had shot himself and wouldn’t survive, either.

It may have seemed like an oddly solicitous question, under the circumstances. It wasn’t. If Mark was not dead, Ursula was going to see to it that he became dead, right then and there, whatever it took.

Ursula smiles. “If I had,” this dainty woman says mildly, with a faintly Teutonic sibilance, “I would be getting out of prison right about now.”

The call had come in as a shooting. Fairfax City patrol officer Ed Vaughan was among the first to arrive. He took Main Street toward Jermantown Road, alert for a car driving erratically, because that’s sometimes how you catch the guy in the immediate frenetic aftermath of a domestic. But the streets were almost empty.

The address Vaughan was headed for, 11100 Gainsborough Ct., was at the poor end of the city of Fairfax — a homely two-story, U-shaped apartment cluster surrounding an inner courtyard. The front door was locked, so Vaughan went out back to find Apartment 6, which was on the second floor. It had a balcony. He saw a downspout he could climb, and a tree.

Then Vaughan heard a single shot, and he flinched and looked for cover. He needn’t have. As it turned out, it was the final shot, the suicide.

Ursula had hated that tree beside the balcony; she thought it provided an excellent hiding spot for a peeping Tom or perfect access to someone intent on burglary or worse.

As police later reconstructed it, Mark Willey had shinnied up the tree with his rifle slung over his back. He’d stowed the weapon on the balcony and knocked to be let in. For reasons we will never know, Karen slid open the glass door. There was an argument. Voices were raised. Accusations were leveled. The finality of the breakup was confirmed. Mark stormed out. Seconds later, he was back, with the rifle.

That was the story line in the local newspapers on Sunday: Girlfriend breaks off relationship, returns Christmas present; enraged boyfriend commits murder and suicide.

As it happens, there was an added dimension, another stratum of pain, one that Ursula Ermert had not known about, one that never got into print. It’s there in the police report.

Rich Lieb is now 51. He had been casual friends with Mark Willey since elementary school. In 1985 and 1986, he’d double-dated with Mark and Karen a few times, until Rich didn’t have the stomach for it anymore. He didn’t like what Mark became when he was liquored up, how he’d treated Karen.

Rich didn’t know why such a feisty, self-possessed girl had accepted the abuse, but he had a theory. Early on, Karen had carried a few extra pounds, and maybe it affected her self-confidence. But by the end of 1986, she’d jettisoned the weight, looked great and gained moxie.

In the era of the long phone call, Karen was a letter writer; she considered it an old-fashioned virtue. In November, she wrote a letter to Rich. It was just a friendly hello out of the blue, an old friend remembering the good times they’d spent together. Because he was a 19-year-old guy with the requisite lunkheaded cluelessness about such things, Rich didn’t take the hint. He accepted the letter at face value and never responded. Weeks passed. Then, on Christmas evening 1986, Karen telephoned him to tell him she was lonely. Even a 19-year-old lunkhead could figure that one out.

They spent the night together. It was electric. Part of that was the new intimacy, and part was simply a natural rapport — they liked each other. Permeating it was a sense of elation and relief, as though Karen’s eyes had just been opened to the possibilities of a relationship that didn’t hurt.

Rich felt that it was the start of a romance that would last a lifetime. He and Karen spent the next day together at the house he lived in with his parents. He was to leave on a ski trip at 3 a.m., so a little after midnight, Karen left to return to her apartment.

What happened next is evident, if some of the details are not. Mark had somehow found out about Karen’s new relationship. She may have told him when she broke up with him — she’d promised Rich that she was going to — or Mark may have discovered it on his own. But police are certain he knew, because before he arrived at Karen’s apartment, he telephoned. Karen hadn’t gotten home yet, but her roommate Christine was there, and Mark told the young woman of his anger, depression and feeling of betrayal. Karen arrived during the call and talked to Mark as well.

After she hung up, Karen took a bath. After he hung up, Mark wrote a bitter suicide note and left it on his bed. (It’s not in the police file, but Lee remembers it well: It was sick, sullen and self-pitying, he said.) Then Mark loaded his rifle and carried it to his car.

Young, healthy people are most likely to do life-threatening things late at night on Fridays and Saturdays, so organ transplants often occur at 1 or 2 a.m. on Sundays and Mondays.

Madness, it is said, is a private religion — a set of values and beliefs that may seem irrational to others but is perfectly manifest to the madman, consistent within his delusional world. Obsessive love is not formally classified as a mental illness, but it is a disordered mental state with some of the same rhythms. To Mark, all his dark suspicions were confirmed.

He was a paranoiac, but he had been betrayed. Beyond that bitter truth was blind rage, unmodulated by logic. It would not have occurred to him that his treatment of Karen had extinguished any right to demand or expect her loyalty; or for that matter, that killing her was a wildly disproportionate reaction to a predictable if painful development. He’d become unhinged, a lethal player in a dark psychodrama.

Rich Lieb didn’t find out about the murder until he returned from his ski trip the following night to find his parents sitting up late, waiting for him, so he’d hear it from them first. For days afterward, he couldn’t drag himself out of bed.

He still lives in Virginia. He works in IT. He’s divorced and in a relationship. Asked to write down his memories of Karen Ermert, he took some time. The intensity of his response may seem incongruous for a romance that lasted, strictly speaking, 48 hours. But Lieb trusts his feelings, infused as they may be by anger and guilt and loss and, above all, a bedeviling regret.

“She made me want to move mountains for her,” he wrote, “and also made me feel like I could do it. She was everything I ever wanted and to this day is the standard against which I measure other women.”

When Mark Willey walked back from the balcony into that apartment, he was firing, and firing with precision. Christine, who had witnessed the confrontation, ran.

Karen took five bullets, three to the head and neck. The crime scene photos are difficult to look at. There is a Christmas tree, and beside it, a wall with four Christmas stockings, three big ones for the roommates and a smaller one for the dog. On the floor is a young woman in a powder-blue bathrobe and a white patterned nightgown. Karen’s hair is almost unmussed, but blood streams from her eyes and nose and mouth, soaking into a ratty rug and a dingy parquet-floored hallway near the dog’s bowl.

In the police file, in plastic bags, are a half-dozen misshapen, sharp-edged pieces of bullet that had tumbled through the brain. So much tissue was destroyed that Karen’s heart stopped.

Mark postponed the end as long as he dared, until there were police officers in the courtyard and officers banging on the front door. He backed away from Karen’s body, turned a corner, steadied the rifle against the floor, and reached a thumb for the trigger.

There’s no way to shoot oneself multiple times in the center of the forehead. Mark Willey got one shot only, but aimed true, and that’s why he died but his heart did not.

The heart did not stop for another 26 hours, at a few minutes after 4 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 28, 1986, when Dr. Lefrak stopped it. He placed a clamp on the aorta, signaled to anesthesiologist Mokie Shakoor to turn off the ventilator, and the room went quiet. The lungs deflated. Lefrak inserted a needle below the aortic clamp and injected two liters of a chilly cardioplegic solution. Within 20 seconds, he’d induced cardiac arrest.

Medically, the moment was of no significance: Mark Willey had long been officially dead. But when the heart stops beating and the lungs are suddenly still, the illusion of life is gone. Even among the experienced surgeons in the room, it was a gulp moment. Over surgical masks, eyes met eyes for an instant. And then they went to work.

If you’ve read about open-heart surgery or seen videos, you may have a mental image of what followed: hours of precise, delicate work on gossamer tissue and threadlike vessels, performed by beetle-browed people wearing those eyeglasses with little telescopes in them.

Discard everything but the furrowed foreheads and telescope glasses. Compared with other open-heart procedures in which Lefrak was already expert — say, coronary artery bypass — heart transplantation seems like butchery. The heart as a whole is a large, unsubtle organ, and those vessels feeding it that aren’t the circumference of a D battery are still as fat as thumbs. Edward Lefrak removed Mark Willey’s heart with a single tool: a pair of scissors not all that structurally different from what second-graders use on colored paper. There were no nurses beside him handing him tools or mopping his brow.

First he separated the superior and inferior venae cavae, the two large vessels that return blood from the body into the right atrium, and severed them. Then he lifted the organ with his left hand and cut behind it with his right, one snip on each of the four pulmonary veins that run lung to heart. He lowered it back into the chest. Below the clamp, he cut through the aorta and finally the pulmonary artery, which runs heart to lung. The heart was now in the doctor’s hands, free of the body. It felt cold, even through a latex glove.

Donor hearts, once removed, can typically last four hours or a little longer before their cells begin to degrade; sometimes, circumstances push that deadline harrowingly. Doctors bearing donor hearts have sprinted to charter airplanes, or sped long-distance on country roads, with police escorts.

In this case, the heart would travel all of 90 feet. Lefrak zipped it into a plastic bag, put that bag into a second and then both into a third. This was to limit the possibility of contamination, since what was about to happen was not entirely sterile. Lefrak placed the tripled-bagged organ into a receptacle perfect for the purpose, if not designed specifically for it. It was a standard lunchbox cooler packed with ice. A human heart now was in a container labeled “Igloo.”

The entire extraction had taken 4½ minutes.

By 1986, heart transplants were not yet completely routine, but they were at long last no longer completely irresponsible.

Pioneered in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967 by the debonair heart surgeon Christiaan Barnard, the procedure was seen as a milestone human achievement, the medical equivalent of landing on the moon (which was still two years away). The celebration was somewhat disproportionate to the accomplishment; the operation was technically not all that difficult, except in the degree of nerve it took to attempt it. But the heart had always been a mystical organ, imbued in mythology and literature with powers and properties beyond the remarkable thing it already is — a mighty, indefatigable muscle, pumping 2½ billion times over a lifetime.

Being first to transplant a heart made Barnard, for a time, the most famous doctor on the planet. But the underlying truth was that in the early years, transplant results were too dismal to be clinically justified except for what they really were: learning experiences. Barnard’s first patient, a 54-year-old grocer, died 18 days after his transplant. His second patient survived 19 months but suffered in poor health for most of those. In the month between Barnard’s first two transplants, a New York surgeon named Adrian Kantrowitz tried a transplant on a newborn. The baby lived six hours. Though there were a few remarkable, sustained survivals, for a time during the early years the average length of survival was 300 days. The whole enterprise was intoxicating and held vast promise, but to many it had a disturbing feel of human medical experimentation. Even worse, it seemed to be done mostly to massage the vanity of celebrity surgeons.

For another decade, as survival rates improved but remained largely disappointing, heart transplantation was attempted sparingly, and after a time it stopped altogether. The principal problem was rejection, the process by which a body’s immune system gangs up on what it perceives to be an intruder and tries to kill it. Drugs to mitigate that were unevenly effective. All of that changed with cyclosporine.

Isolated from a soil fungus found in Africa, cyclosporine was synthesized as an immunosuppressant by the pharmaceutical company Sandoz in 1980, and after wide testing was released into the market in 1983. Its effectiveness was exponentially greater than anything that came before. The effect on transplantation was immediate and profound.

In 1986, Edward Lefrak, then 43, was already among the most highly regarded and lavishly remunerated surgeons on the East Coast. He had trained at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston under the famously demanding (and perpetually feuding) doctors Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley, in what was then a crucible for cardiac surgeons, with a boot camp atmosphere. Lefrak missed the birth of his first child because DeBakey had him on a 91-day tour in the cardiovascular intensive care unit, finding sleep when he could in the patient recovery rooms.

Baylor was a training ground for the next generation of heart surgeons, people with immense talents and corresponding egos. In that last sense, Lefrak was an outlier. He didn’t swagger, he shuffled. He didn’t bark orders, he mumbled them. He seemed to carry himself with an air of apology. He was a man you could underestimate, initially.

There was nothing tentative about Edward Lefrak in the operating room — or for that matter, in the way he approached the business of medicine. It was Lefrak who had pushed his hospital to move into heart transplantation, and to do so at enormous financial risk. The potential advantages may have been evident — in 1986, when it became known that a hospital did heart transplants, its reputation soared, and all departments benefited. The patients’ thinking goes: If these guys can install a new heart, fixing my hernia must be a piece of cake.

But you cannot just declare yourself a heart transplantation center and expect a flood of referrals from local cardiologists with deathly ill patients. In 1986, they had other, if more distant, options at hospitals with a track record. What Fairfax Hospital needed was a track record, Lefrak argued, and there was only one way to get one. It had to make itself the last refuge of the desperate and the destitute.

Lefrak proposed that for the first handful of transplants — the first eight or 10 — the hospital eat the cost: Offer them to the uninsured completely for free, with free lifetime follow-up care.

The hospital’s administrator, Knox Singleton, was a grown-up with a grown-up job, a punctilious businessman with grave responsibilities. But Singleton had the soul of a gambler. He never did a detailed cost-benefit analysis on Lefrak’s proposal, mostly because the results — each operation would amount to a $200,000 gift in 1986 dollars — might well require a fiscally prudent no. Singleton pushed all the chips in. Fairfax would be giving away millions of dollars in heart transplants with a free lifetime service contract. For the foreseeable future, no one would make money on any of it, including Lefrak.

All of that was theoretical, however. If Patient One did not survive the operation, Lefrak was not at all sure there’d be a Patient Two.

Another hurdle loomed. Getting the program medically certified by the state of Virginia would mean overcoming a widespread institutional bias against exactly what was being proposed. In 1986, the consensus in many medical communities was that envelope-pushing procedures were best reserved for the ivory tower — large teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools, which were places with greater resources, underwritten by greater endowments. Two such places were within a couple of hours of Washington: Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, and the Medical College of Virginia, run by Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond. Both had been doing heart transplants for a few years.

To get certified, Fairfax would have to submit to hearings before a Virginia medical tribunal. This was an adversarial proceeding with testimony pro and con, a political process masquerading as a medical process. Some doctors and institutions were openly aligned against Lefrak and Singleton, including the two hospitals that already did transplants and did not relish additional competition for both patient dollars and donor hearts.

The hearings were to be public; the media would attend. So Lefrak decided his side needed some oomph. Oomph, as it happens, was living in Oklahoma City.

Crippled by rheumatoid arthritis in his hands, Christiaan Barnard had stopped doing surgery in 1983 and had become scientist in residence at the Oklahoma Transplant Institute of the Baptist Medical Center. He was still an international star. Lefrak went to visit. Might the doctor testify on Lefrak’s behalf?

Barnard smiled. He was famously photogenic, with teeth that seemed to carry their own gleam. “You didn’t have to come here,” he told Lefrak; a phone call would have sufficed. It turned out Christiaan Barnard had strong feelings about the spread of heart transplant surgery, and he wasn’t bashful about expressing them.

When the renowned surgeon arrived in Richmond, state health authorities treated him with giggly deference. The Washington Post described Barnard’s arrival as having the feel of “Hank Aaron dropping by a neighborhood baseball sandlot.”

Barnard, 63, was in the company of a sultry young brunette. This was his girlfriend, Karin Setzkorn, a 22-year-old South African fashion model. (They would soon be married, and stay married for 12 years until Karin discovered in her 77-year-old husband’s travel bag some Viagra pills and condoms. He’d been cheating on her with a still younger woman.)

This was not a man habitually given to caution or to judiciously qualified statements. Barnard’s testimony surpassed anything Lefrak could have hoped for. Gesturing grandiloquently with his ruined hands — you couldn’t miss the pathos — he informed the Virginia health establishment that given the lifesaving nature of the procedure, any bureaucratic process that denied a competent cardiac surgeon the right to perform transplants was “immoral.”

Fairfax Hospital got its certificate.

When Lefrak walked in, Alan Speir moved to the opposite side of the operating table. The younger doctor’s principal job was over. In time Speir would become one of the most skilled surgeons in the country at heart transplants, but in 1986, he hadn’t yet learned how to do them. His job had been to perform the median sternotomy on the recipient, sawing through the center of her breastbone, cranking it apart, cauterizing the bleeding vessels and oozing bone, slicing through the membrane that covers the heart, and then standing down. The rest would be Lefrak’s show. It was 4:15 a.m.

The exposed heart in operating room 6 was structurally the same organ as the one now in the cooler, but it looked entirely different. For one thing, it was huge — almost twice the mass of the donor heart, inflamed from whatever unknown microbe or whatever other unknown process was killing it. Also, it was barely beating — in medical terminology, it was hypokinetic — pumping at one-fifth the strength of a healthy heart, scarcely hard enough to keep the body’s blood flowing.

Eva Baisey was a 20-year-old single mother of two, an amiable nursing student from Anacostia, one of the capital city’s poorest neighborhoods. Eva had been in good health until early October, when her breathing suddenly became labored and then deteriorated into a strangled wheeze.

Two steps, stop to catch her breath. Two steps, stop to catch her breath. The stops became longer until it would take her the better part of an hour to walk a block and a half. A flight of stairs seemed Himalayan.

She was in and out of the emergency room at D.C. General Hospital, where doctors found nothing wrong with her lungs. Eventually they referred her to a cardiologist, who did some tests, stared grimly at the results, then telephoned a man he’d met a few times, Ed Lefrak.

Baisey’s diagnosis was idiopathic cardiomyopathy. That sounds bad, which it is, and also sounds definitive, which it isn’t. It’s weasel-word medicine — essentially a shrug. Cardiomyopathy means “something wrong with the muscles of the heart,” and idiopathic means “of unknown origin,” or more accurately, “we have no idea what’s causing it.” What Lefrak did know, for certain, was that Eva was dying, and dying short term. Also, she was poor and uninsured. Also, she was an admirable person.

That last fact was not of incidental importance. The qualifiers for transplantation do not end with ruling out diseases and confirming tissue compatibility. Also considered is the patient’s overall health despite the failing organ, as well as his or her lifestyle. Organs are often denied to people who are mentally unstable, or chronically familiar to the police, or who have drug or alcohol addictions or other life-threatening habits. The lawless and rootless and feckless and helpless are not good gambles for too-scarce, meticulously rationed organs.

Eva Baisey lived clean. She was likable and ambitious, just a few credits away from becoming a nurse. Her will to survive was strong; she desperately wanted to be there for her two children, an 18-month-old son and an infant daughter. She had a healthy, self-deprecating sense of humor — about her taste for junk food, her less than svelte waistline, even about her sudden, bewildering medical straits. Finally, she was self-reliant — she’d been living on her own since she was 17, when her parents moved from the District to North Carolina and left her behind in an apartment they subsidized.

What Edward Lefrak did know, for certain, was that Eva Baisey was dying, and dying short term. Also, she was poor and uninsured. Also, she was an admirable person. That last fact was not of incidental importance.

Being unattached was bad for transplant protocols. Family support is the final qualifying criterion, an important one. Surviving this surgery is a life-changing ordeal. No one is stoic enough to go it alone. In the case of Eva Baisey, it was a potential dealbreaker — until it wasn’t anymore.

Eva’s mother, Barbara, had grown up unimaginably poor in the housing projects in Southeast Washington. Her family’s poverty was almost cliche: All the children shared the same toothbrush. That sort of background can break your spirit, or it can do just the opposite.

There was nothing broken or even slightly bowed about Barbara Baisey. When Eva got sick and became a candidate for heart transplantation, Barbara told her husband that they had to move back to D.C. He said no; he’d countenance weekend visits, but that was that. So she moved back on her own. Her daughter had been offered an astonishing gift, and Barbara felt her new purpose in life was to make it work, at whatever cost, including her marriage. She’d eventually get a divorce.

That was unimpeachable family support. Eva Baisey was approved as a recipient, and on Dec. 4, 1986, she was transported from city to suburb, taken to Fairfax Hospital to await a donor.

Lefrak and his team might have been willing to relax some criteria to get that first transplant, but as it happens, in Baisey he had been handed a perfect patient. There was even a fortuitous intangible.

During the early years of heart transplantation — particularly in apartheid South Africa, but elsewhere, too — there was an undercurrent of controversy involving race. When Barnard’s second transplant patient, a white South African dentist, received the heart of a mixed-race man, many grumbled about the unseemly precedent of an oppressed minority serving as an organ farm for the higher castes. It was an unfair charge — even early on, even in South Africa, some white organs went into black bodies — but it was understandable. In transplantation, racial concerns persist even today.

In 1986, in the majority black but still economically segregated Washington, there would be no such issues raised, either direct or whispered. Mark Willey was white. Eva Baisey was black.

At D.C. General, most of the patients and much of the staff had been African American, but when Eva arrived at Fairfax Hospital, she saw only alabaster. White patients, white doctors, white nurses, white orderlies. Eva was not conspiracy-minded, but when she initially got much sicker after her change of venue, she found herself wondering, almost amused, whether the staff was trying to do her in so a more ethnically suitable patient would arrive. What was really happening, of course, was by no one’s design and to no one’s desire: The patient was dying.

Then in the wee hours of the morning of Dec. 28, the patient noticed an unusual number of people beginning to congregate in her room. She began to suspect something was up when nurses told her to soap herself really, really carefully. She was pretty sure something was up when they slathered her, neck to belly, with iodine-smelly Betadine. She knew something was up when, at 1 a.m., her ma arrived.

It had taken more than three weeks, and a shattering tragedy, but Eva Baisey was about to get her new heart or die from the effort.

In the presence of death, the atmosphere in the donor room had been sepulchral. In the recipient room, with the possibility of a life restored, there was music.

Years later, no one could agree on what specifically was playing that night, except that it was twangy. Ed Lefrak was that extreme rarity: a devoutly liberal northeastern Jewish urban Yankees fan who happened to have a taste for country music. As was his custom, he’d brought a cassette tape, most likely Waylon Jennings or Emmylou Harris, or both. The music was just loud enough to provide a benign soundtrack that out-noised the respirator and other ambient distractions. It also discouraged talk. Some surgeons like chatter. Lefrak hated it.

He inserted cannulas — transparent silicone rubber tubes — into each of the vessels feeding and draining Eva Baisey’s heart, and sewed them into place in the aorta and the two venae cavae. These tubes wove out of the body. The two venous lines met at a Y connector, turning into one. Baisey’s circulation was now reduced to two tubes that fed out behind the surgeon and into a heart-lung machine.

Lefrak gave a nod to the perfusionist, Aaron Hill. The machine rumbled to life, and the tubes filled with blood — purplish dark coming from the body, then three shades lighter and a few degrees colder going back in. The machine was slowly cooling Baisey down — eventually all the way to 79 degrees, slowing her metabolism — but it was also breathing for her, oxygenating her blood. Her bad heart was now beside the point. Relieved of the burden that was grinding it to exhaustion, the organ shrank back almost to normal size, almost in an instant. It was dramatic. You could practically hear a whew.

Mary Dellinger, the scrub nurse to Lefrak’s right, handed him scissors. What followed was not unlike what had happened in the donor room, with one principal exception: At the back of the organ, Lefrak left the pulmonary veins intact, slicing instead into the top of the damaged heart itself, leaving behind cuffs of tissue from Baisey’s left and right atria. To these, the new heart would be sewn. It was an odd counterintuitive procedure — why invite rejection by sewing heart tissue to heart tissue?

There was a good reason — pulmonary vessels are notoriously tricky to splice together, and this allows you to avoid it, retaining the recipient’s own vessels. The technique had been pioneered a quarter of a century before by Stanford University cardiac surgeon Norman Shumway, while practicing on dogs.

More than anyone else, Shumway was considered the father of heart transplantation, and he’d almost been the first to perform one. On Nov. 20, 1967, he announced that he was ready for a transplant, what would have been the first ever. He had a patient and was waiting for a donor.

The wait proved too long. He lost the race to Barnard by 33 days. (Shumway’s first transplant, the world’s fourth, fared no better than the others, the patient surviving for just two weeks.)

Many years later, it would become clear exactly how Barnard had won. Shumway had been limited by international ethical conventions on certifying death. At the time, brain death was not sufficient; the heart had to have stopped on its own. That meant surgeons sometimes watched helplessly as potential donors slowly wasted away, damaging their tissues beyond recovery. Barnard was bound by the same strictures but was under less scrutiny from a despised government desperate for the feel of international legitimacy. As was disclosed 40 years later by Barnard’s brother, Marius, in Donald McRae’s 2006 book about the first transplant, “Every Second Counts,” Barnard had gotten that first donor heart to stop by stopping it. He’d furtively injected it with paralyzing potassium until the donor became officially deceased.

In operating room 6, Lefrak had also injected potassium into Baisey’s exhausted heart, for an entirely different reason. When the heart was still, the extraction was easier. Once it was free of her body it became a specimen for the lab, for any secrets it might offer up to help take the “idiopathic” out of cardiomyopathy.

At a signal from Lefrak, the Igloo was brought in from operating room 12. The triple-bagged heart was unpackaged and laid out on a tray.

Unbidden, Mary Dellinger passed Lefrak a suture. She knew exactly what came next — much of what remained was sophisticated needlework. Dellinger had been helping Lefrak with this for two years, at the doctor’s side since the beginning, a constant presence during most of the rehearsals. She was one of those invaluable surgical nurses whose hand was there with the next needed instrument even before the surgeon thought to reach for it.

In 1986, the only way to practice transplanting hearts was to transplant hearts, which meant, for Lefrak, a tip from a pathologist or morgue attendant, followed by an awkward conversation with next of kin, followed by hours at the morgue, working with a new cadaver. There had been more than a dozen such dry runs. The most memorable had been on Feb. 27, 1986, the day before Christiaan Barnard’s testimony in Richmond. Gamely, Barnard had agreed to join Lefrak in the morgue. There he sat at the head of the gurney and kibitzed as Lefrak rehearsed with a corpse.

From that day, Dellinger kept several photos — Barnard, gracious with his time, posing with the doctors and nurses. Among her memories of the day are Barnard’s hands, still expressive, still usable for most things, but clearly stiff and gnarled, no longer supple enough for the thing that saved lives.

In the operating room, some of the sewing was as simple as splicing severed vessels, hose to hose, end to end. The whole transplant was a meticulous, repetitive process. Sew, check for leaks. Sew, check for leaks. This took hours. The sun rose. The sewing and checking continued.

When all connections had been sealed and the perfusionist began to slowly warm the blood, Lefrak released the cross-clamp on the aorta and the new heart began to tremble. A good sign. It was not beating, but it was fibrillating.

What happened next defied everything most people presume about the human heart. Lefrak lowered Eva’s head, cupped her new heart with his left hand and tilted the bottom of it up so it became the highest point in her body. Then he accepted from Dellinger a long 18-gauge hypodermic needle and stabbed it into the heart’s apex, clean through the muscle to the cavity of the left ventricle. From the plastic collet of the needle came a bloody froth. When that stopped, Lefrak withdrew the needle, then pushed it in again, a few millimeters away. More bubbles.

If a heart is sliced by the thrust of a knife, that is usually fatal. If it is pierced by a bullet, it is nearly always fatal. But the heart is, in the end, a muscle, and as anyone knows who has ever gotten a vaccination in the arm — or anyone familiar with the overdose scene in “Pulp Fiction” — muscles can withstand and survive a needle. They close back up and heal instantly. Lefrak repeated this unnerving stab of the needle more than a dozen times. The goal was to empty the heart of all air bubbles before reconnecting it to its prime source of blood, via the venae cavae. Air bubbles cause embolisms, and embolisms cause brain damage.

Satisfied all the air was gone — no more froth — Lefrak allowed the heart to fill with blood.

Typically, at this point, nothing happens. No beat. That doesn’t occur until the blood is fully warmed, from 79 degrees to 98.6, and that process is gradual. Even then, often, nothing happens; with the majority of heart transplants, electric shock must be used to start the organ. The electrode paddles were readied.

They weren’t needed. After the heart was fully warmed and Lefrak massaged it by hand for a minute or two, Mark Willey’s heart started beating. His heart? Her heart? For the moment, pronouns became ambiguous.

It was an imperfect beat — the right atrium was stuttering — but that soon resolved.

In an understandable deviation from procedure, Aaron Hill abandoned his heart-lung machine, walked up behind Lefrak and looked over the doctor’s shoulder, to take in the moment. The beat was strong, a young man’s heart in a young woman’s body, in powerful, controlled spasm. Clench and release, clench and release. The sutures all held.

It’s perhaps odd, but three decades later there is no consensus on what happened next. Lefrak, who disdains shows of emotion in his operating room, remembers no celebration at all. Anesthesiologist Mokie Shakoor recalls the slowly building thup-thup-thup of applause through a circle of latex gloves. Speir thinks he may have reached around the table to shake Lefrak’s hand. The clearest memory belongs to Mary Dellinger.

Dellinger remembers an almost matter-of-fact atmosphere, not a letdown or an anticlimax, but an exhilarating, satisfied collective nod. Of course it had worked. They had practiced so obsessively with the dead, there was no way it was not going to work for the living.

After major procedures, surgeons dictate operative notes, for the record. These tend to be laconic affairs, heavy on technical language, empty of drama. This one was no different, and it also reflected Lefrak’s distaste for showmanship. It was three pages long, single spaced on a manual typewriter. Under “Operation” it says “orthotopic cardiac transplantation,” just as it might have said “tonsillectomy.” After three long paragraphs describing the patient’s history, her diagnosis, the medications that had been tried and failed, the prep of her body and the mechanics of cardiopulmonary bypass, Lefrak summarized the entire four-hour transplant in one sentence: “The donor heart was sutured in place using the standardized technique.” Like a successful fisherman giving credit to his line, he then notes the sutures were made with “3-0 Prolene.” Finally: “The patient was taken to the surgical intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.”

Three decades later, Lefrak, now 76, is a few years into his retirement.

He and his wife, Trudy, have five adult daughters. The Lefraks live in one of the grandest homes in stately McLean, Va. It’s a mansion on a hill, a feat of modern architecture and design in which much of the furniture and infrastructure look as though they were carved out of the same enormous tree.

Unlike Christiaan Barnard, Ed Lefrak had an unforced retirement. His hands are fine. He uses them to resew his granddaughters’ loved-ragged stuffed toys, and sometimes hauls out the surgical spectacles with those little telescopes to untangle his wife’s necklaces. Once a month, he and Trudy — a registered nurse — volunteer their time at a free medical clinic in Arlington, Va., treating the uninsured for problems as plebeian as hemorrhoids.

Lefrak is one of those rare and lucky individuals whose personal fortune allows the sort of generosity of spirit we all like to think we’d show if we just had the resources. Most of us are never tested on this. For those who are, the rewards can be complicated.

In 1998, Lefrak was part of a medical team that volunteered to care for Nicaraguan peasants after Hurricane Mitch nearly annihilated the country, killing thousands, displacing hundreds of thousands, destroying hospitals, distributing willy-nilly through the floodwaters thousands of active land mines left over from the Contra insurgency of the 1980s. Many lives and limbs were lost.

In Corinto, a poor coastal city ravaged by flooding, Lefrak found himself moved by the plight of a sickly 14-year-old girl, one hardship in all the rubble that was not wrought by Mitch. The mitral valve in Maria Eliset Centeno Hernandez’s heart had been damaged from a bout with rheumatic fever at age 9. Her lungs were bubbly with blood, her breathing shallow and liquid. Lefrak knew what lay in store for her — a lingering death in her 20s, if she even made it that far, considering her straits. Orphaned at an early age, Maria lived with her doting grandmother and disabled brother in a leaky tin-roofed shack without electricity or running water. Dinner was sometimes bread and coffee.

Working with an international charity organization, Lefrak brought Maria to Virginia, put her up for a few weeks in his palatial home and then, in a grueling day-long surgery, sliced open her heart and gave it a new valve. All of it was a gift — from Lefrak, his colleagues and his hospital.

Before the operation, Maria could barely move. A week afterward, she was rollerblading around the Lefraks’ home and bonding with 10-year-old Mikaela, the youngest Lefrak daughter. Her suitcases fat with new clothes and toys, Maria returned with boundless joy and reckless energy to the reality that awaited her in the dispiriting grit of Corinto, Nicaragua — population 15,000.

Was it too much, too fast, with hope too easily extinguished? Eighteen months later, Maria was pregnant. Six years later, she was dead. Lefrak doesn’t know what took her. On his desk, he keeps a picture of Maria, and of her two children, a boy and a girl. The boy’s middle name is Eduardo, named for the doctor who had saved the mother’s life.

When Lefrak closes his eyes, he still sees Maria at 14, copper-skinned, dimply, joyful, with a cereal-bowl haircut, looking like a little girl but for her strangely complex grown-up eyes.

Eva Baisey is one of the longest-living heart transplant patients on the planet.

Fairfax Hospital — now called Inova Fairfax — has become one of the leading heart transplant centers in the country. Its chief cardiac surgeon is Alan Speir.

Heart transplantation is now close to commonplace, with more than 2,000 a year performed in the United States alone. It extends life but is not without problems, still. For reasons that are not yet clear, transplant recipients tend to develop coronary artery disease more rapidly than most people. Transplant survival rates, while vastly better than before, are still not extraordinary. Only half survive for 10 years or more. Fifteen years is considered excellent. Twenty is remarkable. Twenty-five is nearly unheard of. Also, for unknown reasons, survival rates for black patients are significantly lower than for white patients.

What, then, explains Eva Baisey, here in her living room, three decades after her surgery, one of the longest-living transplant patients on the planet, joking about how she sometimes forgets to take her meds?

“I don’t always take cyclosporine twice a day like I’m supposed to,” she says in a conspiratorial whisper. “I’ll remember after three or four days when I feel a little flutter or it skips a beat.”

Eva considers what this must sound like. A big smile.

“Don’t tell Dr. Lefrak. He’ll kill me.”

She and Lefrak remain friends. He calls her every Dec. 28, every anniversary of the surgery that saved her life. He has done it 32 times.

Eva Baisey is a formidable presence, with long, striking purplish braids woven by her daughter. She is in a perpetual happy battle with her weight, something she talks about a lot. What she doesn’t talk about much are the events of Christmas week 1986.

When she woke after surgery, Eva asked her ICU nurse to see the Sunday newspaper. The nurse laughed. Sunday was history; Eva had slept clear through it. So the nurse handed Eva the Monday Washington Post. She was on Page 1.

Soon Eva would get the bad news: She could not be a nurse. Her compromised immune system made it too dangerous for her to be around the sick. She was crushed by this; ever since childhood, all she’d wanted to do, she said, was to “help old people and babies.” So for a time she studied computer science and worked with those machines, though, as she puts it now without irony, “my heart wasn’t in it.”

After five years, Eva’s immune system seemed fine and her doctors relented. She was cleared to be a nurse, and that’s what she is. She helps old people and babies. She lives in a nice garden apartment in District Heights, Md., not far from her son and her daughter, a security guard, and her mom, Barbara, who still has her back.

Eva says that in the black community, there is still some mistrust about donating organs, a suspicion that for African Americans the transplant business is a one-way street in the wrong direction. She tries to dispel that notion wherever and whenever she can.

Nothing convincingly explains the strange chemistry, the alchemy, that has kept the heart of a sullen, violent, tormented criminal beating for so long in a gentle mother’s chest.

Doctors working with transplant patients have noticed that many of them tend to be incurious about the lives of the people whose hearts beat in their chest, or the circumstances of their deaths. It’s not ingratitude — it’s a form of self-defense. There is a burden in merely surviving this surgery and remaining optimistic, and it does not help to incorporate someone else’s tragedy into the narrative of your life.

Eva’s like that. It has helped her to think of her new heart as a thing, more like a prosthetic device than a part from another human being. She knew about the source of her new heart and the murder, of course — it, too, was in the newspapers — but she never asked about the details, didn’t really want details, and did not hear them until this very day.

Taking this all in is Eva’s son, Antonio, who was not yet 2 at the time of the operation. Antonio is a slight, elegant, soft-spoken young man, who is politically liberal but once worked as a waiter in a Republican country club. He held his tongue at work and suppresses a smile about that. Antonio has stayed quiet, too, for most of the last two hours, listening to the story of his mother’s deteriorating illness, her near death, and of the murder-suicide that saved her life.

“This is the first time I’ve heard a lot of this,” he says, shaking his head.

Doctors tend not to speculate why one transplant works so well and others do not. Surely it helped that Mark Willey’s heart was fresh, that it had spent only minutes outside his body when it went into Eva’s. But hundreds of down-the-hall transplants haven’t been nearly as successful as this one. Other donors have been in better physical shape than Mark, other recipients in better physical shape than Eva. Nothing convincingly explains the strange chemistry, the alchemy, that has kept the heart of a sullen, violent, tormented criminal beating for so long in a gentle mother’s chest. Her coronary arteries — his coronary arteries — are amazingly clear.

Eva has never before been asked whether it bothers her that she’s got the heart of a murderer. She is asked now. She opens her mouth, then closes it again. She looks at Antonio, gets no help there, then back at the person who posed that impertinent question.

She is looking, perhaps, for a way to rationalize the unrationalizable.

Finally: “Okay, it could have been a car accident. Someone dying for no reason at all, something meaningless.” This is better, she said.

Yes, the man was a brute; his motives were warped and self-centered; his victim was blameless; his crime was unfathomably cruel. But, Eva says, it was not empty of meaning: “Someone loved someone so hard they couldn’t bear to live without them. Yes, it’s selfish. I don’t want anyone to love me to death. But it all comes out of a need to be wanted, to passionately connect with another person. That is not meaningless. And something good came out of that.”

Yes, Eva Baisey got a murderer’s heart. But it was also a broken heart. It fixed her, and she fixed it.

Correction: This story originally misidentified Alan Speir as the person who sewed a new heart into Dick Cheney’s chest. Speir was part of the team that performed Cheney’s surgery, but the principal surgeon — the person who sewed in the new heart — was Anthony Rongione.

Although it was not exactly an unpredictable development, the arrival of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump could change a lot of things for the Democrats hoping to face him in 2020. On the one hand, it has made it easy for impeachment fence-sitters to finally go with the flow, making impeachment itself no longer a divisive campaign issue. On the other hand, it is a massive distraction from the messages the candidates had carefully prepared before and during the early stages of the campaign, as Sean Sullivan observes:

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact …

[T]he drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”

There is one candidate, however, who may view the impeachment issue as a possible way to get her mojo back: Kamala Harris. Molly Hensley-Clancy lays out how that might work, and why it could give Harris a boost:

Iowans know what they like about Kamala Harris. They’ve seen it on TV: the sharp-tongued, compassionate, and courageous prosecutor that leaves them imagining an unflappable black woman on the debate stage next to Donald Trump …

Her presidential campaign had fallen into a dangerous pattern: after capturing the country’s attention with moments of prosecutorial brilliance, she had seen excitement about her candidacy soar, only to fall back to Earth …

In Iowa last weekend, the roots of her campaign’s see-saw were clear: It was hard for voters to see Harris the prosecutor. Harris the presidential candidate was meandering and often indirect, struggling to present a strong argument for her own campaign …

With President Donald Trump teetering on the edge of possible impeachment, though, Harris has a clear opportunity. Kamala Harris the prosecutor is already back on Americans’ television screens and could be set for a prime role in a potential Senate impeachment trial.

I’m not so sure. Like the other five senators in the presidential race, Harris has the problem of being more or less a spectator to the drama unfolding in the House, and a prisoner to Republican control of their own chamber. Yes, she is a member of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, potential venues of hearings related to the impeachment drive and the underlying issues. But she won’t have a chance to grill witnesses as she did during the Comey and Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, unless the Republican chairs of those committees (Richard Burr and Lindsey Graham, respectively) choose to give her and other Democrats that opportunity. In theory, Mitch McConnell could create some sort of special committee to handle ancillary investigations — of the sort that, during the early stages of the Watergate scandal, made the Foghorn Leghorn soundalike Sam Ervin and even the racist demagogue Herman Talmadge national icons. But why would he want to do that when the GOP’s party line is that there is absolutely nothing worth investigating in Trump’s conduct?

As for the impeachment trial (assuming there is one), the one thing we know for sure is that Mitch McConnell will make it just extensive enough to claim that Trump is exonerated at the end of its forgone conclusion in acquittal, and not a moment longer or deeper. And traditionally, senators have been quiet in anticipation of and during impeachment trials, in accord with the criminal-law analogy of them as “jurors” weighing evidence for the impeachment “indictment,” as I explained recently:

According to precedent, senators act like jurors, making no public statements on the proceeding until after their votes are cast (in the Clinton case, senators spoke before the vote in a closed-door session, with their remarks published in the Congressional Record after the vote).

Not a lot of headline-grabbing drama in that procedure.

While I am dubious of the idea that Harris will definitely have a “prime role” in an impeachment trial or related Senate proceedings, Hensley-Clancy is spot-on in observing that the Californian really needs a boost and probably a change in the topics she is addressing on the stump. Harris’s original campaign strategy, based explicitly on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, was to establish herself as a nationally credible candidate before or during the Iowa caucuses, and then win a breakthrough victory in South Carolina by taking away African-American support from Biden just as Obama did from Hillary Clinton. Indeed, she had an advantage even Obama didn’t enjoy, thanks to her home state holding its own primary just a few days after South Carolina, as I observed soon after she entered the race:

In the sports language often used (along with combat and gambling lingo) by political operatives, one of Harris’s people called this strategy: “the SEC primary meets the West Coast offense.” And it makes sense, on paper, particularly if Harris can go into South Carolina with a head of steam and win there.

In fact, after she boxed Joe Biden’s ears in the first candidate debate in June, it looked like Harris was emerging as a world-beater whose stock would rise in every state. But her subsequent downward drift in polling, which continued throughout the summer and into the fall, has led to a strategic reassessment by her campaign. Long story short, she’s been doing so poorly in South Carolina that she’s pouring most of her resources into Iowa to execute the sort of jiujitsu that salvaged John Kerry’s once-doomed candidacy in 2004 (Kerry was badly trailing Howard Dean in New Hampshire, so he went for broke in Iowa and won there in an upset that revived his standing in the Granite State and elsewhere). So far, it’s not working any wonders just yet: in Ann Selzer’s recent gold-standard Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Harris was running a poor fifth with 6 percent of the vote. Trouble is, the four candidates above her in Iowa are emphasizing the first-in-the-nation caucuses, too, and unlike, say, Elizabeth Warren, Harris is not exactly setting Iowa on fire with her many personal appearances there, as Hensley-Clancy and others have reported.

And meanwhile, the news from later states on the calendar keeps getting worse for Harris. A new CNN poll of South Carolina has her tied with Tom Steyer for fifth place at a mere 3 percent — a point behind Pete Buttigieg, for whom the Palmetto State is hardly a major target. And the latest poll from California, conducted by the Berkeley IGS for the L.A. Times, has the state’s favorite daughter running fourth in single digits, 21 points behind front-running Warren.

Sure, this could all change again: The combative and compelling Kamala Harris of that first debate could return in subsequent debates, and perhaps she can find a way via impeachment to play the prosecutor again (though that role has its own perils, as Tulsi Gabbard showed in eviscerating Harris’s record as California attorney general in the July debate). What she most needs is a collapse of support for Joe Biden, who stands directly in the way of Harris’s efforts to attract African-American votes and to serve as a fallback candidate for voters worried about Warren and Sanders’s vulnerabilities as symbols of the Democratic Party’s leftward drift. But in any event, Harris will soon run out of time. At this point in 2008, Obama was doing a lot better in Iowa, South Carolina, and nationally. There’s only so long that she can remain a candidate of great, if unrealized, potential."

Ben: Today, Senator Kamala Harris wrote a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey requesting that he ban President Trump from the platform, citing his efforts to “target, harass, and attempt to out the whistle-blower” who has lodged a complaint against him, and his suggestion that his removal from the presidency will lead to a civil war, among other things. Regardless of the political wisdom of this idea — Harris is struggling mightily in the polls and this seems like a bid for some attention — does it make any sense to you?

Max: I mean, sure, it makes sense. She’s right; he’s pretty obviously in violation of Twitter policy and has been for years.

Ben: Yeah, this is a frequent complaint lodged by a lot of people. But is it actually a good idea?

Max: Ha. For whom?

Ben: Society?

Brian: My attitude about Trump’s use of Twitter mirrors a lot of how I think about stuff like deepfakes: Whether it’s effective is based on whether it’s amplified by other important people/outlets. So would people stop repeating the president’s wild rants if he had to do it on, I dunno, Facebook? Probably not.

Ben: I think there’s a difference here: He’s the president, so anything he says is newsworthy, unfortunately — unlike a deepfake, which could just go unremarked upon.

Brian: Right. I guess that’s my point. Shutting down the account wouldn’t dull any tensions. Would I love to see it happen? Sure. But I can’t imagine it would have a calming effect.

Max: Yeah, I think I agree with Feldman to the extent that “banning Trump from Twitter” seems like a poor stand-in for some more consequential response. I don’t really think Trump derives as much power from Twitter as I think the call to ban him supposes.

I think society might be marginally better off if he were banned, but, as Feldman is saying, Twitter is just one component of a media ecosystem that has been pretty effectively and thoroughly bent around Trump.

Brian: I think there is a slight belief that if we knock out Trump’s Twitter account, he’ll be crippled somehow. It’s a very naïve, “out of sight out of mind” mentality. He’ll just call into Fox & Friends or call a friendly reporter on background. He’s got plenty of allies willing to amplify his message if he can’t do it himself. Again, I’d love to see tech companies that claim to care about toxicity and stuff put their money where their mouth is, but in the case of the president, it feels pretty pointless.

Ben: Okay, so narrowing the scope of the argument a bit: If it won’t make a difference in terms of what the president puts out, does Twitter not have a responsibility to enforce its rules? I think many would cheer banning Trump, not because it will actually turn down the volume of his awfulness but because it would send a message that his conduct is not fit for a prominent communications platform.

Max: I think Twitter has a responsibility to enforce its rules, yeah. But Twitter also has the ability to change it rules in whatever ways it sees fit. The “rules” thing is what Kendra Albert calls a “legal talisman” — we like to talk about the “rules” of platforms as though they take the same shape as laws in the context of a government or a state.

It’s not like Twitter is great at cleanup now. It doesn’t really feel hypocritical that the prez remains when, like, heinous accounts remain all over. He’s not an outlier is all I mean, maybe in stature but not behavior.

Ben: Yes, they’re famously bad at this.

Breaking news: Elizabeth Warren was asked about this very question just now, per this tweet:

REPORTER: “Should Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?”

ELIZABETH WARREN: [laughs] “No.”

Max: I think Warren has the right idea. It’s hard for me to gin up much anger at Twitter over this specific thing. “Twitter inconsistently applies its own company policy” seems relatively minor in the scheme of problems in how “the media” — as a kind of overall ecosystem — deals with Trump. And I think trying to isolate Twitter, its relationship to Trump’s personal account, and its deployment of its policies … I don’t know, it seems kind of narrow-minded at best. Sorry, I know “eh, shrug” is not the kind of invigorating intellectual debate we might want, but I think it’s the one we deserve.

Brian: Once Congress makes it so that Twitter poll results are legally binding contracts, then it’s time to worry.

Ben: Presumably you don’t think there’s a chance Twitter would ever follow through on this? What if he specifically directed people to go after, say, Adam Schiff? This hardly seems out of the realm of possibility.

Brian: They’re both public figures — they live for drama. Remember when that support guy deactivated the account for like 11 minutes? That was so funny. So I guess now I support it because it’d be a good troll.

Max: I guess the problem I have with that hypothetical is, like (I’m thinking out loud here, don’t hold me to this), do we really think Schiff would suddenly be in more danger than normal if Trump tweeted, I don’t know, “Get Adam Schiff”?

Ben: Yeah, I do.

Max: Maybe I am underrating the power of DJT or the power of Twitter, or maybe I’m just a callous old troll. But my general feeling about the threat that Trump poses is that it’s generalized and diffuse and occurs along a bunch of different vectors.

And that the kind of hypothetical, like, “Well, what if he incited violence in a tweet?” question sort of misses the forest for the trees. I’m just interrogating my own instinctive response.

Ben: I see your point — it’s just that the violation in this case would be SO blatant I think Twitter might have to do something. It’s kind of like impeachment: There was enough there before this Ukraine thing, but this was just so comically corrupt that inaction was not an option.

Max: Yeah, impeachment a good comparison, Ben. I guess where the analogy continues for me is in the way that, by rights, he should have been banned years ago! So it’s hard to take any sort of “judicial process” around it seriously.

Ben: So let’s just not try.

Max: Haha. Well, okay, if we’re talking about impeachment and Twitter, maybe I’d say: To me, there aren’t several specific crimes here that mean he should or should not be impeached or banned. There’s one big overall problem, which is that he’s manifestly corrupt and unfit for office. Actually, I take it back. Maybe this doesn’t get us anywhere. Sorry, it’s turning out I have less of an opinion about this than I actually even thought. I guess I do sort of think he should be banned, but I truly can’t bring myself to care enough to make a strong case for it!

Ben: This is the kind of strong conviction people look for when they turn to Intelligencer.

Max: I think more than anything it just speaks to how badly Harris must be doing that she’s picking this up as her issue.

Ben: Yes.

Brian: In the face of a zillion important anti-Trump causes, his use of Twitter does not rank highly even for me, an idiot who has to think about Twitter too much."

In Washington this week, U.S. and Chinese negotiators are scheduled to resume stalled trade talks as each economy shows significant signs of strain. Whether the mounting casualties will hasten a deal is unclear, but for millions of workers, the damage is already done.

AD

The plight of Northwest Hardwoods reflects the economic toll of more than a year of open confrontation. For months, Trump has crowed about the damage his tariffs were inflicting on the slowing Chinese economy even as the United States powered into the 11th year of a record-setting expansion.

“China is getting killed,” Trump told reporters Friday. “The tariffs are killing China.”

Fresh data last week, however, showed that American factories are operating at their lowest rate in 10 years, matching Chinese plants, which posted their own worst-in-a-decade results in July.

AD

While the president’s rhetoric remains cheery — he said last week “we have the hottest economy in the world” — the reality of the manufacturing recession and anemic growth he will probably carry into the 2020 campaign shows the trade war has pinched business on both sides of the Pacific. That shifting economic landscape is making a settlement more urgent, according to groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

AD

“We’ve reached the point where both countries are in the same boat,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “In the absence of the trade war, both the U.S. and China would be doing quite well. There would be no slowdown.”

As the trade war began last year, the United States was enjoying the economic amphetamine of the 2017 tax cut, which helped offset any drag caused by higher import penalties. China, meanwhile, was trying to wean itself from an unhealthy dependence upon debt to power its growth. The chilling effect of U.S. tariffs only compounded Beijing’s challenge.

AD

More than a year later, the United States boasts the lowest unemployment rate since 1969 and rising wages. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York puts the chance of a recession in the next 12 months at a little more than 1-in-3.

AD

Yet the tax-cut buzz has worn off. Business spending on warehouses, factories and machines — which the president promised would soar if taxes were reduced — declined in the second quarter, its worst performance since late 2015. Weakness appears to be spreading from manufacturing into the larger services sector.

China continues to struggle with its debt-reduction efforts but has dulled the trade war pain by loosening borrowing limits for local governments and pressing bankers to lend more freely.

AD

“It’s an exaggeration to say they’re in terrible shape,” said David Dollar of the Brookings Institution, who was a Treasury Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing from 2009 to 2013.

After growing at an annual rate of 3.1 percent earlier this year, the U.S. economy is now advancing at about 1.5 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase. Harris, from Bank of America, projected that the U.S. economy will only grow at about a 1 percent rate over the next six months, a painfully slow clip. China’s economy is also expected to weaken in the next six months, he said, as its official growth rate heads to 5.7 percent next year, the first reading below 6 percent since 1990.

AD

Trump claims that the trade war has cost China 3 million factory jobs, an estimate that economist Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calls “delusional.”

AD

Chinese manufacturing employment began falling several years ago, as workers grew more productive and the fast-growing services industry demanded more labor. The shrinkage in total factory employment has actually slowed since the trade war started, according to Lardy.

Robert E. Lighthizer, the president’s chief trade negotiator, has acknowledged that confronting China over its trade practices is causing economic pain. But he told Congress earlier this year that short-term suffering will ultimately prove worthwhile because it will prevent China from cheating and stealing its way into global technological dominance.

AD

Lighthizer has led negotiations with the Chinese for more than a year, aiming to secure a comprehensive deal that would shrink the chronic imbalance between the amount of goods the U.S. imports and exports with China. The administration also wants China to abandon core elements of its state-directed economic model.

AD

The next 10 weeks offer many moments when the trade war’s flames could intensify or be extinguished. On Oct. 15, a few days after the next round of talks ends, the United States is scheduled to raise its 25 percent tariff on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30 percent.

U.S. companies pay almost all of those costs, which they often pass along to consumers.

If negotiators make headway in the coming days, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet to broker a deal in mid-November at an Asia-Pacific leaders summit in Santiago, Chile. Trump has frequently delayed tariff increases in hopes of persuading the Chinese to cut a deal.

AD

Just days later, on Nov. 18, the temporary license that allows Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, to buy critical U.S. components expires. If Trump opts not to grant an extension, Sino-U.S. relations could go into a deeper freeze.

AD

On Dec. 15, the United States is scheduled to impose a final batch of tariffs, effectively taxing every Chinese product that enters the country.

All this uncertainty is complicating the Federal Reserve’s management of the economy, according to Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell. Last month, Powell told reporters that businesses are complaining that confusion over when and how the trade war will end is paralyzing their investment plans.

At Biotricity of Redwood City, Calif., a maker of remote monitoring devices for chronic illnesses, chief executive Waqaas Al-Siddiq is frustrated by the amount of time and money he’s devoting to his supply chain rather than product development.

AD

AD

After the United States in September imposed tariffs on components he imported from China, Al-Siddiq searched for a made-in-America alternative. He eventually thought he had found a domestic solution, only to discover at the last minute that it also relied upon a Chinese factory for parts.

As his tariff bills mounted, he cut back on capital spending and research and development, he said.

“One hundred thousand dollars we’ve spent on tariffs and that continues to increase,” Al-Siddiq said. “These dollars would be better invested creating American jobs.”

The president’s trade offensives against China and the European Union are not the only restraints on the U.S. economy. American businesses also are feeling the effects of sluggish growth in Europe and the Fed’s eight interest rate increases over the two years that ended in December. The Fed has cut rates twice since the end of July, but Trump complains that it should be moving faster.

AD

The economic sectors that are hurting are those most exposed to the trade winds. That’s largely because China crafted its retaliation for Trump’s tariffs to hurt his political supporters in the industrial Midwest and the farm belt.

Over the past year, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota and New Hampshire each have shed thousands of factory jobs. The president won the first three states in 2016 and hopes to capture the last two in next year’s election, the type of domestic politics that Chinese leaders don’t face.

“Politically, there’s no cost to China from this. But there could be a great cost to President Trump if the economy underperforms and it costs him the election,” said David Page, senior economist for Axa Investment Managers in London.

Likewise, export-dependent farmers who backed Trump heavily are struggling. Purdue University’s Ag Economy Barometer released last week found “a relatively large sentiment shift among ag producers as they were noticeably more pessimistic about current conditions on their farms and in the U.S. ag economy.”

“Farmers have been very patient,” said Larry Buss, a farmer in Harrison County, Iowa, who supports Trump. “We don’t like the trade war with China. We worked very hard to build our markets. To see those markets totally go away in a year’s time has been pretty frustrating.”

Though the economy continues growing, there are hints of broader erosion. First-time claims for unemployment benefits have increased for three consecutive weeks, though they remain near half-century lows. Companies announcing layoffs in recent weeks include Hewlett-Packard, Citigroup, Nestle, Bayer and Navistar.

FedEx, a bellwether of the global economy, last month reported that profits fell 11 percent in its most recent quarter. In response, the package delivery company is retiring aircraft, deferring hiring and slashing spending on new equipment — decisions that spread weakness through the rest of the economy.

“I think there is a lot of whistling past the graveyard about the U.S. consumer and the United States economy,” Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, told investors on a recent earnings call.

Back in Tacoma, Jeppson wonders whether he will ever regain his Chinese customers, who have started buying hardwoods from Russia, Indonesia and Gabon. For now, he’s keeping a close eye on expenses, hoping to hold things together until Washington and Beijing settle their differences or at least agree to a cease-fire."

In one respect, it was a nothingburger of a story: California’s senior senator Dianne Feinstein formally endorsed the presidential candidate she has been informally backing all along, Joe Biden. Indeed, as the San Francisco Chronicle noted in first reporting the development, Feinstein hosted a fundraiser for Uncle Joe in her home just last week.

But the lack of any particular reason to draw attention to the Californian’s support for her old friend has to make you wonder why it was necessary to produce one. Having stepped right up to the fail-safe line and signaled her ultimate intentions, Feinstein would normally have refrained from a formal endorsement that severely disrespected her junior Golden State colleague, Kamala Harris, not to mention the other four U.S. senators currently in the race, as the Los Angeles Times observed:

Feinstein’s endorsement stands out not just for the home-state slight, but that she has picked sides at all. With five current senators still in the race, many of their colleagues have declined to endorse at all, citing wariness of choosing favorites among their political friends.

Indeed, of the Democratic senators endorsing a candidate so far, the only ones who are not from that candidate’s home state are Bob Casey, from Biden’s native state of Pennsylvania; Doug Jones of Alabama, who desperately needs to identify himself with the moderate wing of his party; and now Feinstein. Maybe it was just a coincidence that Feinstein made her move soon after Warren moved ahead of Biden in two highly influential California primary polls (from PPIC and LAT/Berkeley), even as she also pulled ahead of the former veep in RealClearPolitics’ national polling averages. But probably not. We may see more big Biden endorsements, if my hunch is right and Biden is calling in all his chits to maintain his position as at least a co-front-runner in the 2020 race. Too bad for him that the endorsement that could do him the most good, from Barack Obama, will probably never come, unless and until Biden wins the nomination on his own."

A new USA Today/Suffolk survey of Iowa is raising eyebrows today because it seems to confirm that Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge of support following his notable showing in last week’s candidate debate in Ohio:

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice-president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds.

Biden, long viewed as the Democratic front-runner, is faltering in the wake of a debate performance last week that those surveyed saw as disappointing.

The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18 percent, Warren at 17 percent and Buttigieg at 13 percent among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers.

The characterization of Biden as “faltering” after the last debate is a bit questionable, since his showing in the USAT/Suffolk survey is pretty much in line with most recent Iowa polling showing him more or less even with Warren in the state with other candidates trading positions in a tier just below them. For that matter, all four polls of Iowa taken in October (from USAT/Suffolk, Emerson, YouGov, and Firehouse Strategies/Optimus) before and after the Ohio debate have shown Mayor Pete in double digits. But this latest headline certainly reinforces the narrative Buttigieg wanted after changing his persona from the irenic, erudite peacemaker of the early going to the fighting moderate displayed in Westerville, as my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti explained after the debate:

This candidate, eager to look like a truth-teller and get in the mix as the bigger-name contenders wage ideological war, has sharper elbows than the version who has quietly been building up his Iowa operation in recent months. It’s all part of a bet he’s making that drawing these kinds of stark contrasts now — just as more voters tune in to the race and just as Warren surges — can position him to be an alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters or at least vault him from the floor of the race’s top tier, alongside Kamala Harris, to somewhere in the vicinity of Bernie Sanders’s third-place status.

Iowa, of course (and New Hampshire, where Buttigieg is also doing pretty well in polls), is a state whose demographics do not penalize Mayor Pete for his poor standing with minority voters, especially the African-Americans who will dominate southern primaries beginning with South Carolina. This is a significant element of Biden’s base, and it’s unclear whether Buttigieg’s weakness there is attributable to his wine-track stylings, his not so great reputation among South Bend’s black activists, his openly gay sexual orientation, or a combination of factors. But if Mayor Pete is struggling a bit to break out of his demographic limitations, two of his competitors are in greater peril as Iowa polling shows. Both Harris (“I’m moving to f***ing Iowa”) and Cory Booker have heavily invested in Iowa, hoping to replicate Barack Obama’s 2008 strategy of impressing South Carolina’s majority-black primary electorate by proving viability among white voters in the early going. They’re both currently polling in the low single digits in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. The USAT/Suffolk survey was a particularly depressing bit of news for this pair of candidates: Harris, who was running a strong second to Biden in the previous USAT/Suffolk poll at the end of June, is now trailing Tom Steyer and is tied with Tulsi Gabbard, while Booker is in tenth place, behind Andrew Yang.

It’s tempting to say Harris and Booker badly need a breakthrough performance in the November debate in Atlanta, though with Booker, who has been relatively impressive in every debate, you have to wonder if even that would be enough to lift him into serious contention. And while endorsements usually don’t matter all that much in presidential contests, Buttigieg would likely benefit from the support of a high-profile African-American opinion leader. Maybe he can talk Oprah Winfrey out of her current preoccupation with convincing Disney exec Bob Iger to run."

Kamala D. Harris of California, a Democratic presidential contender, asked the company to suspend Trump’s account, claiming his online communications “put people at risk and our democracy in danger.”

AD

Appearing at the fourth Democratic presidential debate, Harris on Tuesday again assailed Twitter, charging the president had weaponized the platform “to openly intimidate witnesses” in the ongoing impeachment investigation. She said his account should be removed as a “matter of safety and corporate accountability.”

AD

The dispute stems from Twitter’s announcement this summer that it would label tweets from world leaders whose comments violate site policies, including those designed to prevent harm and abuse. The rules were designed to strike a balance between the public’s right to know and Twitter’s efforts to ensure hate speech, misinformation and other troubling content do not go viral.

But Twitter’s application of the policy ultimately invited widespread criticism, after the company opted not to label a number of Trump’s tweets Democrats and digital watchdogs saw as improper. In July, for instance, the president told four congresswomen of color to “go back” to their countries, a tweet widely criticized as a racist attack in violation of Twitter’s rules against hate speech.

AD

In an attempt to clarify its rules, Twitter said Tuesday it would take enforcement actions against “any account” in certain, dire circumstances, including instances when a world leader threatens a user with direct violence or publishes private information, such as a home address.

AD

But Twitter also noted there were cases when the company may not act, such as when heads of state have “direct interactions” with their peers or engage in “foreign policy saber rattling on economic and military issues,” which it said are not violations of rules. Nor would the company seek to “determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,” it said.

For those tweets that are labeled as violations, Twitter said it would also take steps to limit their spread on the site: Users would not be able to retweet or like that content, for example. The company said it has not yet applied this label.

AD

“With critical elections and shifting political dynamics around the world, we recognize that we’re operating in an increasingly complex and polarized political culture,” Twitter said. “These are constantly evolving challenges and we’ll keep our policies and approach under advisement, particularly as we learn more about the relationship between tweets from world leaders and the potential for offline harm.

AD

The clarification did not immediately satisfy the company’s critics. In response to Twitter’s updated policies, Ian Sams, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said, “When Trump is using his tweets to make threats, incite violence and intimidate witnesses, this is insufficient.”

The request for stricter enforcement of company guidelines — and the update from Twitter — have come amid rising Democratic anger with the laissez-faire attitude adopted by technology giants toward politicians. Trump has made prolific use of the platforms, bypassing mainstream gatekeepers to speak directly to his supporters.

AD

In an Oct. 1 letter to Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, Harris, a former attorney general of California, cited examples of Trump’s tweets that disparaged the whistleblower who brought forth concerns about the president’s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart.

AD

Trump described the individual, who is a member of the intelligence community, as a “so-called ‘Whistleblower,’” and said, “I deserve to meet my accuser.” He also leveled a baseless accusation of treason, which can carry the death penalty, against Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who is leading the impeachment inquiry that could threaten his presidency.

Harris said the messages amounted to an attempt “to target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower.""

AD

“Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior,” she wrote. “And when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

Earlier this month, Facebook declined a request from former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign to take down a Trump ad that included a debunked claim about his family’s involvement with a Ukrainian gas company. The company cited its policy of exempting political speech from its fact-checking program.

AD

That drew a rebuke from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has proposed breaking up Silicon Valley giants in her bid for the Democratic nomination. She called Facebook a “disinformation-for-profit machine.”

The update from Twitter on Tuesday shows, however, that the conundrum facing social media companies extends far beyond paid advertising. The megaphone they offer politicians — including those with a penchant for mistruths — can be just as valuable and just as fraught.

Fundraising numbers for the third quarter, which ended on September 30, won’t be reported by the Federal Election Commission until after the October 15 reporting deadline. So we’re learning about money hauls from the campaigns themselves, and it’s something of a chess match as to who announces what and when.

Clearly Bernie Sanders’s campaign was excited to announce his boffo $25.3 million quarter, whether or not it had any inkling that the candidate was about to be hospitalized. Pete Buttigieg too had to be pleased with his $19.1 million raised. Even though it fell short of the $24.9 million he brought in during the second quarter, it was still very good for a candidate who’s not in the top three in national and early-state polls. Andrew Yang should be proud of the $10 million he raised; he’s definitely outperforming expectations and the polls once again. Cory Booker professed to be happy with his $6 million-and-change totals, after he told supporters he might have to fold his tent if they didn’t cough up some more dough. And given her campaign’s recent struggles, Kamala Harris could express quiet satisfaction with raising $11.6 million, just short of her second-quarter contributions.

Another number dropped today, for the candidate perceived to have been the front-runner for most of the cycle, Joe Biden, and it’s not going to blow anyone’s socks off: He raised $15 million, or so he said at a fundraising event (his campaign may have been surprised he had said that and initially declined to comment before confirming the number as $15.2 million). That’s not quite like the $22 million he reported in the previous quarter, except for the fact that he again trailed Mayor Pete. Looking at it from another angle, Biden still did 50 percent better than Yang, but I’m guessing the leader of the Gang has a much slimmer payroll to meet.

Biden’s fundraising totals will fully be placed in perspective only when Elizabeth Warren, for whom nearly everything has been coming up roses, reports her third-quarter numbers. Her heavy-on-field-staff campaign has been fueled by the $10 million she was able to transfer from her Senate campaign account and then a solid $19.2 million second quarter. If she moves ahead of Biden in fundraising now, much as she has been moving ahead of, or at least toward him, in polls, it could be significant, particularly since she has been much choosier in how and from whom she raises money. (We’ll probably have to await the FEC reports to find out details like each campaign’s cash on hand, too.)

Biden’s clearly not going to have to tell his staff to work without pay anytime soon, but, as in many other respects, he’s a presidential candidate flying around without much of a net."

With all the buzz this week over polling on impeachment, you may have missed some trends in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. For the first time, it may be appropriate to refer to Joe Biden as the “former front-runner” or at least as “the co-front-runner.” The most-quoted source of polling averages, RealClearPolitics, has had Biden at the top of its Democratic presidential list since it began compiling such averages in December 2018 (five months before he formally entered the race). Today its two-week averages show Elizabeth Warren overtaking the former veep in national surveys with 26.6 percent to his 26.4 percent. Bernie Sanders is a distant third at 14.6 percent, and, of the other candidates, only Pete Buttigieg (5.6 percent) and Kamala Harris (4.4. percent) are above three percent. Only Biden’s 12-point lead in the increasingly outlier-like Politico/Morning Consult tracking poll is keeping him more or less in sync with Warren.

Warren is also leading Biden in the RCP polling averages for Iowa, though Biden remains slightly ahead of the field in New Hampshire and Nevada (where Sanders is second) and more impressive in South Carolina. Biden retains his lead in head-to-head general-election trial heats against Trump in the RCP averages with a 7.4 percent lead compared to 5.2 percent for Sanders, 4.5 percent for Warren, two percent for Buttigieg and one percent for Harris. In the very latest trial heat from Quinnipiac, Warren has moved into second place, leading Trump by 8 percent, with Biden still ahead of her at 11 percent and Sanders just behind her at 7 percent."

Ben: Who do you think had a really good night tonight?

Sarah: Bernie. Warren, too. But Bernie was really impressive tonight. Sharp, clear, consistent.

Zak: Agreed. And not long after a heart attack, too. You’d have trouble getting me out of bed, let alone subject myself to this.

Ben: As others have pointed out, he was slightly toned down — which made him seem more effective.

Zak: I was never that put off by his ranting-granddad vibe, but it’s true that toning things down made his arguments seem less like insistent diatribes and more like reasonable presentations of commonsense ideas, at least superficially.

Sarah: Bernie’s tone never bothered me, to be honest. I never found him to be particularly shouty, and in any case, his unvarnished affect seems to be part of his appeal. So my takeaway isn’t really that Bernie succeeded because he toned it down. His answers were tight, his comments were critical when they needed to be, and he ably defended his policies from attack.

Zak: And I’ll echo Sarah on Warren’s good night. She weathered the attention that comes with being the front-runner way more smoothly and graciously than Biden. Less rattled, better able to lucidly stay on message, and never seemed to take anything personally.

Ben: Unlike in some past debates, the central target of the also-rans wasn’t Joe Biden, but the newly appointed front-runner, Warren. In an early exchange, she once again did not say whether she would raise taxes to fund Medicare for All, earning some criticism from Pete Buttigieg and others. Did this, or any of the other attacks against her, draw any blood?

Zak: I think her refusal to answer that question on those particular terms is a reasonable gamble. It risks her coming off as evasive, but I think pushing people to think more about overall costs versus just taxes is a net positive and has the potential to shift the terms of the discussion in a way that helps her cause. Plus the accusation themselves just aren’t that meaty. We know what her answer is going to be, and at a certain point it starts feeling like the people to whom it’s most scandalous are the reporters who insist on asking it knowing what the answer will be.

Sarah: I’d like for her to develop a more detailed answer on Medicare for All but overall I think she handled herself well. She’s made her wealth tax such a centerpiece of her campaign that the typical “but how will you pay for it” line that always gets lobbed at left-wing candidates falls a little flat. One other thing I appreciate about Warren (and Sanders, for that matter) is that she has little patience for gotcha questions, and I think that trait’s been useful to her in the debates.

Ben: Pete Buttigieg was considerably more combative in this debate than in previous affairs. He challenged Elizabeth Warren directly on her refusal to say she’d raise taxes with her health-care plan. He told Beto O’Rourke that “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” during an exchange on gun laws. In an effort to break into the top tier, he’s positioning himself as a moderate who will not hesitate to criticize those to his left. Is this working for him or coming off as arrogant? Or something in between?

Zak: There’s always something so incongruous to me about being extremely combative in defense of moderation. It’s especially off-brand for Buttigieg because we’ve come to expect this pragmatic levelheadedness and desire to stay above the fray and discourage in-fighting and all of a sudden he’s scolding everybody.

Sarah: It didn’t work for him. Look, Sanders and Warren have a clear message. Everyone knows who they are and what they represent. It’s difficult to say the same of Buttigieg. His alternative to Medicare for All sounds like a joke people would make on Twitter, and the “I’m just a sensible man from the heartland” routine is a bit rich coming from a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar whose father was a Marxist professor at the University of Notre Dame. When Buttigieg speaks, I don’t hear anything that resembles the concerns of actual voters; I hear a wonk. And while that’s partly because I’m a socialist and have different politics, I don’t think Buttigieg’s smarm is entirely a figment of my imagination.

And I agree with Zak. I think the notion of a pugnacious moderate is a bit of contradiction in terms.

Ben: Why didn’t anyone (or almost anyone) attack Joe Biden? It seems that people have crowned Warren as the obvious front-runner — but he’s still doing very well in national polls and many state polls, too.

Zak: Probably reserved about the broader implications of fueling Trump’s attacks. There seems to be a tacit agreement among Democrats not to admit openly that the Hunter business is shady, paired with a willingness to take a “wait and see” approach to how it affects Biden’s campaign moving forward.

Sarah: Trump’s complicated that a bit by going after Hunter. I actually think there’s plenty to criticize about Hunter’s business dealings, and would’ve liked to see someone press Biden on the cronyism, but nobody wants to look as if they’re aligned with Trump. I think, too, that candidates do recognize that Biden has a healthy base of support, and they’re wary of alienating those voters. Perhaps they think that Biden will self-immolate, given enough time.

Ben: That has been the conventional wisdom with him for a while and it keeps not happening — though he has faded a bit in recent weeks.

Sarah: Yes, and I think that’s due partly to his performance in the debates. He’s incoherent much of the time.

Ben: What’s up with Kamala Harris? She went from dominating the first debate to having an extended exchange where she tried to “gotcha” Elizabeth Warren by accusing her of not being onboard with banning President Trump from Twitter. That was weird.

Zak: I think she isn’t sure what she stands for and is throwing a lot of different things at the wall to see what sticks.

Sarah: I don’t think she really knows why she’s running for president?

Ben: We’ve all been there.

Sarah: Haha.

Ben: Any other candidates you thought shone or did the opposite of that?

Sarah: Why was Tom Steyer onstage? I mean, I know why, but he has no business being there.

Ben: He did not talk much.

Sarah: Right, and when he did talk, he did not do himself any favors.

Zak: Tom Steyer was like the amalgamation of every white man who’s dropped out so far. Plus Howard Schultz. I like to think they all just jumped into the same body and put it on a plane to Ohio.

Sarah: This is a terrible Transformers movie.

Zak: I was gonna say I pitched this as a Being John Malkovich sequel. No takers so far, but I’m shopping it.

Ben: Haha.

What was the most glaring absence in terms of topics? Gotta be climate, right?

﻿Zak: I think so, especially in the wake of the strikes and U.N. testimonies.

﻿Sarah: Climate, yes. But housing, too. Kind of shocking that we’ve yet to get a single question about the housing crisis.

Ben: Lastly, we’ve all noticed that the debates don’t tend to change the underlying dynamics or numbers of the race all that much. Is there anything about this one that people will remember and that will really make an impression?

Sarah: No.

Zak: Nope.

Tuesday, October 15, marked the deadline for presidential candidates to submit third-quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission. Some got out ahead of the deadline by releasing their fundraising hauls early. Others, such as Wayne Messam, the little-known Democratic mayor of Miramar, Florida, and for some reason also a presidential candidate, did not.

But with the deadline comes full reports from all of the candidates and a clearer picture of where they stand, money-wise, 110 days before the Iowa caucuses. The top-line figure is total money raised and Bernie Sanders led in the third quarter by bringing in $25.2 million. His Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren, was not far behind with $24.6 million. Pete Buttigieg surprised with $19.1 million, Joe Biden disappointed with $15.7 million, and Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with $11.7 million.

There are some other noteworthy nuggets buried in these reports, including:

Wayne Messam raised just $5.

You could have watched every minute of every presidential debate so far and never known that Messam is running for president. But he is. The mayor of Miramar, which is bigger than South Bend, reported raising just $5 in the third quarter. On the plus side, that’s five more dollars than he spent.

Joe Biden’s bank account is dwindling.

The former vice-president doesn’t just trail Senators Sanders and Warren in fundraising, he trails them in amount of money on hand. With $8.98 million in his bank account, Biden is also lagging behind Buttigieg and Harris.

Politico explains that the problem is tied to Biden’s reliance on big-money donors:

As Biden’s campaign spending picked up over the summer, his reliance on maximum donors — who can give only once and are not a renewable campaign resource — meant that his fundraising could not keep pace. More than one-third of Biden’s contributions came from maximum donors in the second quarter, and max-out donors composed a similar portion of a smaller pie for Biden this quarter.

That could also explain why Biden was underwater in the third quarter, spending nearly $2 million more than he brought in.

Ten candidates spent more than they brought in.

It’s never good when you spend more money than you make, and that’s what ten candidates did last quarter. But the candidate whose numbers were the most mismatched is Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota senator spent $7.8 million and brought in $4.8 million. That’s good for a 162 percent burn rate.

Tom Steyer is his own biggest fan.

The California billionaire spent big in the third quarter after getting into the race in early July, dropping a staggering $47 million, a sum that the L.A. Times says “places him on track to join the biggest self-funding political candidates in American history.” The $47 million is nearly all of the $49.6 million that Steyer brought in during the third quarter. Who did the money come from? Nearly $1.5 million from small donors, a half million from large donors, and $47.6 million from Steyer himself."

Georgia Tech (2-5, 1-3 ACC) also scored on a fumble recovery after a sack in the end zone by Ja’Quon Griffin in the first quarter, on a 41-yard pass by punter Pressley Harvin III on a fake in the second quarter and later a 35-yard strike from James Graham to Ahmearan Brown. The Yellow Jackets finished off the win by getting a fourth-down stop inside their 5, by maybe a couple of inches, to end Miami’s lone overtime possession.

“By far the best play I’ve ever had in my life,” Harvin said of his pinpoint pass to Nathan Cottrell for the fake-punt score.

Miami (3-4, 1-3) matched its worst seven-game start in 22 years. The Hurricanes missed three more field goals, all from relatively close range.

All four of Miami’s losses have been by seven points or fewer, and missed kicks have been a factor in all of them. Baxa had short misses in Miami’s losses to Florida and North Carolina, and a missed PAT late against Virginia Tech kept Miami from taking a 36-35 lead late in what became a 42-35 loss.

Georgia Tech nearly took the lead with 10 minutes left, when Jamious Griffin busted through multiple tackles and got to the end zone. But replay show the edge of his right foot — barely — touched the sideline during the run, and the Yellow Jackets fumbled the ball away three plays later.

But Miami couldn’t take advantage, and the Yellow Jackets got the block at the end of regulation, then needed only three Mason carries — 2 yards, 22 yards and then the 1-yarder — to take the lead in OT. Perry’s fourth-down pass to Brevin Jordan was inches shy of a first down on the game’s final play, and Georgia Tech sprinted onto the field in celebration.

“We stepped up big today,” Owens said.

THE TAKEAWAY

Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets hadn’t scored more than 24 points in a game this season, and entered the game as one of four of the 130 FBS teams not to cross that threshold. They’ve now beaten Miami in back-to-back seasons.

Miami: WR Jeff Thomas was suspended for the game for violating team rules, the latest downturn in his Miami career. Thomas was dismissed from the team last season, announced he was transferring to Illinois and then returned to the Hurricanes. Thomas has 24 catches for 270 yards and two touchdowns this season, plus another 192 yards on 11 kick and punt returns.

BAD ODDS

Miami was a 31-point favorite against Central Michigan and won by five, a 14-point favorite against Virginia Tech and lost by a touchdown — and was an 18-point favorite Saturday, losing again. This was the first time since 1974 that Miami lost to a team that entered with a 1-5 record or worse this deep into a season; that year, the Hurricanes lost to then 0-8 Florida State.

FiveThirtyEight’s Perry Bacon Jr. posed a question this week that might have chilled the bones of progressives while thrilling centrists. It’s one that is asked of presidential candidates from both parties if an approaching general election is perceived as highly competitive, as 2020’s is expected to be:

Several of Joe Biden’s top rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary are presenting themselves as more liberal on policy issues than the former vice-president. But if Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris were to win the nomination, would they reposition themselves to appeal to more centrist voters in a general election?

It’s a question that in the not-too-distant past would have been answered affirmatively by most Democrats and some Republicans (the latter being more circumspect about arousing the suspicions of conservative ideologues forever trying to identify and purge RINOs, or Republicans In Name Only). No one would be as blatant as 2012 Mitt Romney communications director Eric Fehrnstrom:

[W]hen Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was “Etch A Sketch,” the children’s drawing toy in which nothing is ever permanent.

“Everything changes,” Mr. Fehrnstrom, 50, said on CNN, with a slight smirk that suggested he believed he was about to use a clever line. “It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.”

Conservatives who thought most of their policy positions came down from the Founders, if not from God Almighty, were not amused, and it exacerbated Romney’s reputation for being an unprincipled opportunist. And it’s the sort of thing Democratic progressives might fear in an ideologically anodyne candidate like Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg. In their struggle to challenge Elizabeth Warren’s progressive credentials, you can imagine Bernie Sanders supporters fanning fears that the Massachusetts senator might “move to the center” if nominated. She is, after all, a Democrat, not a Democratic Socialist, the self-identification that pretty much precludes any “move to the center” by Bernie if it involves changing policy positions (many of which he’s had for decades).

But as Bacon observes, a nomination winner’s efforts to expand her base of support heading into a general election can be accomplished in ways other than changing policy positions or adopting new ones designed to appeal to “centrists” or “swing voters.”

[L]ike with past nominees, it will be easier for these candidates to present themselves as more moderate in a general election through shifts in tone and their vice-presidential picks rather than moving right on policy.

They can also, I would add, emphasize a different mix of the positions, or biographical features, that they already possess to appeal to voters who aren’t in the party’s “base.” And that sometimes means forgetting about the increasingly dubious idea that swing voters are “centrist.” If you think about it for a minute, a party nominee might best emphasize his most popular policy ideas, which may be “centrist” but could just as easily be “progressive” by conventional terms; examples of the latter include free college, expanded Social Security benefits, wealth taxes, and nationalist trade policies. Indeed, a smart general-election strategy for a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren might be to choose policies and messages that rev up progressives but at the same time appeal to swing voters. Those do exist.

The base-energizing factor speaks to another issue of general-election strategy: Campaigns must calculate to what extent their winning strategy depends on mobilization as opposed to persuasion. A lot of progressives believe non-voters skew heavily in their direction, on the theory that under-voting demographic groups like millennials are disproportionately progressive, and/or haven’t viewed the two-party choice as sufficiently clear. So creating an ideologically polarized general-election atmosphere will boost turnout among both the partisan base and previous non-voters, without any “moving to the center” at all.

Now something Democrats may have to contend with is the very high probability that the Trump 2020 campaign and the GOP will campaign against the nominee as an infanticide-supporting, anti-American, business-hating socialist, forcing Democrats into the false choice of either implicitly confirming those characterizations or pushing off them in a way that may discourage the Democratic base. A GOP campaign of insane negativity and unprincipled smears would be the perfectly predictable Trump M.O., and it also could work, as Hillary Clinton’s overconfident 2016 campaign learned.

How different candidates plan to deal with that challenge is a legitimate issue for primary voters, along with their plans to deal with a still-powerful Republican Party if they win. Everything we know about Sanders and his supporters suggests that he intends to overwhelm Trump by mobilizing a hidden majority that’s been waiting to support a progressive “political revolution” all along. Warren and other left-bent candidates may be more strategically flexible. And Biden, of course, has hitched his wagon to the older idea of “moving to the center” as a way to persuade swing voters. Even if you think (as I do) that this is an outmoded way of thinking that sacrifices too much ideological turf, if a majority of Democratic primary voters think that way, it could lift the former veep to the nomination, if not the presidency."

Bernie Sanders had heart surgery Tuesday night after experiencing pain in his chest at a campaign event earlier in the day, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement Wednesday. The 78-year-old Sanders had a blockage in one artery and had two stents inserted. He is now “conversing and in good spirits,” the statement said. All of his events and appearances have been canceled until further notice, and the campaign has reportedly begun canceling ad buys in Iowa, where it was due to begin airing its first TV ads of the campaign.

Sanders was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where he was due to appear at a gun-violence forum hosted by March for Our Lives and the Giffords group. He was due to visiting California later this week, followed by a trip to Iowa this weekend, the Times reported.

The oldest candidate in the race, Sanders was recently asked by Stephen Colbert about voters who may have concerns over his age. “I’m in good health and running a vigorous campaign,” he said after knocking on Colbert’s desk.

The full statement from Weaver reads: “During a campaign event yesterday evening, Sen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort. Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.”

After news of Sanders’s procedure, his fellow Democratic candidates sent their well wishes.

In a tweet, Joe Biden sent his best wishes, adding, “Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.”

Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.”

Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and others also tweeted their well wishes for the Vermont senator. So too did Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director. “All of us at @TeamTrump offer @BernieSanders,” he tweeted.

On Wednesday afternoon, Sanders tweeted that he’s “feeling good,” and underscored a central campaign message, reiterating his call for Medicare for All.

Thanks for all the well wishes. I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover.



None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All! — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 2, 2019

On Thursday, the campaign confirmed that Sanders will participate in the debate on October 15, and released an update stating that “there has been no need for additional procedures” following the initial surgery.

Even as contestants prepare for next week’s 12-candidate Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, the November event is beginning to come together as well, NBC News reports:

MSNBC and The Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia next month, MSNBC announced Tuesday.

The debate will take place in prime time on Nov. 20, and will air live on MSNBC and Radio One. It will also stream on MSNBC.com and the Post’s website, as well as across mobile devices via NBC News and the Post’s mobile apps and Urban One’s digital platforms.

The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.

The Democratic National Committee toughened the polling and fundraising thresholds for this fifth debate, as I noted last month:

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states …

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems.

At this point, eight candidates have qualified for the November stage: the aforementioned five polling champs, plus Cory Booker, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang (who got his fourth qualifying poll just today). Others have until November 13 to make the cut. As Politico reports, it’s looking a bit dicey for some, including four who will be on the stage in Ohio next week:

Currently, more than a dozen candidates are still short of the qualification thresholds, including four who will be on stage next week in Ohio: Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke. Those four have all said they’ve cleared the 165,000 donor threshold required for the debate, but each needs at least three more 3-percent polls to qualify.

It would be a good time for the October debaters who are November non-qualifiers to make a splash."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, what last night’s debate tells us about the Democratic field.

Last night was the first Democratic primary debate since Congress opened its official impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump. Did that change anything?

The opening question, a softball about impeachment, allowed every last one of the 12 candidates on the overcrowded stage to tell us what we already know: They are all for it! So the advent of the impeachment inquiry per se didn’t change anything. But once we moved beyond that dull panorama of like-mindedness, this turned out to be a clarifying debate. By that I don’t mean it was an exciting debate, or an inspiring debate, or a debate that would draw in those Americans (most of them) who don’t want to think about 2020 politics before we get to 2020. But the shape of the Democratic field now seems crystal clear. Tuesday night seemed like a death knell for seven of the dozen candidacies on stage, including Joe Biden’s. It’s time for the actual contenders to go at it on a less cluttered field.

Among the seven also-rans, the low-hanging losers are Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer (we hardly knew ye), the billionaire vanity candidate whose main attribute is that at least he is not Howard Schultz. Their time to gain traction in this cycle has come and gone. Obviously O’Rourke and Castro are future prospects, though it may take a while for some Democrats to forgive O’Rourke for his vainglorious decision to run for president rather than to challenge the incumbent John Cornyn in next year’s Texas Senate race.

Cory Booker and Biden, two candidates who’ve always looked highly plausible in theory but repeatedly fail to deliver, are more complicated cases.

Booker is sunny and personable — as unobjectionable as an easy-listening radio host. His upbeat, why-can’t-we-all-get-along shtick is surely sincere, but it’s part of the reason why he’s never risen in the polls: It comes off as empty bombast — cheery bombast, to be sure, but no substitute for substance. In a dark time, voters are not looking for a “politics of joy,” to recall the thesis of Hubert Humphrey’s ill-fated campaign in 1968. And they aren’t looking for rage, a market that has been cornered by Trump in any event. What they are looking for is fight. Booker has yet to show that he has much of that, despite his periodic pumping up of his mellifluous voice to simulate fisticuffs.

In last night’s debate, he also revealed just how hard it is for him to depart from his over-polished prefab scripts. It was somewhat embarrassing when, in an obviously planned bit of grandstanding, he (politely) chastised his rivals for neglecting to talk about how much women’s reproductive rights are under attack — only moments after Kamala Harris had made the exact same point, and stirringly so. Booker’s attempt to concede that she’d upstaged him was awkward (a patronizing “God bless Kamala!”) as was his effort to draw a distinction by congratulating himself on being a man who cares about women’s reproductive rights. (It was just grating enough to recall his mortifying “I am Spartacus” gambit during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.) In another demonstration of his lack of intellectual agility, he glowingly quoted the former Trump defense secretary, Jim Mattis, while making no reference to Mattis’s recently much-discussed cowardice in failing to speak up about the White House horrors that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

Biden also lacks that intellectual agility. He didn’t repeat the viral glitches of the previous debates. But that’s a low bar to rise above. Like Booker, he seems incapable of the improvisational moves necessary to take on Trump. He ducked a question about why it was okay for Hunter Biden to trade on his name for cushy foreign paydays, however lawfully, and instead repeated an anodyne soundbite three times (“My son’s statement speaks for itself”). This was a lost opportunity because Biden might have joined other Democrats in denouncing the nepotistic follies of his hypocritical Republican critics, notably Donald Trump Jr., Rand Paul, and Liz Cheney. And he might have passionately lit into the criminal White House conspiracy to strongarm foreign governments to soil him and his son. After all, Trump’s assault on the Bidens is the best argument for his candidacy — it makes the case that Joe Biden is the candidate Trump fears the most. But unaccountably Biden has made only fitful use of this political gift horse in the weeks since the Ukraine scandal became front-page news — even as his campaign’s fundraising has wilted.

There were other examples of his lack of improvisational skills as well. After delivering a meaty tirade against the outrage of Trump’s surrender to Erdogan and Assad, he ducked the question of whether he’d send American troops back into the region. He couldn’t stop himself from repeating more than once his newly favored shtick (intended as a stab at Warren) trumpeting himself as the only candidate who’s gotten anything done. That claim is not only false, but is wielded as a dodge to avoid any treacherous policy question. Worse, it left him open to this memorable riposte from Bernie Sanders: “You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.” Sanders damaged Biden in a less explicit way as well. Post–heart attack, he seemed looser, sharper, and less programmed than he did pre–heart attack. He seems younger than Biden though in fact he’s two years his senior. Who would have ever imagined that Bernie Sanders could be a comeback kid?

Among the others still left standing, Kamala Harris remains an enigma. She’s a sharp and tireless prosecutor (as she never hesitates to remind us), capable of real fire when she’s passionate about the subject at hand. But she’s just as often studied and cautious, and you have to wonder about her political acuity when she marshals her considerable resources to push such a marginal, Bay Area–centric crusade as calling upon Twitter to suspend Trump’s account.

As nearly everyone has noted, the two who did themselves the most good last night were Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who seized the initiative and poked holes in the best-laid Medicare for All plans of front-runner Elizabeth Warren. Their blows, respectful but firm, landed.

For the first time in a debate, Warren occasionally seemed defensive and misspoke. She will not be able to get away indefinitely with stonewalling Buttigieg’s “yes or no question” about whether her health plan mandates tax increases. At another point, she could be found self-righteously claiming that “everyone else on this stage” wants to protect billionaires even though, as Klobuchar pointed out, even the one billionaire onstage, Steyer, had come out against protecting billionaires.

As of now, Warren remains the best candidate the Democrats have, but she hasn’t closed the deal, and there are plausible alternatives. Talking heads at CNN and elsewhere relentlessly promoted last night’s debate as historic because it was the most presidential candidates ever on a debate stage. But only after a ruthless culling will the campaign finally begin in earnest and real history be made.

But what about Michael Bloomberg? He has begun to float the idea of entering the Democratic primary as a centrist option if Biden falters. Would he be a contender?

At 77, he would at last remedy a glaring shortcoming of the septuagenarian Democratic field by filling the age gap between Biden (76) and Sanders (78). And it would be highly gratifying to see a genuinely successful and accomplished New York billionaire go up against the fraud in the White House. He might drive Trump crazy — that is, crazier — and he could be self-financing to an extent.

The downside? Trump’s revenge, make no mistake about it, would be to further stoke anti-Semitism among his alt-right stormtroopers. And should either Buttigieg, Klobuchar, or Harris catch fire with Biden’s up-for-grabs constituency, a tardy Bloomberg candidacy would be fighting a two-front war against opponents both in the party’s center and on the left. If he really wants to get in when Biden falters, someone should tell him that that time has arrived."

It was obvious to anyone who’d been paying attention heading into Tuesday night’s debate that Elizabeth Warren — now the front-runner in Democrats’ presidential nominating contest — would get her share of heat from her competitors. But in the final moments before game time, as CNN’s panelists discussed their expectations, David Axelrod made a narrower prediction. It would be a problem, he said, for Pete Buttigieg if the South Bend mayor didn’t target Warren, after all the work he’d been doing to preview that attack — most prominently debuting a new ad on Tuesday — in recent days.

The viewers who were watching Buttigieg closely knew exactly what Axelrod was talking about. Three hours later, the rest of the country has now also seen a punchier Buttigieg than ever before, as he makes a risky wager — a bet on a largely new campaign tack — that could define the trajectory of his candidacy.

Over the course of the debate in suburban Columbus, Buttigieg clashed with Warren over the details of her Medicare for All support and her plan to pay for it. But he did not reserve his fire exclusively for Warren. He also disagreed vehemently with Tulsi Gabbard over Middle East policy, and ripped into Beto O’Rourke over his position on an assault-weapon buyback plan — perhaps the tensest exchange of the night (“I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or otherwise,” the mayor said).

It was a break from the more mild-mannered Buttigieg voters had gotten to know over the first four debates, and over his first ten months in the national eye. This candidate, eager to look like a truth-teller and get in the mix as the bigger-name contenders wage ideological war, has sharper elbows than the version who’s quietly been building up his Iowa operation in recent months. It’s all part of a bet he’s making that drawing these kinds of stark contrasts now — just as more voters tune into the race, and just as Warren surges — can position him to be an alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters, or that it can at least vault him from the floor of the race’s top tier, alongside Kamala Harris, to somewhere in the vicinity of Bernie Sanders’s third-place status.

But his gambit is far from straightforward.

By turning a fight with Warren into one of his centerpiece moments in the national eye, Buttigieg is also gambling that undecided voters now actually want to see this kind of disagreement, even after the last three candidates to try and make such striking attacks on stage — Harris, Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, all on Biden — saw no long-term polling gain. He’s hoping that it doesn’t tank his support among the slice of progressives that has been willing to give him a look. And it’s based on an expectation that voters who have gotten to like Buttigieg’s brand of low-key moderation and calls for generational change won’t rebel against these kinds of explicit critiques of his rivals.

Buttigieg and Democrats around him have been most eager to pick the health-care fight, according to multiple people in his orbit. Though he’d found himself clashing with Warren supporters in the last week for labeling grassroots donations “pocket change” in a recent interview while making a point about general-election fundraising strategy, and though he’d engaged in a back-and-forth with O’Rourke — who trails him in most polling — over gun policy, he has been trying to put himself more forcefully in the middle of the health-care fight with ads in early-voting Iowa touting his own alternative to Medicare for All. It’s a strategy he’s following more successfully than others who’ve tried a version of it, like Steve Bullock, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, and John Delaney.

Those close to Buttigieg are fond of pointing to a late September Des Moines Register poll demonstrating fear among some Democratic caucus-goers that Medicare for All could cost the party in the general election, and on Tuesday Buttigieg released a digital ad criticizing Sanders and Warren by name while touting his own plan. It was the first candidate ad of the cycle directly going after named opponents, and Buttigieg onstage accused Warren of being evasive over her plan’s funding, a reflection, he said, of “why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.”

Buttigieg isn’t the only candidate whose path ahead relies on Biden faltering. But in order to truly take Biden’s place at some point, he’d need to massively expand his support among both African-American voters and Democrats who aren’t yet fully engaged in the primary — two groups that have been Biden’s core supporters, but with whom Buttigieg has struggled. He’s now committed himself to a future firmly within that lane, with little wiggle room after he said onstage that Warren’s and Sanders’s health-care proposals would “unnecessarily divide this country” in a post-Trump world. Some of the fury that has long come Biden’s way from progressives fed up with his centrism is now certainly headed Buttigieg’s way.

To hear his allies tell it, Buttigieg’s new strategy makes sense because voters are now demanding clarity on what divides the candidates, and they’ll appreciate his new assertiveness. That may make the difference between his position in the top five and a place in the top three. It will, at the very least, determine whether the hopeful candidate who’s tried to spur a generational revolution can now credibly convince people to think of him as the moderate hope."

The operation demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the schisms within the Democratic Party as it labors to choose a nominee to face Trump in 2020. One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues. Some of the accounts boosted one of his rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

The Russian network was the subject of one of four takedowns Facebook announced Monday; it also disabled three misleading campaigns originating in Iran. Researchers said the efforts demonstrated how those seeking to interfere in U.S. politics continue to exploit radioactive topics, including racial and religious fault lines. And they said it offered fresh evidence that foreign actors are pursuing new platforms that rely on a steady stream of images, making detection more difficult despite Facebook’s heightened investments in election security.

“We are seeing again that the aim of the Russians is not exclusively to favor one candidate over another but to create divisiveness within the electorate overall,” said Paul M. Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. “The reason that networks of phony accounts are drawn to Instagram is because disinformation is increasingly visual in nature, and that’s what Instagram specializes in.”

The disclosure from Facebook served as more evidence of what Trump has repeatedly questioned — that Russian actors not only interfered in the 2016 election but are continuing their efforts to interfere in American democracy. The task of safeguarding U.S. elections from interference by Russia and other foreign actors has been a source of tension in the Trump administration, with the president repeatedly calling the allegations of Russian involvement in 2016 a “hoax” and top security officials being forced to tiptoe around the issue.

Multiple U.S. investigations have confirmed the extent of Russia’s attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III obtained multiple indictments last year of individuals affiliated with the Internet Research Agency. This month, a bipartisan report produced by Senate investigators concluded again that the Russian effort sought to boost Trump and undermine Clinton in the eyes of social media users.

Speaking to The Washington Post last week, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the problem posed by disinformation has worsened since 2016, and he attributed that in part to a poor initial response by the U.S. government to the threat. “Unfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016,” he said, “so it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too.”

Facebook’s announcements came two days before Zuckerberg is set to appear on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are likely to press him on the company’s work to safeguard U.S. elections from foreign manipulation. Members of Congress have upbraided the tech giant for missing key warning signs of Russian interference before the 2016 election, then failing to acknowledge the Kremlin’s activities immediately after the fact.

Zuckerberg said in an interview last week that Facebook is in a “much better place now” to stop disinformation campaigns, citing the company’s investments in tens of thousands of new staff hires and artificial intelligence that can spot fake accounts and dubious posts in real time. The company further fine-tuned its policies Monday, pledging to more prominently alert users when viral content is determined to be false. Announcing the changes, Zuckerberg stressed he now has “some confidence our systems here are working.”

“Elections have changed significantly since 2016,” he told reporters, “and Facebook has changed, too.”

Researchers said Facebook — in spotting and disclosing the Russian network Monday faster than it had in the past — demonstrated it had improved its digital defenses. Companies such as Facebook are “building muscle memory around understanding malicious actors on their platform,” said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.

But Brookie said Facebook’s takedown showed that Russia’s tactics would continue to evolve as well. “To steal a phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, and meme-based content is still extremely effective and much harder to detect,” he said.

The Biden campaign applauded Facebook for disabling the fake accounts but said Trump’s penchant for falsehoods posed just as great a challenge for the company, which has refused to fact-check political advertising placed by the president’s reelection campaign.

“Unfortunately, like the Kremlin, Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, [and] all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform,” TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump’s ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.”

Facebook described the Russian network as a “well-resourced operation” focused on the United States and reliant on sophisticated steps to conceal the identity and location of those behind the fake accounts. It comprised 50 accounts on Instagram and one on Facebook, all of them created this year.

The network appeared still to be in an audience-building phase when it was removed by Facebook: 246,000 accounts followed one or more of the inauthentic Russian accounts, which had collectively made just fewer than 75,000 posts, according to a report from Graphika, a social media analysis firm that examined the operation for Facebook. Only one account, which addressed environmental themes, had more than 20,000 followers.

AD

AD

Much of the content lacked text, consisting only of memes, and the posts often drew from viral content first posted by American actors, including news organizations and prominent political figures, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

The accounts had not yet developed their own voice, which analysts say is critical to achieving a mass following.

“These accounts were trying really hard to hide,” said Ben Nimmo, Graphika’s director of investigations. “The more you try to blend in, the less you stand out. And the less you stand out, the less you’re going to attract an audience. It looks like these accounts were sacrificing engagement for security. That’s a very defensive strategy.”

AD

Nimmo said Facebook’s action was at least the fourth takedown since 2017 of operations targeting the United States that seemed to bear links to the Internet Research Agency. The apparent connection to the St. Petersburg company and “troll farm,” owned by an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, went beyond overlap with the thematic focus and targets of past Kremlin-backed campaigns. Some of the accounts taken down Monday had posted memes already attributed to previous IRA efforts — but had sought to rebuild them from scratch, rather than simply reposting them, and had made attempts to remove the original IRA watermarks.

AD

A minority of the posts focused explicitly on the 2020 election, according to Graphika’s analysis. Among the accounts posing as backers of political and social causes in the United States, the largest cluster was conservative and in support of Trump. Numerous accounts aimed their fire at Democratic candidates — namely Biden but also Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Other issues included racial activism, Confederate pride, gun rights, LGBT issues, feminism, Islam and Christianity.

Nearly half of the accounts claimed to be based in swing states, with a specific focus on Florida.

AD

Biden came under attack from accounts that positioned themselves on both sides of the political spectrum. One account reposted a tweet from a right-wing political commentator parroting a Trump rebuke of Biden, while another posted a meme showing a road diverging and a car swerving to choose the path representing “Bernie 2020” over “Joe Biden.” Four years earlier, Russian-backed Facebook accounts similarly promoted Sanders during the Democratic primary against Clinton, according to Senate investigators."

Intelligencer staffers Gabriel Debenedetti and Benjamin Hart discuss the possible ramifications of Bernie Sanders’s heart procedure and temporary campaign suspension.

Ben: Bernie Sanders’s campaign revealed today that the 78-year-old Vermont senator underwent a procedure for a blocked artery after experiencing tightness in his chest Tuesday evening. His wife, Jane Sanders, says he is doing “really well,” and there is no indication that more serious health problems are involved. But this is obviously news his supporters don’t want to hear. Do you have an initial sense of how the incident will affect his campaign?

Gabriel: We have no idea how this will affect the campaign, and I’m not sure the campaign does yet, either. In terms of the short-term mechanics, we know Sanders has canceled his upcoming events, and his campaign has postponed its big recent ad buy in Iowa, which was supposed to be a big moment for it. Obviously this isn’t good, but I’d caution against drawing too many conclusions here.

Purely in terms of political momentum, you clearly don’t want your candidate off the trail and off the air at an important moment. But I’m pretty sure most Democratic voters understand the circumstances.

Ben: Voters may understand that Bernie is old, but Joe Biden is the candidate whose age has been more front and center as a possible drawback. Bernie, while older than Biden, has maintained a breakneck campaign schedule and has appeared not to lose a step in the process. Won’t this put a pretty major dent in that image?

Gabriel: What I meant isn’t that voters understand his age, but that they understand there’s a completely understandable reason for his absence from the trail. I don’t want to speculate too much on the potential political fallout here because we just don’t have any idea what the prognosis is, what Sanders’s plan is, or, really, anything. I’d love more information, but clearly the people around him are being very cautious, and that’s extremely understandable. I’m happy to engage more directly with part of the question, though. Not only has Sanders had a breakneck campaign schedule in 2019, he’s had a basically insane schedule since late 2015. He’s been traveling the country more or less nonstop, and his stamina on the trail has always impressed his aides and the reporters who follow him.

Ben: Indeed, I’ve seen some testaments to that on Twitter.

Gabriel: I can attest to it personally!

Ben: Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “My friend @sensanders has always been a strong partner in the Senate. Wishing him a speedy recovery so he can get back in the fight.” Presumably rival candidates will tread extremely carefully around this news.

Gabriel: Of course. I’ve seen similar tweets or statements from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Julián Castro, Tom Steyer, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, Tim Ryan, Joe Sestak, Tulsi Gabbard, and John Delaney. And, by the way, Trump’s reelection communications director Tim Murtaugh, too. There’s no realistic world in which candidates try to make political hay out of this moment."

Around halfway through the fourth Democratic debate, middle-of-the-packers Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke engaged in a heated exchange over O’Rourke’s mandatory buyback proposal for assault weapons. After the former Texas rep criticized the South Bend mayor’s more moderate policies on gun reform, Buttigieg responded that he did not “need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,” perhaps alluding to his military service as a greater sacrifice than Beto’s great Gen X Battle of Making It in New York.

O’Rourke — who has prioritized gun reform following the El Paso shooting in August — then brought up Buttigieg’s insult from a gun-safety forum in Las Vegas earlier in October, when he called O’Rourke’s policy a “shiny object,” claiming that prior gun-buyback attempts had largely resulted in handovers of antiques and heirlooms. Addressing the earlier dig, O’Rourke said:

Mayor Buttigieg described this policy as a shiny object. I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but for those who have survived gun violence, those who have lost a loved one to an AR-15 or an AK-47 — March for Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians — that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass-casualty assault … They must buy them back.

The field also weighed in on the issue: Amy Klobuchar, like Buttigieg, vowed to pursue policies with popular support, like the boyfriend loophole. Elizabeth Warren supported voluntary gun buybacks, while Kamala Harris repeated her call for mandatory buybacks.

Julián Castro closed the topic with a strong statement on his problems with mandatory buybacks: that “folks can’t define it,” and that the increased contact with police that could be required by such a policy would represent a danger to black and brown communities:

In the places that I grew up in, we weren’t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. Y’all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at two in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn’t even announce himself, and within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home. And so I’m not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

Tuesday night marks the fourth debate on the primary calendar — meaning there are only eight more to go in the Democratic primary race. Unlike last month’s debate, the event on October 15 expands the field, with 12 candidates onstage, including one new challenger.

What Time Is the Democratic Debate?

Hosted by Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio, the festivities will start at 8 p.m. ET and drag on until 11 p.m.

What Channel has the Democratic Debate?

Co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times, the debate will be available for streaming — without requiring a cable-provider log-in — at CNN.com, the New York Times mobile app, and on Facebook.

What is the Democratic Debate Lineup?

The candidates will appear onstage, from left to right, as follows:

Tulsi Gabbard

Tom Steyer

Cory Booker

Kamala Harris

Bernie Sanders

Joe Biden

Elizabeth Warren

Pete Buttigieg

Andrew Yang

Beto O’Rourke

Amy Klobuchar

Julián Castro

Like last debate, Biden is flanked by the two progressives closest in the polls; unlike last debate, Warren has surpassed the former vice-president in at least one poll, making his front-runner status no longer unanimous.

How’d They Decide Who Made the Cut?

To qualify for the debate, the Democratic National Committee determined that Democrats had to receive contributions from a minimum of 130,000 donors and had to register at least 2 percent of support in four DNC-approved polls. Because the qualifications did not increase in difficulty between September and October, candidates had more time to reach the donation and polling requirements — thus, the inclusion of Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire impeachment enthusiast Tom Steyer.

Who Are the Moderators for the Democratic Debate?

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, CNN anchor Erin Burnett, and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey.

The I-Word Looming Over the Debate

A drastic political change has occurred since the last debate: House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president’s quid pro quo pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of the former vice-president’s son Hunter Biden. And though a potential impeachment proceeding could benefit Democrats in the long run — just over half of voters support the president’s removal, according to a recent Fox News poll — the scandal will be complicate the debate, as New York’s Ed Kilgore notes:

In talking about Trump and impeachment, the candidates vying to become his vanquisher in November 2020 are in the awkward position of discussing and promoting an event that would make their own competition wildly different if not irrelevant. What are they supposed to do? Boast of how they will tear Mike Pence a new one? Make the general election a referendum on why it took Republicans so long to abandon their corrupt leader? It’s a tough set of questions — again, for moderators as well as for debaters.

If any of the debaters … go after Hunter [Biden], his father could very well exploit the moment to depict himself as the victim of an infamous Trump smear, and also as the candidate Trump fears enough to risk impeachment to smear. Suffice it to say there is some nervous debate prep under way on the subject.

When Is the Next Democratic Debate?

Held on Wednesday, November 20, in Georgia and hosted by MSNBC, the threshold for the next debate went up, as candidates will have to clear 3 percent in at least four national polls — or polls in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — in addition to 160,000 donors. Despite the raised admission point, the debate will still be packed: Candidates who have made the fifth debate thus far include Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Steyer, Warren, and Yang."

Kamala Harris

Democratic candidate

Harris rose rapidly in California politics, from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general to U.S. senator. Democrats celebrated her sharp questions for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh during his emotional 2018 confirmation process, but many are skeptical of her record as attorney general — which included defending California’s death penalty and advocating for a controversial truancy policy. Harris, 54, would become the first woman, the first person of Asian heritage and the first black woman to be president.

In a primary field chock full of big ideas, Harris hopes her “3 a.m. agenda” will show middle-class Americans that she is the one they can count on to deliver results. Her poll numbers rose after the first Democratic presidential debate, in which she confronted former vice president Joe Biden about his record on race, segregation and school busing. Since then, she has fallen back. Harris is now investing heavily in Iowa, hoping for a strong performance there in February."

AD

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) — who last week bought a Facebook ad claiming, in jest, that the platform had endorsed President Trump — reiterated her call Tuesday to break up what she called “monopolists” in Silicon Valley and pressed her rivals in Tuesday’s debate to forgo donations from “the big tech executives.” Even former tech executive Andrew Yang expressed a desire to find “the best way we can fight back against big tech companies.”

AD

The unanimity of criticism of Big Tech marked a sharp turnabout from 2008, when a then-young social media platform, Facebook, was skillfully deployed to help elect Barack Obama president. Those warm feelings are long past, damaged by Facebook’s role in spreading disinformation against Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign and its refusal to act more aggressively against viral falsehoods in this election season.

The growing frustration with Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers threatens to put the industry in the crosshairs of a future Democratic White House should the party prevail in 2020. Warren’s call for the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon has generated backlash within the industry, most visibly when Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees in July that he would “go to the mat … and fight” such an effort in court.

AD

“Facebook was a company that was incredibly popular among the public writ large, and particularly liberals, prior to 2016. It now ranks with tobacco companies, oil companies and the NRA in driving Democratic anger,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under Obama, whose use of Facebook in the 2008 campaign gave early hints of its power as a political organizing tool.

AD

Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the growing Democratic disaffection with Silicon Valley. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Democrats’ animosity has only grown in response to Zuckerberg’s recent courtship of conservatives, including dinners and other private meetings with right-leaning pundits and lawmakers — all at a time when some of Facebook’s most visible leaders in Washington are conservatives, too.

AD

Katie Harbath, a former Republican strategist, including for Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, is the company’s public policy director for global elections. Facebook’s vice president for global public policy is Joel Kaplan, a veteran of the George W. Bush White House who, last year, sat two rows behind then-U.S. Appeals Court Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he denied allegations of sexual misconduct before Congress and battled successfully for a seat on the Supreme Court.

AD

Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has huddled with prominent conservatives, including Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), who oversees tech issues as chairman of his chamber’s Judiciary Committee. The dinners, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the private conversations, marked Facebook’s latest efforts to try to shore up support with influential political figures on the right who at times have criticized Silicon Valley for targeting Republicans unfairly.

But the meetings, first reported by Politico, sparked immediate Democratic outrage, including a campaign on Twitter to get users to quit Facebook, under the hashtag #deletefacebook. The report also drew a rare, testy response from Zuckerberg himself, who posted on his Facebook profile that he has dinners with officials on all sides of the political spectrum. “Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,” he wrote. “If you haven’t tried it, I suggest you do!”

AD

Polls this year have found that large swaths of the American public are skeptical of leading technology companies. A Fox News poll in June asking whether Facebook had “too much power” found agreement from roughly three out of five Americans, with little variation based on race, income level, age, gender, region or party affiliation.

AD

Distaste for major technology companies among conservatives has been obvious for years, with many Republicans — and especially Trump — bashing the industry for unproven allegations of liberal bias in moderating their platforms. They began voicing this critique forcefully ahead of the 2016 vote, leading to a summit in which top executives hosted prominent conservatives at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.

For Democrats, though, the shift in opinion followed the 2016 election, when Russian operatives used the platform and other social media to spread viral falsehoods, exposing major weaknesses at Facebook that domestic and foreign sources continue to exploit to this day.

AD

“I think that these companies have accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish, and that is a bipartisan, bad mood, with the word ‘antitrust’ being thrown around,” said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley.

AD

Just how deeply major technology companies have fallen out of favor with Democrats was evident Tuesday as 12 of the party’s presidential aspirants took the stage outside of Columbus, Ohio. That a section of the three-hour dialogue was devoted to technology was on its own a sign of the shifting views of a party that once used Facebook and Google’s YouTube video service to elevate the country’s “first social media president,” as Obama was known.

Eric Schmidt, a top Google executive, was a visible supporter of Obama, and the company’s alumni filled key roles in his White House. The industry also was a major source of money for Democrats. Donors in the communications and electronics sectors overwhelmingly backed Clinton in 2016, contributing roughly $62 million to her campaign and outside groups compared with roughly $7 million for Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.

AD

During a town hall at Facebook’s headquarters in the spring of 2011, Obama extolled Facebook for fostering “dialogue,” creating the conditions for a “healthy democracy.” The Obama-era optimism about social media was reflected globally, with “Facebook revolutions” unfolding from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, from Tehran to Bucharest to Lower Manhattan.

AD

No longer do Democrats cast Internet dwellers as engaged, enlightened citizens, however. Rather, in the words of Beto O’Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, they represent the “product” for social media platforms, which “abuse that public trust … at extraordinary profits.”

For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), the problem stems from the current occupant of the Oval Office, who commands a massive online following, with more than 65 million users tracking the president’s comments — many of them attacks on real and perceived rivals — on Twitter. Harris has asked Twitter to suspend Trump’s account for violations of its policies against harassment and hateful conduct. The platform has declined to do so, but on Tuesday clarified the rare instances in which it would take action against world leaders.

AD

Twitter also joined Facebook and Google in refusing a request by the campaign of Joe Biden, the former vice president, to stop airing an advertisement that made false claims about him and his son’s actions in Ukraine.

AD

That refusal — in contrast with CNN’s decision not to air the ad, and NBCUniversal’s move to stop airing it — has enraged Democrats and fueled calls for more regulation of campaign speech, putting the party starkly at odds with most of Silicon Valley. Facebook officials explicitly exempt the ads and other “direct speech” by politicians from their system of fact-checking, the creation of which was a key reform after Russians and others flooded Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram and other social media platforms with disinformation in 2016.

Warren’s call on Democrats to forgo fundraising in Silicon Valley has not yet caught on. The San Francisco Bay area has been a frequent fundraising stop for Harris as well as for Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom remained quiet during the exchange during the debate on the power of Silicon Valley.

Even the candidates who don’t take contributions from Silicon Valley have still poured money into the companies based there, in the form of digital advertising. The Democratic presidential contenders have spent roughly $5 million on Facebook ads alone during a three-week period ending Oct. 5, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy.

With a fourth Democratic candidates’ debate in the books, and many observers becoming impatient about some of the remaining 19 White House aspirants dropping out, guessing games will ensue about who will drop out next. At least one candidate, Julián Castro, has invited that sort of scrutiny with a fundraising appeal linked to a threat to quit:

(Castro has secured needed 165,000 grassroots contributions, campaign needs to meet polling threshold and says $$$ needed to get there) — Steadman™ (@AsteadWesley) October 21, 2019

This sort of gambit worked for Cory Booker in September, so maybe Castro can get his loyalists to cough up some more dough in time to make the next stage. But soon some candidates who haven’t been doing well may calculate that they might as well stick around until voters start voting, at which point denying the obvious will become vastly more difficult. Later this week we’ll hit the 100-day milepost before the February 3 Iowa caucuses. So instead of trying to figure out who ought to quit earlier than that — today, or maybe even yesterday — a more useful exercise is to project which candidates cannot credibly survive a bad showing in the very first contest. It’s a variation on the old “how many tickets are there out of Iowa?” puzzle that the chattering classes have played for decades.

The “Big Three” Should Be All Right Unless They Totally Fall Apart

The candidates who have dominated the early going in Iowa and elsewhere, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, all have strong national followings, distinct identities, and good fundraising operations. Short of some horrid mistake that produces a free fall in support in Iowa and elsewhere, they all have enough of a national base and a plausible path to the nomination that a post-Iowa comeback is possible even if they underwhelm a bit in the caucuses. It’s also possible, of course, that one of the Big Three will decide winning Iowa is the ball game and will empty the bank account trying to do so. That’s what Hillary Clinton did in 2008. And her third-place showing in Iowa might have finished her had she not pulled a shocking upset win in New Hampshire just five days later.

Mayor Pete Really Needs Some Iowa Magic

Recent polling in Iowa has shown Pete Buttigieg doing quite well, consistently running third or fourth. But given the nature of his base of support, he absolutely needs to do quite well in both Iowa and New Hampshire; later on, his struggle to win over minority voters could become fatal to his candidacy if he hasn’t already established himself as viable. Since his current strategy appears to be to position himself as the “moderate alternative” to Joe Biden, Mayor Pete’s best path to the nomination is to beat Biden in Iowa and then begin to make himself the strongest moderate in the race, particularly if Warren and Sanders continue to fight it out for supremacy among progressive voters.

Bennet, Beto, Booker, Bullock, Klobuchar, and Probably Harris Are Iowa-or-Bust Candidates

There are quite a few White House aspirants who will likely have to (or need to) drop out if they don’t finish really well in Iowa. The most obvious is Amy Klobuchar, whose proximity to the First-in-the-Nation Caucus State has been central to her candidacy all along. Like fellow Minnesotans Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann (briefly viable in 2012 on the Republican side) and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (who dropped out in 2016 after polling poorly in Iowa), Klobuchar isn’t going to convince voters anywhere else she’s worth considering if she can’t win over her neighbors.

Colorado senator Michael Bennet and Montana governor Steve Bullock are also from relatively near Iowa and have spent significant time there. They also have in common that they are part of the crowd of candidates (along with Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris) who have been auditioning to become moderate alternatives to Joe Biden. Since neither has been on a debate stage since July, it’s hard to imagine their highly theoretical rationales for candidacy surviving a poor or even meh showing in Iowa.

The same is likely true of Beto O’Rourke, whose early fundraising and high name ID, and then a modest revival after the gun massacre in his hometown, have given him more staying power. But once voters vote, his long-standing “potential” may be used up.

Booker built one of the strongest early organizations in Iowa, and given the fact that he has no other states to fall back on if he falters there, he, too, should be good or gone after February 3. And you can make a strong case that Harris, briefly a world-beater after a strong first-debate performance, has to finish in the money in Iowa as well, after she decided to focus her entire candidacy on an Obama-style breakthrough there. Conversely, Biden can clear out a lot of potential moderate-lane and African-American competition if he badly beats all these rivals in Iowa, which is a good reason for him to keep spending time there despite having stronger support elsewhere.

Steyer and Yang May Be Impervious to a Bad Showing

Tom Steyer, I am sure, wants to do well in Iowa as much as anyone else. But he has the resources to survive a poor finish there, and in quite a few other states as well, so long as he doesn’t become too discouraged to go on. Andrew Yang is a niche candidate who has already exceeded every reasonable expectation, without raising those expectations above what he can accomplish. He’s raising money pretty well, too, and has no particular geographical base, so why should he drop out after Iowa?

Perhaps Tulsi Gabbard is a niche candidate, too: sort of the Dennis Kucinich of the 2020 cycle, with an ideological positioning that probably secures a hard kernel of support. But it’s unclear whether she has the appetite for that kind of quixotic run. As for Castro, his path to the nomination depends on making it to Nevada, where he could in theory draw on support from fellow Latinos, but it’s doubtful he can survive until then.

Candidates Who Are Going Nowhere Anyway Can Meander On After Iowa

Some of the above candidates, of course, and several others who have made less of a mark on the contest, can keep going on a sort of energy-saver mode after doing poorly in Iowa because they don’t need a lot of money or support to hang around and/or don’t have time-consuming day jobs. The model for this kind of sort-of candidacy is provided by Miramar, Florida, mayor Wayne Messam, who is not raising or spending much of anything. A livelier version of the eternal candidate may be Marianne Williamson, who has pretty good name ID and some fundraising ability, along with no discernible path to the nomination that she can screw up with a poor performance in Iowa or anywhere else. If she wants to stick around, she can. The very wealthy John Delaney is a sort of Tom Steyer with less money and a lot less support. And who knows why Tim Ryan is still in the race (though focusing most of his attention on his real campaign, the one for reelection to the House) — or Joe Sestak?

So to get back to the perennial question, how many tickets out of Iowa are there likely to be, counting only candidates who are truly viable? The traditional answer has always been three. For the reasons cited earlier, there will probably be four tickets out of Iowa this time around: the Big Three plus some lucky dark horse aiming for Biden’s vote, minority voters, or some sweet spot in the center of the party."

It’s been an unsettling few weeks for the Joe Biden campaign. As recently as last month, his people were describing a strategy for the nomination contest in which the former veep, with his universal name ID and relatively broad base of voters and donors, would outlast multiple candidates in a “dogfight” that wouldn’t really sort itself out until well down the road. But in the wake of Elizabeth Warren’s polling surge, particularly in the early states, along with a weakening of Biden’s position, the spin from his campaign has subtly shifted, as reflected in this report from Politico:

Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in the Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March.

The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling numbers have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where she’s heavily invested in field organization …

[I]n the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden.

Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-Americans and more-moderate Democrats.

What this really means is that Team Biden is afraid he’s going to get skunked by Warren in the early states (or at least in three of them; he’s still doing well in South Carolina). Unsurprisingly, its story is that the real fight will begin later, once it has all boiled down to a two-candidate race centered in states where Warren’s upscale white lefty base isn’t as dominant. So don’t look at Biden’s falling poll numbers in Iowa or New Hampshire as meaning much; it’s all just an elimination contest in which Biden has a bye and a ticket to the finals.

This makes some sense, although it’s also reminiscent of what we’ve heard over the years from failed candidates who tried to stage a “comeback” or build a “firewall” after losing early. This dates to the beginning of the modern primary-dominated Democratic nominating contest, with an “ABM” (Anybody But McGovern) rallying cry in 1972 and an “ABC” (Anybody But Carter) effort in 1976 and 1980. There was similar talk on the Republican side in 2016, when someone was forever going to beat Donald Trump in the late going. Truth is, particularly for Democrats, a win in Iowa or New Hampshire has been a condition precedent for recent nomination wins, with the asterisked exception of Bill Clinton ’92, who didn’t really compete in Iowa because favorite son Tom Harkin took the state right off the table.

It is also true that Biden is particularly ill suited for Iowa and New Hampshire, states with strong progressive activist traditions and few of the African-Americans so central to his coalition. But the strategic questions for him are (1) whether the early states produce a competitor for him among party moderates and/or minority voters, and (2) whether early wins blow up someone like Warren into a world-beater who simply cannot be stopped.

So far, Biden has been very lucky that no other “moderate” or black candidate has gotten a lot of traction. Kamala Harris, who showed some potential to appeal both to white moderates and to fellow minorities, is increasingly being perceived as a Democratic Marco Rubio — all potential but no performance. Cory Booker is down in the low single digits everywhere. Pete Buttigieg has raised a lot of money and built some buzz but, unlike other white candidates, seems to have a real problem with black voters. Amy Klobuchar’s proximity to Iowa and excellent electoral history haven’t lifted her into contention. Beto O’Rourke is lucky to still be in the race, and Andrew Yang is sui generis and not yet demonstrating any path to the nomination.

But Biden’s biggest fear is that if Warren wins the first two contests, she could become unstoppable, as has every other candidate who won both Iowa and New Hampshire. The biggest Super Tuesday (March 3) state is California, where early voting will begin the day of the Iowa Caucuses. A new, high-quality PPIC poll from the Golden State shows Warren taking a narrow lead there. In the next-largest Super Tuesday state, Texas, Warren moved into second place in a mid-September Quinnipiac poll, in which she trailed Biden by a less-than-formidable ten points. If Team Biden is right and candidates like Bernie Sanders and O’Rourke fade early on, there’s no particular reason Warren might not gain even more ground there. Yes, there are an array of southern states voting on March 3 (Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) where Biden’s strength among white moderates and African-Americans will make him the early favorite. But Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Utah, Vermont, and Warren’s own Massachusetts also vote that day. The latest high-quality national Monmouth poll shows Warren with an identical three-point lead over Biden in both the early and later states

And while Warren does need to expand her support among minority voters (much as Sanders did in 2016), she’s already making progress. The aforementioned Monmouth poll shows her attracting 20 percent of minority voters nationally, eight points behind Biden. Assuming she wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gets the usual short-term “bounce,” such Biden margins could disappear.

None of this peril for Biden takes into account the impact of impeachment proceedings, which is hard to predict. Biden could attract some sympathy from Democratic voters as the victim of Trump’s impeachable efforts to get a foreign government to drop a hammer on him. But sustained attention for his son Hunter’s overseas adventures and sketchy lifestyle may not help, and Warren was the Democratic field’s first impeachment champion.

It’s also not at all certain that Team Biden’s two-candidate prophecy will come true. Yes, there’s some uncertainty about Sanders’s health at the moment, but he shows every sign of recovering and he can boast of impressive third-quarter fundraising (as can Buttigieg and, to a lesser extent, Harris and Yang). And there will be three more candidate debates between now and the Iowa Caucuses, which could upset many applecarts.

Biden’s media whisperers are smart to get a strategic narrative out there to counter the evidence that he’s losing ground to Warren. But he also needs to ensure he doesn’t get embarrassed in Iowa and New Hampshire. However much you spin, the real world still turns according to its own impervious rhythms."

But it was still one punctured by tensions and gaffes like Cuomo’s — namely, on questions of gender identity, as transgender activists of color interrupted the candidates to charge that the event had shut out their voices.

Harris’s line as she stepped onstage drew both praise and accusations of pandering, as she does not usually mention her pronouns at debates or campaign events. Yet, most on social media saved their sharpest criticism for Cuomo, calling his comment tone-deaf and particularly inappropriate for the occasion, which had been organized by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign. Within minutes, members of the media and advocacy groups had blasted Cuomo’s remark online.

It’s commonplace to introduce one’s pronouns in many LGBTQ circles, where appearance, gender identity and expression are far from binary. Yet the phrase is a recent one to enter mainstream television — let alone a political event featuring most of the major Democratic presidential candidates.

That’s perhaps another sign of how LGBTQ issues have entered the mainstream this election cycle in an unprecedented fashion. At the town hall in Los Angeles, attendees in the audience asked nine Democratic candidates questions about HIV and AIDS, mental health care for LGBTQ youth and religious opposition to same-sex marriage.

“For generations, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender Americans have had to live and love in the shadows. We could be arrested, we could be imprisoned, locked up in institutions,” said CNN host Anderson Cooper, an openly gay man, as he introduced the town hall. “The fight for equality is certainly not over.”

Before the audience, all nine candidates promised they would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and would reverse President Trump’s ban on transgender people openly serving in the military.

For one candidate, the night was personal. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came out as gay after serving in Afghanistan, spoke of grappling with his identity as a “civil war.” Asked about the ban on blood donations from men who have sex with men, he said, “My blood’s not welcome in this country. … It’s not based on science; it’s based on prejudice.”

AD

Buttigieg, along with Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), built up to the town hall by releasing their respective agendas on LGBTQ issues. A fourth candidate, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, had published his plans to strengthen rights for gay and transgender people in June.

The evening was also marked by a number of protests from transgender activists in the audience, who interrupted the candidates several times to point to the climbing number of murdered black trans women as well as what they said was a lack of space for their perspectives during the town hall.

“I knew that I was just being brushed off,” Preston told The Washington Post. She added that, especially following comments like Cuomo’s, an interruption from Brown was necessary to bring visibility to black trans women and highlight the oppression they face within the LGBTQ community.

“I understand that sort of frustration of being on the outside, looking into a room that’s claiming to bring you in,” Preston said to The Post. “The same frustration she expressed in the same frustration we have at the community level: We’re always being silenced.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about Medicare-for-all at a town hall last week, then faced inquiries from reporters on impeachment. Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.

“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. “It’s something extra that they have to talk about.”

While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump’s actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake.

“Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,” said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. “I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that’s about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.”

She added, “I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about ‘we’re better than the other guy’ and we don’t lay out a vision.”

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal.

Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump’s conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.

Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said “I’m worried” about the process, fearing it will further divide the country.

But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.

“They’ve got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.

Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. “Impeach his a--!” Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events — and devote space on their social media pages — to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.

But they are taking different tacks.

Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.

“The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,” Warren told reporters after Friday’s town hall. “So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it’s important. The American people are counting on us.”

AD

AD

Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes: tackling corruption.

“For Elizabeth Warren, it’s right in the middle of the bull’s eye,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. “Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn’t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.”

Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed — a remote prospect at the moment — the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they’ve been railing against for months.

AD

Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues.

“The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.

Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.

“Let’s have that trial in the United States Senate,” Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. “I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.

Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden’s son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.

AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.

“It’s very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,” said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

Critics disputed the president’s tweet by pointing to basic definitions of a coup d’etat, a violent illegal overthrow of the government by an opposing group, and impeachment, a legal process laid out in the Constitution. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, even suggested Trump should not be allowed to make such a remark on Twitter, sharing his “COUP” tweet with CEO Jack Dorsey.

“Time to do something about this,” she tweeted to Dorsey.

Gene Healy, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, called Trump’s comparison “dumb and galling.” He pointed out how Vice President Pence, a close ideological ally, would take office if the president were to be impeached, unlike in the illegal overthrow Trump’s tweet evokes.

“What kind of coup would replace Donald Trump with his handpicked, duly elected, loyal-to-a-fault running mate? That’s not a coup,” Healy, also the author of “Indispensable Remedy: The Broad Scope of the Constitution’s Impeachment Power,” told The Washington Post. “So it’s a dumb thing to say, but it’s something that is par for the course in terms of moronic political rhetoric.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The “COUP” tweet follows explosive, and at times threatening, comments Trump has made in attempt to discredit the impeachment inquiry. He has questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for treason, an offense that can be punishable by death. He has ominously alluded to the same punishment while attacking the anonymous whistleblower, whom Trump called “almost a spy.” And he has suggested on Twitter that his impeachment could lead to civil war while quoting Southern Baptist megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress — who had just made a similar argument on “Fox & Friends Weekend.”

Likewise, Trump’s “COUP” tweet came hours after his allies made the same case on Fox News.

AD

“This is not an impeachment. This is a coup d’etat,” Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who led impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton in 1998, said Tuesday on Fox News’s “America’s Newsroom.”

AD

Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, later told Fox Business Network: “This is nothing less than an attempted coup d’etat and end run around the ballot box.""

But Healy said the “coup” argument is old news, a recycled political talking point spewed by both President Richard M. Nixon’s surrogates in the aftermath of Watergate and by Democrats defending Clinton in the ’90s.

“Let’s not pretend Trump is the first to use this stupid comparison,” he said.

AD

During Clinton’s impeachment, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), now chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with investigating Trump, called it a “partisan coup d’etat.” It was a “Republican coup d’etat,” said former congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), and it was “raw, unmasked, unbridled hatred and meanness that drives this impeachment coup d’etat, this unapologetic disregard for the voice of the people,” said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) at the time.

AD

Hillary Clinton, in fact, also said her husband experienced an “attempted Congressional coup d’etat” in her 2003 memoir, “Living History.”

It was already stale by then. For decades after Nixon’s resignation, his closest allies continued to spin the same “coup d’etat” alternative history.

AD

“Having been beaten at the polls in the crushing defeat of the McGovern-Shriver ticket, the left-wingers determined to reverse the election results by forcing Nixon out of the presidency by a process which amounted to a coup d’etat,” Spiro Agnew, Nixon’s vice president who resigned in 1973, wrote in 1980.

Some of Nixon’s most ardent supporters, notably his speechwriter Patrick J. Buchanan, are still making that case today. In June, Buchanan said that if impeachment ever happens to Trump, that would also be an “attempted coup to overthrow a president by the losers of 2016.”

AD

“This COUP business from Trump is the same nonsense that the revisionist Nixon gang pushed for years,” Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said on Twitter, “that Nixon wasn’t really guilty of anything, he was removed from office via a ‘silent coup’ of plotters determined to destroy Nixon’s legacy and policies.”

AD

Healy said Trump notably diverges from past presidents threatened with impeachment by making the “COUP” claim himself rather than leaving it to his surrogates. “He crossed a new rhetorical Rubicon,” Healy said, while noting he finds the president’s “civil war” and “treason” rhetoric considerably more troubling.

It’s also not the first time Trump has claimed to be the victim of a coup. During then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump frequently retweeted or quoted Fox News pundits and Tom Fitton of the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch, who said that the president was targeted in a “Deep State coup effort.”

Making light of a coup for political purposes, critics charged, failed to appreciate the gravity of actual coups such as this one or others around the world.

His victory reverberated well beyond Montgomery as many celebrated the milestone in a city remembered as both the cradle of the Confederacy and the birthplace of the civil rights movement. Montgomery, where about 60 percent of residents are black, was the first capital of the Confederate States of America, becoming a bastion of racial violence and discrimination in the Jim Crow era but also of protests and resistance in the civil rights era.

It’s home to the Montgomery bus boycott against segregation led by Rosa Parks, and it’s home to the Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights led by Martin Luther King Jr. It was in Montgomery where, after the third march in March 1965, King addressed a crowd of 25,000 people on the steps of the Alabama Capitol, famously saying, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

“This is a historic day for our nation,” Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim president and chief executive of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Montgomery, said Tuesday on Twitter. “The election of Steven Reed, the first black mayor of Montgomery, AL, symbolizes the new inclusive & forward thinking South that so many have worked to achieve.”

AD

AD

In an op-ed, the Montgomery Advertiser’s editor described Reed’s win as being “for the thousands of civil rights foot soldiers whose names we rarely say but whose legacy lives forever.”

“Do not underestimate what this means to generations of people who fought hard for the man who looks like Reed to hold the city’s highest office,” executive editor Bro Krift wrote. “Do not depreciate what it means to parents of the youth of this city who look like Reed and who now have a man they can hold up as an example.”

Reed, born and raised in Montgomery, worked various jobs in finance and in the Alabama legislature, as an aide to former lieutenant governor Jim Folsom Jr. (D), before turning to local government in Montgomery. Reed became the youngest and first black probate judge in Montgomery County in 2012 ― and the first probate judge in the state to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2015.

The father of two told the Advertiser earlier this year that he decided to run for mayor after growing dissatisfied with the state of public education and safety, deciding he didn’t need to look to anyone but himself to fix the problems.

“Are you going to sit on the sidelines and complain and throw stuff at the TV about what you could do better or are you going to run to really make a difference?” he told the newspaper.

His rise in politics, in some ways, follows that of his father, himself a political trailblazer and civil rights advocate in Montgomery. Joe L. Reed was elected to the Montgomery City Council in 1975 along with three other African Americans, making them the first black politicians to hold elected office in the city since the Reconstruction era, according to the book “Closed Ranks: The Whitehurst Case in Post-Civil Rights Montgomery.”

AD

AD

The influx of black officeholders that year was largely thanks to Montgomery’s overhaul of its local political system. Before 1975, the mayor and just two at-large commissioners were elected by all residents of Montgomery, rather than having a city council with members belonging to specific districts. Back then, black residents were in the minority, making it difficult for black candidates to win citywide seats, the Advertiser reported.

At the time of Joe Reed’s election, he was already fighting for civil rights. As a student at Alabama State College, he participated in lunch counter sit-ins in 1960, fighting to end segregation in Montgomery. He went on to become a longtime leader in the Alabama Democratic Conference, successfully suing over gerrymandering that diminished the black vote. He served on the city council until 1999 and was known to spar often with Mayor Emory Folmar — described in a 1987 Chicago Tribune dispatch as “the most popular and efficient mayor in Montgomery’s history and reviled as its most racist and divisive.” Announcing his candidacy for reelection that year, he proclaimed race a “dead issue.”

Folmar, the longest-serving Montgomery mayor with a 22-year tenure, initially took office in 1977 in the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of a fleeing, unarmed black man, Bernard Whitehurst, who was mistaken for a robbery suspect — a case that would affect the black community’s relationship with police for years to come. “Rather than take steps to identify and correct the problem, it seems that Folmar’s actions made things worse,” the Journal of the Southern Regional Council observed in 1983.

AD

AD

Since Folmar’s exit from office in 1999, only two other mayors have been elected. The most recent, Mayor Todd Strange, decided not to seek reelection this year after a decade in office. Ten of the 12 candidates running to replace him are black.

Steven Reed’s platform centered on investing in universal prekindergarten, eliminating food deserts and beefing up the Montgomery police force, which most candidates argued was understaffed.

On Tuesday night, Reed did not address his status as the city’s first black mayor but acknowledged its significance hours before the numbers were finally tallied, speaking to the Advertiser.

“I take that with a great deal of humility and a great deal of responsibility, what that means to so many people who have been a part of Montgomery who have lived here and left here because of the racial terror they underwent and moved far, far away,” Reed said. “And what it means to the people who stayed here and continue to chip away and who definitely want to see someone in this position that looks like them. I think I had to kind of take a step back. … It’s way bigger than just Steven Reed.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who endorsed Reed for mayor, congratulated him on Twitter “on making history in Montgomery tonight.""

“The birthplace of the civil rights movement has a new era of leadership for the first time in its 200-year history,” she wrote. “Montgomery is in good hands.”

Reed was not the only first black mayor elected in Alabama on Tuesday. In Talladega, Ala., a city of about 15,000 and home to a popular NASCAR racetrack, voters also elected their first black mayor, Timothy Ragland. The 28-year-old law clerk defeated the incumbent in a tight race, the Daily Home reported.

Talladega was incorporated in 1835.

Aimee Stephens’s boss at Harris Funeral Homes called himself “old fashioned.” He required women employees to wear skirts and men to wear dark suits, because he believed that “a male should look like a … man and a woman should look like a woman.” Doing otherwise would violate “God’s commands.” When he fired Stephens after she’d worked there for almost six years, she argues, it was because she “departed from its owner’s sex stereotypes about how men and women should appear, behave, and identify.”

And yet this week, in a moment of terrifying historical weight, attorneys for the funeral home are asking the Supreme Court to say that Aimee Stephens wasn’t discriminated against on the basis of her sex — which is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — because she is transgender. Weeks after Stephens sent a letter to her employer saying she had “decided to become the person that my mind already is” and would soon start wearing the uniform marked female, the funeral-home owner fired her. “Because he was no longer going to represent himself as a man,” her boss would explain, refusing to refer to Stephens by female pronouns. “He wanted to dress like a woman.”

In a brief written by the Christian-right legal-advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, Harris Funeral Homes claims that Stephens isn’t covered by civil-rights law because they “would have responded to a female employee who insisted on dressing as a man while working with grieving families the same way it responded to Stephens.”

Tuesday’s oral argument is likely to be the first time the word transgender has been spoken before the mahogany bench, Chase Strangio, one of Stephens’s attorneys at the ACLU, recently wrote, “and when the justices look out from the bench and see my co-counsel and me at counsel table, it may be the first time they have looked at transgender attorneys defending our own existence.” The justices are being asked not only to consider the case of Stephens and the separate cases of two gay men who say they were fired for their sexual orientation, but more broadly to answer the question of whether a person can be fired for being the wrong kind of woman or man.

That’s already supposed to be illegal. “In order to excise LGBT people from the protection of civil-rights law, the Trump administration is asking them to roll back sex-discrimination law for everyone,” Strangio told me in an interview. If the court accepts their arguments, Strangio said, “the enforcement of sex stereotypes in the workplace is lawful as long as it is complementary.” The government, in this view, can police the boundaries of gender as long as it does so for everyone; woe betide the cisgender woman at Harris Funeral Homes whose conduct is unbecoming to a lady.

It’s fair to say that legislators in 1964 probably weren’t contemplating cases like these. (According to Gillian Thomas’s Because of Sex, an account of the gender provision of the Civil Rights Act, they were mainly thinking about white supremacy, openly worrying that banning only racial discrimination would give black women more rights than white ones.) But for decades, the highest court has repeatedly allowed that federal ban on gender discrimination to be interpreted more expansively than the most literal meaning at that particular moment. The justices grasped over the years that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination against women, and in 1989, the court agreed that Title VII also protected a cisgender woman who had been fired from Price Waterhouse because she didn’t dress and act as women were expected to. The point of the law, a plurality wrote, was “to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.” In 1998, no less of a conservative darling than Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority that men who were sexually harassed by men also were covered by the law, because while it was “assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with,” the law could cover “reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.”

As “reasonably comparable evils” go, a transgender woman and two gay men’s being fired for their gender identity and sexual orientation is hardly a stretch. The broader principle that the government cannot tell Americans how to be a man and how to be a woman underpinned the 1970s constitutional advocacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who will sit on the other side of the bench Tuesday; that work already helped bolster arguments for marriage equality.

But Stephens’s opponents purport to be the true feminists. The attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice, who filed a brief supporting the funeral home, claim that making it illegal to fire Aimee Stephens would “reduce bodily-privacy protections for everyone, and erode equal opportunities for women and girls.” They raise the fearmongering specter of “overnight facilities, showers, restrooms, and locker rooms.” Pseudo-feminist Astroturf groups like the Independent Women’s Forum have claimed that ruling for Stephens would ultimately “reduce the number of athletic opportunities for biological women and girls.” (Several legitimate feminist groups, like the National Women’s Law Center and a coalition of anti-violence groups, have filed on behalf of Stephens and the other plaintiffs.) Something called the Women’s Liberation Front, which boasts of “over 500 members,” accuses Stephens of having “bootstrapped” existing law to “revolutionize the legal meaning of ‘male’ and ‘female.’”

So-called bootstrapping has, in fact, been the history of how the creaky structures of the law have gradually made room for people historically left out of it. Women would still be lesser creatures under the constitution if Ginsburg hadn’t bootstrapped onto the 14th Amendment, which was written to protect the formerly enslaved. Movements are built on each other, in part out of a recognition of a common purpose (or, at least, a common adversary); the law has often followed, if imperfectly. Had the law not had room to grow, women still could be lawfully fired for being perceived as too aggressive, and all of the oppressions uncovered by Me Too might still be perfectly legal. The women who now believe they can shut the door after themselves may soon find themselves on the wrong side of it."

The companies are trying to maintain a neutral stance, even if that draws the ire of politicians as divergent as the president and those trying to impeach him. Behind the scenes, though, they are spending millions on lobbying in hopes of warding off breakups or intrusive regulation.

Not that there is any danger of either happening any time soon, especially with an ongoing impeachment probe. Still, talking up Big Tech’s problems has proven to be popular political rhetoric.

When it comes to policing content, social media services are “caught between a rock and a hard place,” said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University political scientist who studies social media and its effects on political opinion.

Blocking or suspending accounts for hate speech can prompt complaints of political bias or censorship, but a hands-off approach may be viewed as a free pass to politicians like Trump.

AD

“Anything they do is going to attract criticism,” Guess said. “That, of course, makes them a target.”

Beyond discourse and privacy, antitrust concerns have emerged as a major concern for lawmakers and candidates. This wasn’t the case in 2016, when grumbling about the outsized power of tech was largely confined to activists and those on the most liberal end of the spectrum.

Leading the pack has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies. She garnered immediate support, even from rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time. Cruz said “she’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.”

AD

Since then, calling out the tech behemoths and other big corporations has been a pillar of Warren’s presidential campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders, another leading Democratic candidate, has also said breaking up Amazon, Google and Apple is “something we should definitely take a look at.”

AD

Still, while there have been congressional hearings, investigations and fines, including a record $5 billion against Facebook, little has changed for Big Tech.

A Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass legislation that seems too anti-business. That includes breaking up tech companies seen as too monopolistic. The same likely goes for any privacy law that restricts companies’ ability to target ads to their liking.

AD

While the two parties agree that Big Tech has problems, they often differ on what those problems are — and how to fix them. You won’t find many Democrats complaining about tech’s perceived conservative bias, for instance. Nor will you find many conservatives complaining of algorithmic bias against people of color.

Trump has been uneven in his criticisms. Amazon has been a frequent target, though that is due in part to CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post. He’s met with Zuckerberg privately, but he’s also tweeted that “Facebook was always anti-Trump” and accused it of colluding with the news media against him.

AD

Amid all this, at least in public, the companies have mostly kept a low profile. But there are occasional glimpses of behind-the-scenes activity. Leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July captured Zuckerberg acknowledging that if “someone like” Warren is elected, he expects Facebook to fight back — and prevail — against efforts to break it up in court. But he added: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah.”

AD

Amazon, by contrast, briefly tried to debate the candidates on Twitter.

In April, after Warren complained that Amazon and other big tech companies have “too much power,” the company responded by pointing the finger at its main rival: “Walmart is much larger; Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail.”

When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a TV interview in June that Amazon pays workers “starvation wages,” the company tweeted that she “is just wrong.”

AD

And Amazon gave former Vice President Joe Biden a corporate tax lesson after he tweeted that it shouldn’t be paying a “lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.”

“We pay every penny we owe,” Amazon tweeted back. “Congress designed tax laws to encourage companies to reinvest in the American economy. We have.”

AD

This was in June. Amazon seems to have backed off since.

Expect the political pushback to continue, from both parties, said Joshua Tucker, co-director of New York University’s Social Media and Political Participation Lab.

“It’s a bipartisan issue,” he said. “But the right and the left are criticizing it for different reasons.”

At a Senate hearing last May, Kamala Harris asked Attorney General William Barr, “Has the president or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?” Barr declined to answer. It is fairly clear why. He has apparently been directing the probe his boss, President Trump, has been demanding for years: one designed to show that the FBI investigation into Trump’s secretive and compromising relations with Russia was itself a crime.

Several newspaper reports have turned up details of Barr’s involvement. He has met with officials in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy. In theory, there’s nothing wrong with cross-checking the FBI’s work to make sure it handled its investigation of Trump correctly. But everything about this investigation suggests Barr is carrying out a political vendetta at Trump’s orders to intimidate bureaucrats who would defy the authoritarian and lawless president.

Barr has been prejudging the Mueller investigation in public since before Trump appointed him. In 2017, he said Mueller’s investigation of obstruction of justice risked “taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president.” Last April, he accused the FBI of “spying” on Trump, again opining without evidence that the bureau had treated the president very unfairly. (“I think there was a failure among a group of leaders [at the FBI] at the upper echelon.”)

He has repeatedly cast the FBI investigation as a coup attempt. “Republics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences, and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state,” he said in one especially wild interview. “And you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they’re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.” This is exactly Trump’s “Deep State” theory, albeit employing more multisyllabic terms: An evil cabal of bureaucrats has decided to overturn the will of the people by trying to overturn the 2016 election.

Another sign is that Trump’s loyalists have expressed almost uncontainable excitement about Barr’s work. In April, Trump excitedly told Sean Hannity that Barr was investigating “big” and “incredible” evidence that Ukraine had secretly colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign to plant evidence against Trump.

The right-wing legal community has been vibrating with excitement at what Barr is producing. Conservative columnist and movement apparatchik Hugh Hewitt gleefully predicts Barr will give “shock therapy” to Democrats. “A Justice Department inspector-general report into surveillance of American citizens based on the Steele dossier is coming,” he notes. “If indictments are warranted, U.S. Attorney John Durham will be bringing them. And a deep dive into Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma and its well-connected board member named Biden, is imminent.” Former George W. Bush attorney general Michael Mukasey, after, of course, insisting in the Wall Street Journal editorial page on Trump’s innocence, pivots to Barr’s counter-investigation. Mukasey lets on that one of Barr’s investigators will soon “determine whether highly specific criminal laws were violated, and if so by whom” — i.e., the perpetrators are not Trump or his loyalists but the people who investigated him. The fact that Republicans have such specific and wildly positive expectations for Barr’s probe is a foreboding sign.

Barr’s counter-investigation is not the same thing as Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Biden. It is not improper on its face; in theory, Barr might be double-checking everything in a completely aboveboard fashion. But there is little reason to believe Barr is acting fairly at all and a great deal of reason to suspect he is carrying out his duties as hatchet man for his authoritarian boss."

Harris’ campaign is very good at organizing demonstrations of support on behalf of “Kamala for the People.” Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke have shown signs of developing a bit of a cult of personality among excited followers. Joe Biden’s adept at getting into the swing of things at African-American churches, and could probably turn a Knights of Columbus Bingo Night into something special.

But for a distinctly wild and entirely spontaneous political crowd, it’s hard to beat Andrew Yang and his Gang, as they showed early this week in the City of the Angels. The Los Angeles Times had the story:

The underdog Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang walked onstage at MacArthur Park on Monday night with the swagger of a competitor who’s already won, complete with a pyrotechnic display and the 1990s R&B classic “Return of the Mack” playing on the speaker system….

Yang’s showmanship, humorously math-based approach to solving America’s problems and his love of f-bombs have won him a diverse and ear-splitting following that was on full display at his Los Angeles rally.

Members of the “Yang Gang” and the Yang-curious packed the lawn in front of the amphitheater where the candidate spoke, many hoisting signs with single words on them that anywhere else wouldn’t seem to go together: Some just said “Math.” Others said “Humanity.”

The atmosphere was not, shall we say, that of an old-school political rally featuring corny patriotic songs or venerable protests songs–or the refashioned Top 40 music that boomer pols from Bill Clinton (“Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow”) to Donald Trump (“You Can’t Always Get What You Want”) always favored:

This wasn’t a typical campaign rally. It was more like a revival set to hip-hop, with one-liners that much of the crowd knew by heart.

Any time Yang said the word “math,” the crowd chanted “Math!” “Math!” “Math!” as part of the nerdy-cool theater of his campaign events. Several people brought signs featuring a thousand-dollar bill with Yang’s face on it.

That would be an allusion to Yang’s signature policy initiative, a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month designed to offset mass unemployment caused by intensified automation. But increasingly the 44-year-old entrepreneur’s untraditional style is getting as much attention as his substance:

“He represents something that’s beyond politics,” said Lee-kai Wong, 34, a genetics lab worker at UCLA. “The way he talks about the country — it’s a message of healing. I think we need a little more mercy and forgiveness.”

Yang’s campaign is still in the single digits in polling, but his support and the donations that go along with it have gotten him onto the stage of every Democratic debate so far — beating out political veterans and more traditional candidates.

Tony Moreno, 52, a professional driver from Ontario, said Yang “crosses every color line there is” culturally and politically.

As I can testify upon abundantly hearing from the Yang Gang after writing that he had no plausible path to the nomination, the Gang is very outspoken on social media. They pretty clearly view their candidate as sui generis and the fomenter of a potential political revolution. Plus they believe deeply in his coolness:

The crowd at MacArthur Park kept urging Yang to body-surf over his amassed supporters, but he’s already riding a wave.

He’s raising money and performing in polls well enough, it seems, to stay on the debate stage with the more traditional candidates at least through November, at which point a lot of his rivals may drop out. So keep an eye on Yang and the Gang. However little media coverage they receive, they are pretty good at gaining attention."

Despite all the attention that has been given to the competition (mostly between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) for the love and support of progressive activists during the early stages of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, there’s an arguably even more important struggle underway for labor movement backing. Yes, union ranks have been steadily diminished in recent decades, and unions have been subjected to a sustained and often successful campaign of demonization by employees, shadowy dark money groups, conservative ideologues and black-robed judicial cheerleaders for corporations. But as my colleague Sarah Jones has pointed out, labor is feeling its oats in 2020:

[L]abor is seizing its moment. In a Wednesday morning speech in Milwaukee, the president of the Service Employees International Union outlined sweeping expectations for candidates who want the union’s endorsement. Mary Kay Henry praised Democrats for releasing policy plans to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, but made it clear that those plans are an inadequate substitute for releasing detailed, union-specific proposals. “The wealthy will find a way to protect their wealth, often at any cost. That’s why we need to put working people in charge. Because when workers organize, we can make bigger change, and we can make it stick,” Henry told assembled workers.

She then called for remedies that would increase union power and raise the nation’s rates of union membership. SEIU, she said, expects candidate proposals to meet four basic standards. They should prioritize union membership as a way to reduce economic inequality, and call for sectoral bargaining, where workers employed by different companies in the same industry could bargain collectively for a universal contract. They should also urge states to treat federal labor law as a floor, and not a ceiling, for labor rights, and ensure that federal workers and contractors make at least $15 an hour and have a chance to form a union if they choose. “If candidates can’t commit to these four things, they can’t count on our support,” she said, “and let’s face it, these candidates need our support.”

It’s probably no coincidence that fast-rising candidate Elizabeth Warren released her latest “plan” focused on labor rights the day before SEIU’s pre-endorsement presidential forum. And Vox’s Alexia Fernandez Campbell adjudges it as the “most ambitious” of the campaign so far. It’s certainly the longest, weighing in at 14 pages, and clearly meeting all of SEIU’s criteria. Bernie Sanders anticipated Warren’s action in August with his own “Workplace Democracy Plan.” As Campbell says, though, Warren’s is more detail-oriented:

In many ways, Warren’s ideas mirror some of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s proposals, like making it easier for workers to go on strike and letting unions bargain on behalf of an entire industry. But Warren also focuses on the minutiae — the little tweaks and changes that could make a real difference for working Americans.

About a month ago Campbell also characterized the leading candidates as a whole as falling into two groups:

Reading the labor platforms for each of the 10 candidates who qualified for the third Democratic primary debate next week, two groups emerged: the labor reformers and the labor supporters. Most of the frontrunners fall into the first category — Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, and Sanders have all put out astonishingly detailed proposals that would shift the balance of power from businesses to workers. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang are in the second group. They seem to see themselves more as allies to workers and labor unions than true change-makers.

More recently, veteran labor reporter Steven Greenhouse gave candidates letter grades for their labor proposals, with Sanders and Warren earning an A; Pete Buttigieg an A-minus; Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, and Beto O’Rourke a B; Amy Klobuchar a B-minus; and Andrew Yang a C+. (To provide context, Greenhouse awarded Donald Trump an F-plus). It’s interesting that in almost all assessments of the field, Warren rated well even before she issued her “plan” because of deep appreciation for her trade policy proposals, which some union officials told Greenhouse were “by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker.” She had also made a mark earlier with her Accountable Capitalism Act, guaranteeing workers 40 percent of corporate board positions, and her early support for California’s new legislation restoring wage, benefit, and union rights to “gig economy” workers.

Whatever endorsements individual unions make (and most are being cautious this year after too many piled onto the Hillary Clinton bandwagon early in the 2016 cycle), their memberships have a host of concerns just like any other voters, including health care (e.g., Medicare for All, which some fervently embrace while others fear as disruptive of generous health plans won at the bargaining table), specific industry concerns related to energy and the environment, women’s and minority rights, and of course electability. Any of the Democrats would be considered far superior to Trump and the party he leads. It’s notable that the pol most often singled out as representing the GOP’s bright and diverse post-Trump future, Nikki Haley, once told corporate investors they weren’t welcome in South Carolina if they brought along “union jobs.” Now more than ever, presidential general elections are a holy war for the labor movement, and its organizational muscle and enthusiasm will be valued assets for the eventual Democratic nominee."

Maybe it’s a coincidence, but just as the Democratic presidential nominating contest gets close to its voting phase, we are seeing a revival of shadowy threats of new “centrist outsider” candidacies. One is very familiar, per CNBC:

Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all.

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private.

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Another comes from the opposite coast, per the Washington Post:

Bob Iger keeps saying he’s not interested in running for president. At least, not anymore.

But there’s still a small but influential push in Hollywood to get the Disney CEO to change his mind, according to two entertainment executives.

They see him as a successful — and likable — businessman who could actually take on President Trump. And be a more appealing alternative than some of the far-left populists now dominating the Democratic primary — especially as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), starts leading in some polls.

Leading this “push,” says the Post, is none other than Oprah Winfrey, herself once the object of Candidate of National Salvation talk. And here’s the kernel of sentiment that seems to be driving both the Bloomberg and Iger speculation:

“Democrats are a train wreck,” the [senior television] executive said. “The second Warren goes up in the polls — no one in corporate America will vote for her.”

And when you’ve lost “corporate America,” you’ve lost America, right?

You don’t have to have insider access or psychic abilities to suspect that beneath all the expressed boardroom fear of Warren losing to Trump is the deeper fear of Warren beating Trump and implementing her agenda. A wealth tax, aggressive antitrust enforcement, worker representation on corporate boards, and far more … Four more years of Trump may be preferable to some of these alleged Trump-haters. What is unclear is whether the new-candidate talk is legitimate, or simply an indirect way for those who oppose Elizabeth Warren to buck up Biden before it’s too late.

One thing is clear, though: It really is too late for a new candidate, however well financed, to jump into the Democratic nomination fight. Tom Steyer is as rich as any of these people, and waited until July of 2019 to launch his own candidacy. As his performance at the October 15 debate showed after he spent $47 million to buy his way onto the stage, the rich outsider “lane” in the 2020 Democratic primaries is narrow, already filled, and going nowhere. Unless Joe Biden drops out of the race tomorrow, and somehow Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar or Kamala Harris doesn’t instantly soak up his support, Bob Iger is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee, period. So the better way to understand this talk is as a trial balloon for an independent general-election candidacy of the sort that Bloomberg contemplated in 2016 and Howard Schultz considered earlier this year.

With enough money and enough overheated talk about saving America from the Scylla of Trumpism and the Charybdis of socialism, there’s plenty of time for a general-election indie bid to develop. Perhaps it can even become part of some new international centrist push, with Trump and Boris Johnson in one unacceptable camp and Warren and Jeremy Corbyn in the other.

If this kind of buzz does develop, it could help Biden (or whoever the centrist Democratic champion turns out to be) by reviving Democrat terror about third- or fourth-party threats to what is otherwise an invincible advantage over Trump, reflecting one of the theories about how Hillary Clinton managed to lose in 2016. As fate would have it, HRC herself is fanning those very flames, reports Axios:

Hillary Clinton said on David Plouffe’s podcast “Campaign HQ” this week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is Russia’s “favorite” 2020 candidate and said the country could be “grooming” her to become a third-party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She’s the favorite of the Russians …”

She told Plouffe that Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee for president in 2012 and 2016, is a “Russian asset — I mean, totally.”

Yikes. Let’s hope for Clinton’s sake that Stein is enough of a public figure to keep her from successfully suing HRC for slander. But conspiracy theories aside, an indie or third-party candidacy that lifts an unpopular Trump to the presidency once again is a specter that will haunt Democrats all the way until November of 2020. The immediate question is whether that nightmare will have a tangible effect on their own choice of candidates beginning in Iowa in early February."

This afternoon, right-wing hucksters Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman held another press conference. Wohl and Burkman frequently and lazily concoct political scandals out of thin air and then fail to back them up. They are regarded, far and wide, as a joke. They tried unsuccessfully to Me Too Robert Mueller. Earlier this month, they leveled allegations that Elizabeth Warren was having an affair with a much younger former Marine. Today, they alleged that Senator Ted Cruz was a swinger.

You should not care about this pair. I need to be very clear on that. They are big ol’ dummies and every blog post about them (including this one) is giving them oxygen.

That being said, their audio-visual setup is wild. I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s so funny. It tickles me. Every time they hold one of these dumb press conferences in Burkman’s driveway, I see this ramshackle AV setup and laugh. It’s baffling. It keeps me up at night. I have an idiot disease and the cause is this collection of furniture and appliances.

Two private security guards are here and there is a TV that says “Press Conference.”

Generally, each presser has the same setup, as seen in the tweet above from this past May. All of it has the vibe of when you gave your parents a “Why I Should Be Allowed to Have a Nintendo” presentation in third grade.

At the top of the 12 steps leading up to Burkman’s stoop is a lectern. Below that, at a slight jag in the staircase, is a side table with a flat-screen TV on top of it. There is also a sound system with some heavy-duty speakers connected to a mic at the lectern.

God, all of it makes me laugh. It sends me into a downward spiral whenever I see it. This setup exists in the space between impromptu and rehearsed. The tech set reflects the people they are: amateurs cosplaying as pros. They wear suits to their own press conferences, where they haul a table and a TV out from the living room and plop it on the porch. But they are also so committed to this bit that they have a robust speaker setup for their dozen or so attendees. It’s all incongruous.

Their security guard just wears one AirPod? Who could he possibly be talking to? He’s the only guard.

It’s not like they don’t have money. The alleged victims they pull out of the woodwork to smear others are often paid. A man that the pair recruited to level bogus claims against Kamala Harris said he was hired off of a Craigslist ad seeking “a male actor in their early 20’s to early 30’s for basic performance art acting” and promising $250 an hour, according to the Daily Beast.

Gentleman, you could put that money toward better equipment, maybe an outdoor projection system. You do not have to keep hauling furniture that clearly is from Burkman’s living room out to the driveway. That table has a glass top; if you slip while carrying it down the steps, you could be in real trouble.

It is so funny to me that there’s a lectern. Why is there a lectern? The pair hosts these press conferences with enough frequency that I have to assume they own a lectern. That’s funny to me; keeping a lectern on hand just in case you need to give a press conference about horny politicians. “Jacob, my man, we gotta break out the lectern.”

Iconic. There are wires everywhere. Guys, what are you doing? Clean up these cables. They’re just sitting there in a tangled nest on the steps. I live in a crappy, tiny apartment and even I keep my AV cables tucked out of site. Have some self-respect. Also, someone could trip. Again, I’d like to stress the glass table.

Oh, another question I just thought of. Why is the TV in front of the podium? That seems like an oversight. They can’t see the TV. How are they going to know what’s on the TV?

I love the optics of it. I am enraptured by the “outdoor community playhouse production” aesthetic. I hate these hucksters, but you gotta hand it to them: They’re working with what they’ve got (which is one full-size lectern, a midsize flat-screen TV, a tasteful side table, two pro-grade speakers, and a couple of semi-functional brains)."

Mayor Pete Buttigieg debuted a new look at Tuesday’s primary debate: that of a moderate pugilist, a combative scold whose engagement with his opponents’ ideas ranged from derisive to dismissive. Adopting a tone that verged on snide, he assailed several of the more left-leaning candidates onstage. Beto O’Rourke’s mandatory assault-rifle buybacks proposal became a “shiny object” from a man Buttigieg “[didn’t] need lessons from … on courage, political or otherwise”; the details of Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan, marked by her insistence on discussing its funding in terms of costs rather than taxes, were obscured by her evasive responses to “a yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer” — behavior, the mayor said, that encapsulates “why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.”

As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti wrote, it’s all part of a strategy to position Buttigieg to benefit if Joe Biden falters. With Warren and Bernie Sanders staking out the primary’s leftward flank, the mayor sees his best hope for securing the nomination — or at least catapulting himself into a higher polling tier — in drawing contrasts with them and projecting himself as a younger, more lucid, and less baggage-laden competitor for supporters of the former vice-president: liberal centrists and older black voters. It’s a risky gambit for two reasons. First, Buttigieg’s appeal derives largely from his mild-mannered charm and self-branding as an above-the-fray consensus-builder — both of which were undermined by his antagonistic behavior on Tuesday. But more crucially, it’s imperiled by his knack for thwarting his own efforts to build relationships with black voters, whose support he’ll need if he’s to seriously challenge Biden, Warren, Sanders, or even Kamala Harris.

The latest example occurred on Friday, when the Associated Press reported that the mayor was scheduled to attend a fundraiser co-hosted by Steve Patton. As head of Chicago’s law department under former mayor Rahm Emanuel, Patton was a key figure in the administration’s efforts to hide dashcam footage of Laquan McDonald’s killing from the public. The black 17-year-old was shot 16 times in 2014 by then–police officer Jason Van Dyke, who was later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison. Officers at the scene initially lied, saying that McDonald had lunged toward them with a knife. The Emanuel administration pushed to hide video that disputed their account until after the mayor won reelection — a decision made under Patton’s advisement. When reporters this week drew attention to Patton’s role in the cover-up, and that he’d made a max donation of $5,600 to Buttigieg’s campaign, Buttigieg and his staffers declined to comment, according to the AP. But as public pressure mounted on Friday morning, they abruptly removed Patton as a co-host and refunded his money. “Transparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution,” Chris Meagher, the Buttigieg campaign’s communications director, told Axios. “We are returning the money he contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.”

Buttigieg has criticized promises made by the Warren and Sanders campaigns to refuse high-dollar donations from corporate PACs and lobbyists. “My competitors can go with whatever strategy they like … we’re not going to beat [Trump] with pocket change,” he said earlier this week. But ongoing developments showcase the irony of this stance: Buttigieg has attracted less money in donations than either of them, and, until public pressure forced his hand, one of his donors was a central figure in a police shooting cover-up. All of which complicates a campaign that’s already weathered its share of racial controversy, particularly the questions surrounding Buttigieg’s firing of South Bend’s black police chief and the police shooting death of Eric Logan over the summer — both of which have drawn fiery criticism from black locals. The mayor’s efforts to make nice have come off, to some of them, as superficial and unconvincing. “You running for president and you expect black people to vote for you?” one woman asked as he addressed a march protesting Logan’s death in June. “I’m not asking for your vote,” Buttigieg replied. “You ain’t gonna get it either,” the woman said.

By several accounts, Buttigieg’s once-dismal support numbers among black voters in key primary states, most notably South Carolina, are trending upward, and his black outreach team insists that name recognition is his main barrier to improving them exponentially. But the abrupt tonal shifts displayed during Tuesday’s debate and his ill-advised association with Steve Patton — paired with his initial decision not to comment when Patton’s role in the Laquan McDonald case was brought to his attention, and only parting ways with him once public pressure made their relationship untenable — risk creating even more barriers to his efforts to amass black support than his troubles in South Bend had already created. Perhaps more troubling, his newly combative attitude and derision toward progressive positions for which he once professed unequivocal support suggest the kind of boring careerism that fuels the very problems on Capitol Hill that he claims to want to solve. Last-minute efforts to mend the rifts he’s caused with black voters are unlikely to save his campaign. But they do illustrate why his path into Biden supporters’ hearts is rockier than he might have estimated."

Those examples, both of which ended with the commander in chief beating the charges against him and serving out his full term, on first blush do appear to bolster that case.

Andrew Johnson’s experience in particular astounds to this day. After that president’s egregious behavior and manifest unfitness for office got him impeached by the Republican-dominated House in 1868, the Senate failed to remove him from office — by one vote. That result came despite the GOP holding a greater-than-two-thirds majority in the Senate.

The wrong lesson, however, can be taken from Johnson’s nonconviction. Senators allowed the president to remain in place partly because they suspected the law that the president had violated to prompt his impeachment, the Tenure of Office Act, itself stood on particularly shaky ground. (It was, in fact, later ruled unconstitutional.) Other articles of impeachment against Johnson included “crimes” like speaking ill of Congress in public — which may very well have contravened a lingering norm from the early days of the republic but fell very well short of warranting immediate ejection from the presidency.

It’s hard to imagine Trump’s forthcoming impeachment resting on such weak foundations. Most likely, articles of impeachment against him will point to core abuses of power, obstruction of justice and failure to comply with lawful congressional subpoenas — and that’s if the House only chooses to highlight misdeeds related to the Ukraine debacle.

AD

AD

What about the most recent failed conviction of an impeached chief executive? After Bill Clinton’s articles of impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice passed the House in 1999, GOP senators couldn’t muster even a majority vote to convict him on either article, much less the two-thirds needed to kick him out of the White House.

But it’s worth recalling that Clinton’s acquittal came largely because his violations of law were intended to cover up a personal affair, not a matter of state, and were not seen as a persistent pattern of inherent unfitness. The situation now is quite different. Trump’s actions on the Ukraine scandal alone implicate the constitutional fabric itself, and they build on inappropriate activities described in detail in the scathing Mueller report. This all puts senators tasked with judging Trump in a different place than those who judged Clinton.

The Senate-will-never-convict club can discount this history, pointing instead to congressional Republicans’ sycophancy during the past two years, and credibly say, “GOP senators are in lock-step with the president and will rally around their fellow Republican.” And indeed, getting 20 out of 53 Republican senators to agree to boot him from office won’t be easy under any circumstances.

AD

AD

Trump, however, is far from an institutional Republican. He had never run for office as a Republican before the 2016 presidential election. From the 1980s into the Obama years, he donated more to Democratic candidates than to Republican ones. As late as 2004, he said he identified more as a Democrat than as a Republican.

His party credentials contrast sharply with the most recent nearly impeached Republican president, Richard M. Nixon. By the time the Judiciary Committee voted on articles of impeachment against Nixon, he had been a steady partisan for almost 30 years: a Republican representative and senator from California from 1947 until 1953, vice president of the United States for eight years under Dwight D. Eisenhower, the party’s standard-bearer in the 1960 presidential election, Republican candidate in the 1962 California gubernatorial race and president since 1969.

So when Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) in early August 1974 led a GOP triumvirate to the White House to tell Nixon that he’d lost the congressional support necessary to hold on to the presidency — telling him, “There’s not more than 15 senators for you” — he was addressing the man who many Republicans saw as the face of the party.

AD

AD

Not so now. While the GOP has largely embraced Trump’s political program even where it breaks with long-standing party orthodoxy, he has earned little enduring loyalty within the establishment. Republican senators remain loathe to break openly with the president, but former senator Jeff Flake last month candidly assessed that 35 of his former GOP colleagues would vote to remove Trump from office if the poll were taken in private. “Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons,” Flake also said, “realizes that there’s not a lot of love for the president.”

Flake’s point has limited utility; a Senate trial of Trump would not end, of course, with a private vote. His observation nevertheless reveals a core truth: Republican support for Trump is highly instrumental, not fundamental. If the president’s overall approval rating sat above 60 percent (as Bill Clinton’s did during his impeachment trial), or if the majority of the American people opposed impeachment and removal as they did then, or even only if support among Republicans for Trump’s impeachment and removal remained in the single digits, fear of Trump’s tweets would probably keep GOP senators in line.

Polls now tell a different story. Trump’s aggregated approval rating has never escaped the 35 to 45 percent band, keeping it stunningly short of Clinton’s overall numbers. Plus, a new Fox News poll shows 51 percent of respondents support impeaching and removing Trump. And a Washington Post-Schar School poll reveals that 18 percent of Republicans support his impeachment and removal.

In this environment, even the small dose of political courage we’ve seen this week from Republicans on Capitol Hill matters. On the Ukraine affair, at least two GOP senators — Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) — publicly expressed concern about the president’s actions. Before Trump’s angry tweets responding to Romney could become a headline story, the president’s decision to expose Kurds in northern Syria to Turkish attacks spurred much wider criticism from Republican senators, including firm Trump ally Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). Talk is cheap, yes. But coming on the heels of so many instances of GOP senators’ silence in the wake of Trump’s controversies, one can forgive The Post’s Shane Harris for calling it a “Republican rebellion.” Most importantly, the president uncharacteristically refrained from lashing out at those who disagreed with him.

Political momentum has odd properties. When tides turn, they often turn quickly and harshly. While the basic math still points to a Senate acquittal, this week nevertheless brings to mind Winston Churchill’s words after the British victory at El Alamein in 1942: “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”

Although it’s just one survey, the findings suggest that Warren’s growing popularity, evident in other polls, comes from her increasing appeal beyond the party’s left wing. And with Warren also establishing herself as the second choice for many Democrats currently backing other candidates, she may be well-positioned to pick up more support as the field thins.

The GW Politics Poll is a joint venture of George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs, Department of Political Science, and Graduate School of Political Management. The survey, conducted by YouGov and including interviews with 600 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, went into the field Sept. 26, two days after House Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry, and was completed Sept. 30. As a result, respondents were probably aware of Biden’s entanglement in the Trump-Ukraine drama but didn’t know about Sanders’s heart attack, which was revealed after the poll ended.

Warren appears to be broadening her appeal

Warren has throughout the campaign had her strongest support from the most liberal Democrats. And, not surprisingly, 4 in 10 voters who call themselves “very liberal” say they would vote for her. But the survey confirms she is now winning over other voters. Among Democrats who call themselves simply “liberal,” she is polling at 33 percent, 12 points ahead of Sanders and 17 points better than Biden.

AD

AD

Biden, meanwhile, continues to hold a lead among moderate and conservative Democrats, with 28 percent. But in what may be a sign of concern, he is polling just 12 points better among those voters than both Warren and Sanders.

Warren’s improvement among less liberal Democrats also means she’s doing slightly better with black voters, who are more ideologically conservative than whites. Long mired in single digits, Warren is at 13 percent among black voters (and Sanders at 12) in the GW Politics Poll, though she still trails Biden at 35 percent by a significant margin.

Warren’s image is also evolving. Respondents were asked whether they prefer elected officials who “make compromises with people they disagree with” or those who “stick to their positions.” Despite Warren’s reputation as a proponent of “uncompromising liberalism,” 34 percent of Democrats who said they prefer compromise are backing her. Among those who prefer politicians to stick to their positions, Sanders is the top choice (26 percent), with Biden at 20 percent and Warren at 18.

Warren is the prevailing second choice

Perhaps the poll’s most bullish finding on Warren comes from asking respondents whom they would support if their favored candidate dropped out or they had to choose someone else. Warren is the second choice of 34 percent of voters who support another candidate. That includes 45 percent of Biden voters and 31 percent of Sanders voters.

On the other hand, the numbers don’t look as good for Sanders and Biden. Sanders is the second choice of just 21 percent, and Biden is the second choice of 17 percent.

At the same time, Warren has work to do to win over voters who aren’t currently backing one of the other top-polling candidates (Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris). Among supporters of the many candidates polling below 5 percent, 20 percent have Biden as their second choice and 18 percent have Warren. This appears to be a function of ideology, as the lower-tier candidates’ supporters tend to be more moderate.

AD

AD

But views about Warren may also be less crystallized. Seventy-two percent of Democrats say they have a favorable impression of her, trailing Sanders (79 percent) and slightly better than Biden (69 percent). But 12 percent don’t know enough to give her a rating, twice as many as her two main rivals. Assuming Warren continues to get lots of media attention, that number will almost certainly diminish.

The implication of all this is that among the three front-runners, Warren appears to be in the best position to pick up supporters when other candidates start to pull the plug.

Warren’s rise isn’t about women

Finally, the GW Politics Poll also suggests that Warren’s rise is not being driven mainly by an increase in support among female voters. In an analysis for FiveThirtyEight in September, Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux found that Warren’s polling for most of the campaign had been about three points higher among women than men. In a reversal, our survey has Warren as the first choice of 29 percent of men and 26 percent of women.

AD

AD

That suggests that an increase in the support of male voters is responsible for at least part of Warren’s recent trajectory. And the shift of the men’s vote may have come at Biden’s expense. Although Thomson-DeVeaux’s analysis found Biden polling roughly equally with men and women, in our survey he is at 22 percent among women but just 15 percent among men.

Of course, this one poll is a snapshot, and the state of the race remains fluid. But as the candidates take the debate stage Tuesday night, the recent news for Warren certainly appears favorable, especially as Biden and Sanders continue to contend with distractions on the campaign trail.

“It’s just human nature,” Miller said. “The worst enemy you face in a pandemic could well be your neighbor.”

Miller, along with about 100 other people who he says have purchased Fortitude Ranch memberships, believes that underground bunkers, stockpiled food, and semiautomatic weapons will see them through an apocalypse, however it may come.

Some preppers — people who invest significant amounts of money and time in preparing for anything from a natural disaster to the collapse of civilization — think the end may come sooner than later. In addition to worrying about overpopulation, climate change, economic collapse and war, some also fret about politics. With impeachment in the air and tensions building toward the 2020 presidential race, preppers warn that violence could erupt in this fiercely polarized nation.

AD

“You know, people use the term ‘civil war,’ and that seems hard to imagine, but what started World War I? Some guy assassinated a minor archduke,” Miller said. “. . . Stuff escalates unpredictably.”

The scenario most often advanced by ranch members concerns the possibility of a disputed election. There’s fear by some members that if President Trump loses, he might blame cheating and refuse to step down. Others believe that if Trump wins, his opponents might also blame the outcome on fraud, triggering unrest. It’s not a scenario Miller thinks likely, but he’s heard it from both sides.

AD

Trump, in one of a series of tweets trying to discredit the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats, has stoked tensions further, suggesting his removal from office could trigger a “Civil War like fracture.”

AD

That’s the scenario David L. Jones, a Fortitude Ranch member who’s also something of a celebrity prepper, believes could set off unrest. Jones, 62, a former Alaska state trooper and Army veteran, is known as the “NBC Guy” because of his military background in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. He has also worked in state and federal emergency management agencies. He has a podcast and was one of this year’s featured speakers at Prepper Camp, a three-day symposium that attracted more than 1,000 off-the-gridders, survivalists and homesteaders to a private campsite last month in North Carolina. Jones said he foresees turmoil, and perhaps violence, whether Trump wins or loses.

“You see, the veneer of civilization is very thin,” Jones said.

Fortitude Ranch occupies more than 50 acres within the George Washington National Forest. Its serene setting belies talk of catastrophe. On a recent tour, there were green mountain vistas just below the clouds and a stillness broken only by the soft patter of rain on leaves.

Members, who pay about $1,000 per person per year to be a part of the community, are encouraged to use the ranch’s two large rustic cabins here as vacation lodgings. In the event of emergency, however, they would head to 10-by-10-foot, claustrophobia-inducing rooms in underground shelters, some of which are constructed of metal culverts. Altogether, the compound here can hold up to 500 people.

The organization also has two sites in Colorado. It’s working to set up a fourth in Wisconsin. The motto: “Prepare for the Worst — Enjoy the Present.”

The camp is a reflection of a survivalist movement that has grown in recent years, although reliable numbers are hard to find. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which analyzes community preparedness, doesn’t track survivalists. And many preppers are reluctant to identify as such or discuss their activities, fearing that attention could attract marauders when things go south — or “s--- hits the fan,” in prepper parlance.

The number of preppers also tends to expand and recede in sync with social crises, both real and imagined. (Remember Y2K?) But interest appears to have grown since the Great Recession. Google searches for terms such as “survivalist” began ticking upward in mid-2008 as the economic crisis deepened. Reality TV — “Doomsday Preppers” on the National Geographic Channel in 2011 and “Apocalypse Preppers” on the Discovery Channel in 2013 — fed the end-of-days craze and fed off it.

AD

24/7WallSt.com, a financial news website, estimated in 2013 that there are 3.7 million preppers and a multibillion-dollar market that includes “bugout gear” such as freeze-dried foods, water purification systems, crossbows and tools. Businesses such as the Ready Store and the website Doomsday Prep have built on the movement, too.

AD

David Sanders, Doomsday Prep’s owner, launched the online store near Atlanta in 2012. Although Sanders declined to provide exact sales figures, he said that except for a flat year or two around 2015, the business has had annual growth of about 25 percent. His orders increase in sync with disasters or other bad news, such as the outbreak of Zika virus.

The bitterly divided political atmosphere is a driver right now, Sanders said. But his typical customer is someone who thinks about enduring a power outage for a few days, not a nuclear holocaust, although the website sells supplies and equipment for that, too.

“Preparedness is a choice for empowerment, security and peace of mind,” he said. “Why would anyone not choose that?”

Miller’s experience with doomsday scenarios goes back to the Cold War. He’s a retired colonel in U.S. Air Force intelligence. He’s also a Harvard PhD, cryptocurrency consultant and author of a post-apocalyptic novel, “Rohan Nation: Reinventing America after the 2020 Collapse.” He’s disdainful of the recent prepper craze, especially the reality TV shows that often focus on the most wide-eyed survivalists and hold them up for ridicule.

Raymond Andrew Miller, 61, grew up in Lincoln, Neb., about an hour’s drive from the U.S. Strategic Air Command at Offutt Air Force Base, a prime target for the Soviet Union. Yet, Miller said, he didn’t dwell on the threat of nuclear annihilation, even after reading somewhere that Soviet ICBMs were accurate only to within about 60 miles.

“I thought, ‘Oh, that’s great. They’re going to aim for Offutt, and it’s going to land in Lincoln,’ ” Miller said.

He volunteered for the Civil Air Patrol when he was 13 years old. He entered the U.S. Air Force Academy, graduating in 1980 with a double major in history and international affairs. He obtained masters and PhD degrees at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. His dissertation argued that NATO troops could survive a Warsaw Pact nuclear blitz at little cost if the allies built 10,000 inexpensive shelters using metal culverts with some dirt on top.

“Three feet of earth is kind of the magic number,” Miller said. “That’s why at Fortitude Ranch we have shallow underground facilities. No one’s going to drop a penetrating multi-megaton nuclear warhead in our area.”

Miller has analyzed other lethal threats, too, particularly pandemics, that he thinks are more likely to occur than another civil war. He noted that the 1918-1920 “Spanish flu” pandemic alone killed an estimated 30 million people. The next such outbreak could be started with a genetically engineered pathogen that has been designed to be more lethal and resistant to treatment, Miller said.

He also wants to ensure Fortitude Ranch could survive natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina; the eruption of a supervolcano, such as the one below Yellowstone National Park; or widespread civil disorder, such as occurred during the 1977 New York City blackout when rioting broke out and nearly 2,000 businesses were burned or looted. He wants the ranch to be prepared for nuclear attack, economic collapse or an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), a massive burst of energy that could fry the nation’s electrical grid.

There are stockpiles of food, ranging from homemade preserves to cafeteria-sized cans and buckets of emergency rations, and a small greenhouse, along with seeds specially created to withstand long shelf lives. There are also chickens, milk goats and — in Colorado — cattle.

The ranch also has radio gear and solar- and propane-powered electrical generators, along with supplies of coal, kerosene and wood. Down the hill from the main bunker is a burn pit to dispose of contaminated bodies during a pandemic. Miller said he’s already tested the pit with a dead goat.

Miller and assistant camp managers are armed, and members receive training in using AR-15 semiautomatic rifles or pump-action shotguns for self-defense, but he emphasized that his group is not allied in any way with anti-government militias.

“We’re not gun nuts,” Miller said.

Miller has never had to shoot at anyone, although he came under rocket and mortar fire while serving in Iraq.

But he said he is prepared to do whatever is necessary defend himself, his family and members of Fortitude Ranch. There’s a saying among preppers — “72 hours to animal” — that suggests anyone can become dangerous when desperate.

“I think it’s more like 72 seconds,” Miller said.

And yet his worst nightmare is imagining a mother arriving at the camp’s gates with a starving child during a pandemic and asking for help. Survival discipline, he said, requires even they be turned away."

In a show of grace, Brandt Jean hugged his brother’s killer in court on Wednesday and forgave her. “If you are truly sorry,” Jean told Amber Guyger, “I know I can speak for myself, I forgive you.” Guyger had been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison for killing Botham Jean in his home. She claimed to have mistaken his apartment for hers, which was the unit below, and the 26-year-old black man eating ice cream on his couch for an intruder. The hug was a surprise in a trial full of them. Guyger was a Dallas police officer at the time of the shooting, and the impunity with which police kill seemed bound to shield her from legal consequences. It did not, but the approval that greeted her conviction soured after the jury announced her sentence, which some deemed too lenient. Backlash too greeted Brandt Jean’s display: Some faulted the deceased’s brother for being too magnanimous. Others criticized a culture that valorizes black forgiveness but demands few changes to the norms and practices that make it necessary. As if on cue, praise for Jean poured in from Senator Ted Cruz and the Dallas Police Department. “Amidst heartbreaking tragedy, a beautiful, powerful example of Christian love & forgiveness,” Cruz tweeted. “Botham Jean’s brother’s request to hug Amber Guyger … [represents] a spirit of forgiveness, faith, and trust,” wrote the police.

To forgive the person who killed one’s brother is a deeply personal act. Brandt Jean, who is a Christian, seems to have done so for himself and in accordance with his faith, not to excuse Guyger’s crime or exonerate the society that permitted it. But the specter that hovered over his decision was still power and what it demands from its subjects. Too much of black life is spent reassuring others that we mean them no harm to ignore this reality. The resulting frustration is well earned; self-preservation should not rest on such assurances. Whether these concerns informed Jean’s decision is known only to him, but of note is that his mother, Allison Jean, called on Guyger to change and the police to retrain and will receive few of the plaudits that her son did. That’s because too often, forgiveness is palatable because it lacks institutional power — the might to forgo it and force a reckoning for those who’ve done wrong. As Americans, we’ve rarely had the luxury of seeing what grace looks like when it is practiced by powerful people, instead of scorned and only celebrated when it facilitates their absolution.

Black grace is so potent and so vaunted a force in part because its alternative inspires so much fear. D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation (1915), America’s highest-grossing film prior to 1939, famously reimagined Reconstruction as a time when vengeful ex-slaves “[asserted] an abusive dominion over Southern whites,” as The New Yorker’s Richard Brody writes. Of course, the opposite was true — black leaders were known to govern toward the common good and did so by expanding the franchise and establishing public schools across the South. But Griffith’s revisionism gripped the public imagination, with screenings at the White House and a subsequent resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. Rather than fade with time, its articulation of white anxiety found new outlets. Barack Obama’s presidency was one, generating a flood of baseless claims about the ills it supposedly heralded. “[The] president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race — on the side that favors the black person,” said Representative Steve King. Under Obama’s governance, claimed Rush Limbaugh, “the white kids now get beat up, with the black kids cheering, ‘Yeah, right on, right on, right on.’” This preoccupation with black vengeance is expressed as confusion as well as conspiratorial panic: After Senator Kamala Harris confronted Joe Biden during the first Democratic primary debate about his opposition to busing, Chris Matthews asked her incredulously, “How did you come out of that and not have hatred toward white people generally?”

It remains unfathomable for some, to the point that they’ll fabricate black vengeance out of whole cloth, that all black people aren’t consumed by an open loathing for white people, considering the violence that has marked our American experience. That black disaffection is so infrequently expressed through violence seems less attributable to our uniquely forgiving nature than to the fact that even our milder expressions of frustration — peaceful protests, seeking greater accountability from public officials — are met with rage by forces that outnumber and could easily overpower and kill us. This is not to reduce all displays of black grace to fears of backlash. But our power deficit explains why so few American institutions feel compelled to echo that grace or reciprocate it. Much was made of the black families from Charleston, South Carolina, who forgave an unrepentant Dylann Roof for killing their loved ones in 2015. Less thought was given to the irony of the U.S. Department of Justice meeting that grace by swiftly scheduling Roof’s execution.

The disconnect between public celebrations of black forgiveness and America’s zeal for imprisoning more of its citizens per capita than any other country in the world is equally telling. The question arises of how much grace truly matters to some of its proponents when it’s not being used to reassure them that committing violence against black people will have no long-term consequences. Evidence abounds that grace is politically toxic. Candidates for judgeships, sheriffs’ offices, and prosecutors’ offices regularly lose elections for being seen as too lenient. So did Michael Dukakis. Trump’s entire presidency is predicated on selectively withholding grace from those he and his supporters deem unworthy. Meanwhile, grace was so stridently demanded of President Obama that he couldn’t criticize a white police officer without subsequently inviting him to a beer summit.

It’s worth considering what our culture of forgiveness would look like if black people weren’t forced to weigh the threat of white violence. How would removing that suspended guillotine impact the impulse to extend grace? Brandt Jean was acting according to his faith, no doubt, but it’s hard to separate his gesture from the potential costs of attrition. More important, it seems likely that grace practiced by a people with the power to enforce their treatment as equals and who insist on doing so would lose much of its charm. We may never know. As of now, the only forces with the power to both be gracious and ensure justice regularly refuse to do it. The result is a nation that revels in black forgiveness but remains profoundly unaccountable to black people."

After the last Democratic presidential-candidates debate in Houston on September 12, I adjudged the event as having little impact on the dynamics of the race. Sure, some candidates may have marginally helped themselves (Elizabeth Warren, as always, and probably Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, and Beto O’Rourke) and others may have hurt themselves (Julián Castro and Kamala Harris). But the overall dominance of the field by the Big Three (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren) was undisturbed.

In part, the lack of drama in Houston was attributable to the lack of friction between Biden and Warren during their long-awaited first debate appearance on the same stage. Yes, Bernie Sanders was aggressively hostile to Biden’s criticisms of Medicare for All (the topic that debate moderators appear to find endlessly fascinating, at the expense of all others). But no one seemed to exude a sense of urgency about the competition, and so needles did not move.

Or did they? Whether or not the last debate made any difference, the dynamics have changed thanks to Warren’s steady rise in the polls and other indicators of candidate strength. On the day of the Houston debate, Biden had a ten-point lead over Warren in the RealClearPolitics national polling averages, and Warren was virtually tied with Sanders. Now Warren is virtually tied with Biden, with Sanders more than ten points back. On the fundraising front, Warren, like Sanders, is relying on small-dollar contributions, and like Sanders did very well in the quarter than ended on September 30 (Sanders reported $25.3 million raised, and Warren $24.6 million; Biden was significantly behind at $15.2 million). And probably most importantly, Biden’s perceived electability advantage may be eroding, as Warren is doing much better than before in head-to-head trial heats against Trump (Biden’s average lead over Trump is now 6.9 percent; Sanders’s is 5.3 percent; and Warren’s is 5.2 percent). There’s really not a lot of distance separating the Big Three — or, if you prefer, the two co-front-runners — on this particular measure of electability. And Warren’s favorability ratio among Democrats is now, according to the Morning Consult tracking poll, at 68/14; Biden’s is 73/20, and Sanders’s is 73/19.

Add in the fact that Warren now leads in the polling averages for the first two contests, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, and you can see why she rather than Biden may have a bull’s-eye on her back in the fourth debate. Reinforcing that possibility is the fact that Biden is in such a delicate position thanks to the central role he and his son Hunter are playing in the impeachment drama that has gripped Washington. His campaign has already pointedly warned rivals not to bring up the subject in the next debate. And if they (or more likely the moderators) do “go there,” then the former veep may chew scenery as the victim of a Trump smear, or as the candidate so terrifying to Trump that he risked impeachment to promote the smear.

So all in all, if anyone is to become a target in Ohio, it may be Warren. But she won’t be an easy target. For one thing, she is a skillful debater (none of the other candidates, so far as I know, went to college on a debate scholarship) who manages to convey passion without attacking other candidates, and is steadily improving her already strong ability to get wonky while remaining relatable to regular folks. And she’s pretty good at generating zingers, as she showed at the most recent multi-candidate forum (as reported by The Guardian):

During the CNN forum on LGBT issues on Thursday, Morgan Cox, the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked Warren how she would react to a supporter who said: “I’m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.”

Warren replied: “Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. And I’m going to say, then just marry one woman. I’m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.”

That’s already gone viral.

Another problem with going after Warren is that the most savage GOP talking points about her are not about things Democrats are likely to touch with a ten-foot pole. Yes, she received extensive progressive criticism late last year for the DNA test she took the rebut conservative claims she had faked a Native American identity. But at this point, raising the subject just reinforces Trump’s interminably offensive “Pocahontas” labeling of Warren. The latest pseudo-scandal about Warren, a dubious claim that she made up an incident where she was “shown the door” as a teacher when she was pregnant, has aroused a some sympathy for her, particularly among women. No Democrat will bring that up, either, and if moderators do, then other candidates may well leap to her defense.

Perhaps one of the more “moderate” candidates who are lagging in the polls, such as Buttigieg, O’Rourke, or Amy Klobuchar, could bring out the old shillelagh of “too far left” for Warren or “too expensive” for her policy proposals. But they have to be careful about sounding like they are repeating Republican talking points. And such talk could tempt moderators into yet another endless discussion of Medicare for All and its effect on private insurance and tax rates — a discussion likely to give Warren and Sanders a disproportionate share of debate time.

Speaking of Bernie Sanders, no candidate’s standing is more threatened than his by Warren’s recent good fortune. And clearly, some of his supporters would like him to take her down a notch. But so far, both of these candidates have resisted various pressures to get them at odds with each other. And in the Ohio debate, Sanders may be less focused on Warren than on projecting sound health and renewed determination after his recent heart attack.

So to come full circle, could the real clash in Ohio be between Warren and Biden after all? As the candidate for whom everything’s coming up roses lately, Warren would seem to have little to gain by going on the attack at this point. And as noted above, Biden may have other fish to fry in dealing with — or perhaps exploiting — the impeachment saga. But sometimes unexpected things can happen in debates, particularly if a moderator springs a surprise or skillfully foments a fight. But all in all, the strongest debater in the field is the least likely to stumble, and stumbles by others could continue to frustrate those dismayed for one reason or another by Warren’s success."

Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. And so it makes sense that in the course of a Democratic presidential nominating contest in which a vast army of observers wait with bated breath for the long-delayed but perhaps inevitable collapse of support for Joe Biden, at least one of his lower-tier rivals is auditioning to become his successor in the affections of self-consciously “moderate” voters.

Sahil Kapur has noticed Pete Buttigieg’s look-me-over pitch to this large element of the Democratic electorate in Iowa:

Pete Buttigieg is pitching himself as an alternative to moderate Democrats who might not be sold on Joe Biden.

On a recent bus tour of Iowa, Buttigieg framed his argument, emphasizing the need to “re-center our politics” and recapture the notion of freedom and faith from conservatives who he says use those terms to “club people over the head.”

Mayor Pete is not, to be clear, a member of some formal ideological faction of the Democratic Party, like Bill Clinton was a member of the aggressively centrist Democratic Leadership Council. He’s more like Barack Obama, who eschewed ideological labels but deployed messaging (and, as president, policies) that appealed to voters and opinion leaders wary of the kind of anti-corporate “populism” that has consistently animated the labor-left elements of the party. Buttigieg’s status as the first viable openly gay (and married) presidential candidate serves to broaden his appeal in nonideological ways, just like Obama’s African-American identity. But Kapur offers examples of the South Bend mayor’s centrist messaging:

His “re-centering” message is designed to counter Republican caricatures of Democrats — he told Iowans that “freedom” isn’t just about businesses having fewer regulations, it’s about being free of crippling health care costs; and he says big government should get out of the way of women making reproductive choices.

More conspicuously, Mayor Pete touts his record as a military veteran with service in Afghanistan (an increasingly rare credential for politicians of either party), and he is both religiously observant and more than willing to blast the Christian right for its arrogant claims to speak for the Almighty while peddling its entirely secular conservative agenda. These are thematics that voters don’t hear from the economics-focused Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And while Buttigieg tries to be a bit subtle about it, the 37-year-old candidate emulates the Bill Clinton of 1992 by offering a generational critique of older pols as caught up in ancient ideological conflicts that don’t lead to solutions. This shot at Elizabeth Warren is characteristic:

“She and I are after the same goals,” he said of Warren. “But her pitch has a lot more to do with fighting — she’s more interested in the fighting part of it. I’m more interested in outcomes.”

Buttigieg’s policy stances also echo past centrist preoccupations, including a Clintonesque push for national service and, more famously, a “Medicare If You Want It” health-care proposal that is a lot like the original Obamacare plan in offering a choice between public and private insurance. His national-security agenda is more conventionally liberal-internationalist than that of most of his rivals, and his team of national-security advisers is led by Doug Wilson, an Obama Pentagon official and a former political director at the DLC (where I was one of his colleagues, for the record). When Buttigieg criticized Biden for representing a failed ideology of neoliberalism, lefty critics hooted derisively, calling Buttigieg the authentic neoliberal candidate. He hasn’t really triangulated against this sort of criticism from Team Democratic Socialist, but he might in the near future.

Obviously enough, this turn-to-the-center gambit by Buttigieg won’t work unless Biden finally begins to fade. And he has another problem, too: Democratic moderates have dominated the party in the past via a strong African-American voting base. That was true of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Al Gore (in his less progressive phase), Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. It was even true to some extent of John Kerry in 2004, who did surprisingly well among black primary voters while appealing to electability-focused voters worried about Howard Dean’s alleged radicalism.

The black-moderate alliance is fundamental to Biden’s continuing strength, of course. And unfortunately for Mayor Pete, and despite stout efforts (e.g., his Douglass Plan for racial justice), you could currently fit his black support base comfortably within one of those Iowa diners he has visited recently.

There are various explanations for Buttigieg’s exceptionally honkified following: his cerebral, multilingual “wine track” rhetoric, which tends to appeal to more affluent and college-educated white voters; his sexual orientation, with which we are told many African-Americans (particularly those who belong to Evangelical churches) are still uncomfortable; and above all, his history of conflict with black activists in South Bend unhappy with how he has handled police-brutality complaints — most recently after a fatal police shooting of an apparently innocent black man in June. Indeed, this may be the only aspect of his mayoral tenure in South Bend that has gained widespread national attention.

Mayor Pete’s problems with black voters aren’t particularly important to the categorical imperative he shares with others candidates to make a very good showing in lily-white Iowa. He is pouring his considerable resources (his second- and third-quarter fundraising hauls have been extremely impressive; his total contributions are at $51 million for the year) into the first-in-the-nation caucus state, where the RealClearPolitics polling average has him virtually tied with Bernie Sanders for third place. Aside from positioning him to exploit any Biden weakness (which the impeachment drive’s focus on a Ukraine scandal in which Uncle Joe’s last name is going to be mentioned a lot may exacerbate) — and Biden’s already struggling in Iowa — a strong Iowa showing could fatally undermine the viability of other possible pretenders to the mantle of Biden Alternative for Moderates, such as Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker. In the recent gold-standard Selzer Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Buttigieg held 9 percent as compared to Harris’s 6 percent and Klobuchar’s and Booker’s 3 percent.

If Buttigieg does have something of an Iowa breakthrough — and particularly if the two major African-American candidates immediately fade — then he can hope minority voters give him a second look. It wouldn’t hurt his midwestern white-working-class appeal to get off the “wine track,” either. But understandably, he’s putting first things first, and surviving Iowa is job one."

This is the first of an opportunity to play six more league games.”

AD

AD

The Yellow Jackets have had plenty of practice putting disappointment in the past. They’ve lost three in a row, including an overtime defeat against The Citadel of the FCS, and their only victory came against a South Florida team that had lost its previous eight games.

This was always going to be a difficult transition from Paul Johnson’s option-oriented offense to new coach Geoff Collins’ pro-style scheme, which has made the entire season an exercise in patience.

And while they are coming off a 38-22 loss to North Carolina, they found some things to build upon: They gained a season-best 321 total yards and they averaged 6.1 yards per play — their best performance against a team from the Bowl Subdivision.

AD

“We talk about going 1-0 every week and 1-0 every day,” Collins said. “Everything in the program matters. We just focus on the improvement and the results will take care of themselves. You can’t look in the past. All you can do is learn from it. I think our guys have adopted that attitude and they go out there with unbelievable attitude.”

AD

Some other things to know about the Georgia Tech-Duke game:

FAMILIAR SYSTEM

The Blue Devils have yet to face Collins but they have previously prepared for his system during the 2018 postseason. Collins’ team at Temple earned an invitation to the Independence Bowl to face Duke and the Owls continued to run his scheme after he was hired by Georgia Tech in December. Duke shut Temple out in the second half of a 56-27 victory.

AD

NEW QB

Georgia Tech redshirt freshman James Graham certainly looked comfortable at quarterback. He was 11 of 24 for 171 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in his first start of the season last week against North Carolina. His 219 total yards were the most by a Yellow Jackets QB this season.

ANOTHER OPTION

A team figures to once again run the option offense in a Georgia Tech-Duke game — but for a change, it’s the Blue Devils and not the Yellow Jackets. Duke occasionally has sprinkled some triple-option plays into its game plans this season, breaking them out in the opening loss to Alabama and using them to fuel the comeback against Pitt.

AD

AD

BALL SECURITY

The Blue Devils will need to take better care of the ball after turning it over six times in the Pitt loss, with QB Quentin Harris responsible for five of those giveaways. It was just the third time since 2000 that Duke had six turnovers in a game — and not surprisingly, the Blue Devils were 0-3 in them.

The United States and South Korea have a burden-sharing agreement stemming from a 1953 mutual defense treaty after the halt of the Korean War. As part of the agreement, roughly 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.

The cost of maintaining an American military presence to aid in South Korea’s defense against North Korea has been a point of tension in recent months, particularly after President Trump inaccurately claimed during a February Cabinet meeting that “South Korea is costing us $5 billion a year. And they pay — they were paying about $500 million for $5 billion worth of protection.”

AD

According to a previous analysis by The Washington Post, South Korea’s payment to the U.S. last year was around $830 million, which covered approximately 40 percent of the cost of the U.S. deployment; the total cost for the United States is closer to $1.25 billion, not the $5 billion figure Trump stated.

AD

U.S. military bases have a complex history in South Korea, due to politics as well as their association at times with prostitution, black markets and other vices. Yet even if hostilities were defused between North and South Korea, many South Koreans support an ongoing U.S. presence.

By the end of the year, the United States will complete the move of its largest foreign military base from Seoul, where it’s been for 70 years, to the massive new Camp Humphreys facility roughly 45 miles to the south.

AD

In August, Trump called for South Korea to pay more for military protection by U.S. forces. Officials from Seoul and Washington are scheduled to meet in Hawaii next week for another round of negotiations on the burden-sharing agreement.

8:45 p.m.: Giuliani continues to get blowback from some Republicans

Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has come under criticism from some Republicans for his unpredictable TV appearances and his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate Biden.

AD

On Tuesday night, he continued to face blowback.

“I think it was a mistake to dispatch him on some kind of diplomatic mission,” Fox News Channel legal analyst Andrew Napolitano said of Giuliani, who was issued a subpoena by four House committee chairs on Monday.

AD

While it remains unclear whether Giuliani was acting as an attorney or as a diplomat during his visits to Ukraine and elsewhere, Napolitano said, “if Rudy was acting as a diplomat, then there’s no privilege in his communications.”

“I suspect we’re going to hear less from Rudy, because he now has a lawyer … who will basically say, ‘Mr. Mayor, zip it,’” he added.

7:50 p.m.: Trump hauls out the rhetorical heavy artillery, accuses Democrats of ‘COUP’

AD

In Tuesday night tweets, Trump escalated his attacks on Democrats, arguing that “what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP.”

Democrats’ actions, he claimed, are “intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!”

AD

The president is bringing the rhetorical heavy artillery to the most serious challenge to his presidency in nearly three tumultuous, norm-busting, warp-speed years in office.

Expanding on the lexicon of outrage and victimhood honed during the probe into Russian interference in the last election, Trump is invoking the muskets-and-ramparts idioms of the country’s beginnings.

AD

The ratcheting up of his rhetoric is also indicative of Trump’s tendency to interpret any criticism of him as an attack on the government, worrying critics and scholars who warn of the dangers posed by his l’état, c’est moi call to arms.

6:25 p.m.: What can Congress do if Mike Pompeo won’t cooperate with its impeachment inquiry?

A major early step of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is to talk to the top administration officials who would have had knowledge about Trump’s work with Ukraine.

But like a number of other high-profile Trump administration officials, Pompeo is resisting. And Congress may not have a lot of options left to force potentially key players in its impeachment inquiry to speak to it. The rule book for how to be a check on the executive branch doesn’t include an executive branch unwilling to cooperate.

AD

Pompeo is staking his argument on both procedural and political grounds. Procedurally, he accuses Democrats of not providing a technical document, called a Notice of Deposition, to have his staff testify. He says they were not given enough time, and he is demanding that State Department lawyers be present during testimony to assert executive privilege.

A group pushing for Trump’s impeachment is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks -- the first major pro-impeachment advocacy spending since the House launched their formal inquiry last week.

The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that it will spend more than half of the overall campaign total on television ads, with the rest underwriting digital ads.

5:15 p.m.: Volker, Yovanovitch will appear before House panels this week

Volker had held the Ukraine job part-time for the past two years until his resignation last week.

Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who had originally been scheduled to appear before the committees Wednesday, will instead appear Oct. 11, according to the official.

Yovanovitch was recalled from her position in Ukraine this year amid a flurry of political attacks by conservative media and other allies of Trump, including Giuliani, who targeted her with wild accusations and argued that she “should be part of the investigation as part of the collusion.”

5 p.m.: State Department inspector general to meet with Hill committees Wednesday

Key committees on Capitol Hill were notified Tuesday that the State Department’s inspector general has requested to speak with them Wednesday “to discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine,” according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

AD

The offer by the office of Steve Linick, which operates mostly independently from the State Department and is responsible for investigating abuse and mismanagement, comes amid a standoff between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and House Democrats demanding documents and testimony on Ukraine-related matters for their impeachment inquiry.

Linick’s office “obtained the documents from the acting legal adviser of the Department of State,” the letter said. The inspector general doesn’t have to seek Pompeo’s approval to approach the Hill with information, especially if it is not classified.

It is unclear exactly what Linick will provide the committees, which include the panels in charge of foreign relations, intelligence, appropriations and oversight in the House and Senate. But the demand for any credible information related to Ukraine and the State Department is at a fever pitch as Democrats seek to build the case for Trump’s ouster out of his dealings with Ukraine’s leadership.

Earlier Tuesday, Pompeo suggested that Foggy Bottom would not acquiesce with Democratic lawmakers’ demands to interview several State Department officials, alleging “serious substantive and procedural deficiencies” with their investigation.

He said Democrats were trying to “intimidate” and “bully” his colleagues at the State Department.

4:30 p.m.: Hillary Clinton to Giuliani: ‘Yes, I am famously under-scrutinized.’

Giuliani tweeted that the news media is attacking him because he’s the messenger and it wants to cover up the message of “Dem corruption.”

“Meanwhile, they have yet to ask Biden difficult questions because he is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation!” Giuliani wrote.

To which Hillary Clinton responded, on Twitter, “Yes, I am famously under-scrutinized.”

There is, of course, no shortage of controversies that dogged Clinton and her husband during their decades in public life. In fact, an investigation into the Clintons’ real estate investments, famously known as the Whitewater scandal, led investigators to Monica Lewinksy and resulted in President Bill Clinton’s impeachment over his lying under oath and obstruction of justice.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) sent letters to Vice President Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry inquiring about whether they had any role in Trump’s asking Ukraine for information that could help him in the 2020 election.

In his letter to Pence, Menendez noted the vice president’s canceled trip to Ukrainian President Zelensky’s inauguration and then his meeting with Zelensky in September. Menendez’s letter questions whether Pence spoke to Zelensky about the hold on U.S. military assistance and the desire for information about former vice president Joe Biden’s son.

Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also asked Perry, who went to the inauguration in Pence’s place, how it came about that he led the delegation and whether Trump had asked him to relay a message to any Ukrainian officials about getting assistance in investigating Biden.

“I still have an opportunity as one of the six committees involved in investigating him to help basically determine what is going to go into the impeachment resolution. The six of us will be getting together with our information that we will place on the table and with the speaker,” Waters said in an interview.

Waters also said she’s “very pleased that Trump is finally being caught in some actions that has caused not only Nancy Pelosi to reverse her thinking about impeachment but it is also gotten us to the point where we have support from basically all of our caucus, or most of our caucus, and the American people, it appears.”

2:30 p.m.: House chairmen say Pompeo should ‘immediately cease intimidating’ witnesses

The chairmen of three House committees responded to Pompeo in a statement Tuesday afternoon in which they called on the secretary of state to “immediately cease intimidating” State Department witnesses “in order to protect himself and the President.”

The statement from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Schiff and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) came after Pompeo said that State Department officials would not show up for their scheduled depositions this week.

“Secretary Pompeo was reportedly on the call when the President pressed Ukraine to smear his political opponent,” the chairmen said. “If true, Secretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry. He should immediately cease intimidating Department witnesses in order to protect himself and the President.”

They added that “any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress — including State Department employees — is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.”

“In response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistleblower complaint,” they said.

1:30 p.m.: Waters says Trump should be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said Tuesday that Trump should be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement — but added impeachment “is the imperative.”

Waters, chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, reacted on Twitter to Trump’s recent comments about unmasking the whistleblower and describing those who provided him with information as spies.

“I’m calling on the GOP to stop Trump’s filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed,” Waters tweeted. “Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.”

1:15 p.m.: GOP senator prepares bill intended to call out Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine; Democrat calls it a ‘silly, political hit job’

Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said he plans to introduce a narrowly focused bill to ban immediate family members, specifically parents, children and siblings, of top U.S. political officials, including the president, the vice president, the president’s Cabinet and members of Congress, from earning income in Ukraine.

“The Ukraine government is historically corrupt, which is one way Russia exerts influence there,” Kennedy said in a news release. “The best way to resist temptation is a proper upbringing, a strong set of values and tough laws.”

Though he doesn’t name former vice president Joe Biden or his son Hunter, it’s clear Kennedy’s bill is an attempt to focus attention on Hunter Biden’s former position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump tried to obtain more information about Biden’s work from the Ukrainian president during their July 25 call, which is now the subject of the House’s impeachment inquiry.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) referred to Kennedy’s bill as “obviously a silly, political hit job.” But he tweeted to his colleague that if Kennedy wants to “apply something like this to all foreign countries and make sure it applies to the President’s kids too” then to call him.

12:45 p.m.: Republicans and Democrats spar over Pompeo accusations

Seeking to discredit the impeachment inquiry, House Republicans seized on Pompeo’s contention in a letter that Democratic staffers are trying to “intimidate” and “bully” State Department officials who play a role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.

“Democrats have been trying to impeach the president since the day he was sworn in,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a tweet. “Now they’re harassing civil servants at the State Department to try to achieve their objective. They’re putting their own political interests ahead of the country.”

His comments echoed those of two of Trump’s closest Republican allies in Congress, Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.).

Meadows said in a tweet that Schiff had “made it clear House Democrats are willing to bully and intimidate career professionals as a means to their end goal of politically targeting @realDonaldTrump.”

“It’s unacceptable. It’s damaging to the country. We won’t stand for it,” Meadows added.

Democrats offered a far different take on Pompeo’s letter, which relayed that five State Department employees would not show up this week for depositions requested by House committees.

“If @realDonaldTrump and @SecPompeo were innocent, they would provide witnesses and information for the American people and Congress to clear their names,” tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). “Instead, they are bullying the American people by obstructing Congress and hiding information.”

12:15 p.m.: RNC chairwoman accuses Democrats of a coup d’etat

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel accused House Democrats of attempting a coup d’etat Tuesday.

McDaniel took to Twitter to share an opinion piece written by former House speaker Newt Gingrich in which he argued that what Democrats are doing has “nothing to do with an impeachment.”

“This is a legislative coup d’etat. It is an effort by the hard left, the news media, and the deep state to destroy the president chosen by the American people,” Gingrich wrote.

“I couldn’t agree more!” McDaniel said in her tweet.

12:05 p.m.: The Ukraine story appears to be hurting Trump — and possibly Biden, too

The Ukraine story has spurred Democrats to announce a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and with those developments has come a noted rise in support for impeaching Trump.

But there remains considerable uncertainty among the American public about the Democrats’ underlying Ukraine accusations, according to a new poll. And importantly, a plurality seems to be internalizing Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani’s dubious claims of potential wrongdoing by Joe Biden.

The Monmouth University poll shows people broadly disapprove of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on which Trump asked Ukraine to pursue two investigations that carry potential political benefits for him. Americans say 63 percent to 21 percent that it is “not appropriate” for a president to make such requests of a foreign leader.

12 p.m.: Impeachment inquiry energizing Trump’s online donor base

House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry has generated a flurry of donations through WinRed, the new Republican donation platform designed to capitalize on Trump’s fervent online donor base, officials said Tuesday.

WinRed processed more than $13.7 million in donations from more than 276,000 contributors in the six days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry, officials said Tuesday. Hundreds of thousands of dollars flowed to House GOP “nominee funds,” officials said, referring to the vehicles that raise money for Republican challengers to vulnerable Democrats who support the impeachment inquiry.

“Turning major news events into big time fundraising numbers is a key goal of WinRed — and we had a super-charged example of that last week after Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry against President Trump,” WinRed President Gerrit Lansing wrote in a memo released Tuesday.

Since Pelosi’s announcement, Trump and GOP campaign committees have unleashed a massive push for donations in his defense, bombarding his supporters with appeals via emails, texts, tweets and videos. Such solicitations — often capitalizing on newsworthy moments for the president — have been a mainstay of Trump’s fundraising strategy and have fueled his reelection effort.

WinRed launched in June to make it easier for donors to give in smaller amounts online to multiple GOP candidates and causes, seeking to leverage Trump’s appeal to such donors.

Since then, some House GOP members have resisted adopting the platform, but WinRed officials said more campaigns are coming on board. So far, 60 percent of House GOP members, 76 percent of Republican senators and 92 percent of Republican state parties have adopted the platform, they said.

11:45 a.m.: Corey Lewandowski suggests he won’t run for Senate so he can help Trump’s reelection bid

Trump’s former campaign manager and loyal ally Corey Lewandowski said “it’s fair to say” his plans to run for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire may have changed now that Trump is at the center of an impeachment investigation.

“As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of the United States is reelected,” Lewandowski said on the radio show, “New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.”

Lewandowski had pushed back against rumors last week that he’d been tapped to run an impeachment war room at the White House, but said he’d do whatever the president needed.

11:20 a.m.: Sen. Grassley says whistleblower deserves ‘to be heard out and protected,’ but condemns ‘uninformed speculation’

Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs and co-founded the Senate Whistleblower Protection caucus, released a statement defending the whistleblower’s actions, but reserved judgment about the facts of the intelligence official’s complaint.

“This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,” Grassley said. “We should always work to respect whistleblowers’ requests for confidentiality.”

But Grassley also said no one should pass judgment before hearing directly from the whistleblower. “Uninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn’t serve the country,” the senator said.

Grassley made sure to distinguish, however, his support for hearing out the whistleblower with the House’s impeachment inquiry, saying that “inquiries that put impeachment first and facts last don’t weigh very credibly.”

11 a.m.: Trump takes fresh aim at Schiff, says he should be ‘brought up on charges’

Trump returned to Twitter late Tuesday morning to take fresh aim at Schiff, suggesting that the House Intelligence Committee chairman should be “brought up on charges” for a statement he made during a hearing last week.

“Why isn’t Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States?” Trump tweeted. “This should never be allowed!”

In his statement, Schiff offered an embellished re-creation of Trump’s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said that it was meant as parody, which he said should have been obvious to Trump.

10:30 a.m.: Pompeo says State Dept. officials won’t show up for scheduled impeachment depositions this week

The secretary of state fired a broadside at House Democrats on Tuesday, saying State Department officials scheduled to appear this week before committees conducting the impeachment inquiry would not be made available until “we obtain further clarity on these matters.”

The refusal, in a letter to Engel, described the demand for depositions by five officials who played a role in U.S. relations with Ukraine as “an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly, the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.”

The statements came as Pompeo’s role in the Ukraine investigation broadened with reports that he was a participant in the July 25 call by Trump to the Ukrainian president.

Before that report, first published by The Wall Street Journal, Pompeo had brushed off questions about the incident, saying last week that he had not yet read the transcript of the telephone call released by the White House, or the whistleblower complaint that it sparked.

The committee, along with the House Intelligence and Oversight panels, had requested the five officials to appear for depositions this week and next, to begin Wednesday with Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled by Pompeo as ambassador to Ukraine in May, before the end of her tour.

A 2016 electoral map tweeted by Trump on Tuesday morning included several errors, depicting some counties that Democrat Hillary Clinton carried as counties that he won.

The map was intended to show the breadth of Trump’s support as Democrats move toward impeachment.

9:20 a.m.: Trump calls for learning ‘everything about’ the whistleblower

Trump on Tuesday questioned why he is not “entitled to interview & learn everything about” a whistleblower who filed a complaint against him and whose identity is protected by federal statute.

“So if the so-called ‘Whistleblower’ has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my ‘perfect’ call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren’t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him,” Trump tweeted. “This is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer, or better.”

Andrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer representing the whistleblower, sent a letter on Saturday to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire expressing fears for his client’s safety.

In the letter, Bakaj cited Trump’s remarks last week in which he said whoever gave the whistleblower the information about the call was “close to a spy” and alluded to the death penalty. Bakaj also said that “certain individuals” have issued a $50,000 “bounty” for “any information” relating to his client’s identity.

Trump’s contention that the whistleblower has only secondhand information is at odds with a statement released by Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.

9 a.m.: Hillary Clinton calls Trump’s efforts to out the whistleblower ‘really dangerous’

Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee defeated by Trump in 2016, warned Tuesday that his efforts to unmask the whistleblower are “really dangerous.”

“From everything we know, and we don’t know much, this is an experienced person who saw things that bothered him,” Clinton said during an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “That’s what the whole whistleblower statute is for, and it’s to protect their identity.”

On Monday, Trump told reporters that he was trying to “find out about” the anonymous U.S. intelligence official who filed the complaint. In tweets Sunday night, Trump said he wants to meet his “accuser” and warned of “Big Consequences.”

During her ABC appearance, Clinton said she is confident Democrats will not overplay their hand in the impeachment inquiry.

“I think the evidence concerning Ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable, because it came right out of the White House,” she said. “I know that they will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.”

Clinton is on a tour to promote “The Book of Gutsy Women,” which she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea.

8:35 a.m.: Giuliani seeks to put focus on Hunter Biden’s business dealings

Giuliani sought Monday to focus attention on the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, complaining that the media has not adequately covered the latter’s business dealings in Ukraine and China.

“How corrupted is most of our media if they can’t figure out that Ukraine and China was paying for Biden’s office, not his struggling son’s nonexistent expertise,” Giuliani said. “Every time we lecture them on corruption, they laugh and say you’re no different.”

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Joe Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Hunter Biden also traveled with his father on Air Force Two to China during his tenure as vice president.

Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities.

7:15 a.m.: Trump: ‘Try to impeach this’

Trump pinned to the top of his Twitter feed a largely red 2016 election map with the words “Try to impeach this” emblazoned across it.

The map appears to depict counties Trump won in red and those carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton in blue. Because Clinton, for the most part, won more densely populated parts of the country, many of them on the coasts, the map appears largely red even though Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump, who prevailed in the electoral college.

7:10 a.m.: Trump once again claims his call was ‘PERFECT’

Trump on Tuesday resurrected familiar defenses of his call with Zelensky, calling it “PERFECT” in one of a spate of tweets on the controversy and claiming he is the target of a “HOAX!”

Trump also took fresh aim at Schiff, whom Trump suggested on Monday should be arrested for treason.

“The congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle’ Adam Schiff’s fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019

“The congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle’ Adam Schiff’s fraudulently made up version of the call,” Trump tweeted. “This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!”

In a statement at a hearing last week, Schiff offered an embellished recreation of Trump’s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said that it was meant as parody, which he said should have been obvious to Trump.

During morning tweets, Trump also shared television clips of several allies defending him, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).

In a tweet that included a clip of his appearance Monday night on Fox News, Scalise wrote: “Radicals & socialists have taken over the Democrat Party. They’re calling all the shots now. Just last week, they pressured Pelosi into launching a baseless impeachment inquiry based on false rumors & left-wing rage. This is a witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump, plain & simple.”

During his Tuesday morning tweets, Trump also touched on a few other topics, including a viral video of an airport cart spinning wildly on the tarmac at Chicago’s O’Hare International. In another tweet, he congratulated China on 70 years of Communist rule.

6:30 a.m.: Kamala Harris calls on Twitter to suspend Trump’s account

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) on Monday night called for Twitter to suspend Trump’s account as he continued his attacks on the whistleblower and told reporters he was trying to “find out about” the anonymous U.S. intelligence official who filed the complaint.

“The president’s tweets and his behavior about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,” Harris, a 2020 Democratic White House hopeful, said during a CNN appearance. “If you look at what he’s been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, I frankly think that based on this and all we’ve seen before, including attacking members of Congress, that his Twitter account should be suspended.”

In his tweets Monday, Trump called the complaint lodged by a whistleblower “a fraud.” In tweets Sunday night, Trump said he wants to meet his “accuser” and warned of “Big Consequences.”

6 a.m.: Inspector general pushes back on claims that whistleblower relied solely on hearsay

Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, pushed back Monday on repeated claims by Trump and Republican allies that the whistleblower lacked firsthand knowledge of events and based his claim only on “hearsay.”

In a lengthy statement, Atkinson, a Trump appointee, said it was not true that he found the whistleblower could “provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions.”

“Although the Complainant’s Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President’s July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG’s preliminary review supported the Complainant’s allegations,” the statement said."

In January, teachers in Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest school system, went on strike amid a battle with district leaders over crowded classrooms, depleted staff and the very future of the city’s schools. West Virginia teachers left their classrooms again this year, defeating a measure that would have permitted charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated.

Several teachers successfully ran for public office last year, taking key posts in state legislatures with the promise of restoring school funding.

Chicago teachers, represented by a powerful union in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, last went on strike in 2012. Thursday’s strike idled some 25,000 teachers and 300,000 students.

AD

“You see a common thread from West Virginia to Los Angeles to Chicago,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second-largest teachers union. “It’s about making the sacrifice to help create welcoming and safe environments for our kids and not taking ‘no’ for an answer.”

AD

The Chicago Teachers Union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who faces her first major test as the city’s leader, reached a contract impasse, forcing Lightfoot to cancel classes Thursday. Teachers were joined on the picket lines by special education assistants, bus aides, school security guards and other staff represented by Service Employees International Union Local 73, whose contract negotiations with the city also stalled.

Lightfoot has said the city cannot afford the teachers’ demands, which include a restorative justice coordinator for every school. She told reporters Thursday morning that schools would remain closed until teachers agreed to come back to the classroom.

AD

Leslie Russell, an English teacher at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School who joined the massive rally, said she sees stark disparities between city schools and campuses in more affluent suburbs. Her school has a nurse only one day a week.

AD

“Teachers are not in it for the money,” Russell said. “We are the catalyst for great things kids can do when in optimized conditions.”

Thursday morning, leaders from the Chicago Teachers Union continued negotiations with city officials at Malcolm X College on the Near West Side. Union president Jesse Sharkey told the Chicago Sun-Times that it was unlikely the two sides would strike a deal imminently.

AD

Some who joined teachers on the picket line said they are battling to force Lightfoot to hew to her campaign platform, which emphasized educational justice.

“The mayor ran on a platform of racial and social equity,” 35th Ward Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa told teachers and community members gathered outside Avondale-Logandale Elementary on Chicago’s Northwest Side. “She forgot her campaign promises. You will make her remember.”

AD

About 60 people stood outside the school Thursday morning, waving signs that read “Teachers and students sacrifice too much” and “35 is a speed limit, not a class size.” Passing motorists honked in support.

In addition to bread-and-butter issues, teachers are hoping to force the city to commit to easing a housing crisis that has driven out many of the city’s black residents. More than 16,000 students were counted as homeless in 2018. It means teachers, in addition to educating students, often have to ensure their basic needs are being met.

AD

Lightfoot, who won a landslide victory in April, said at a Wednesday news conference she was dismayed by the union’s job action.

“I was disappointed by the CTU’s decision to begin a work stoppage and force the cancellation of classes,” Lightfoot said. “I feel like we rolled up our sleeves and negotiated in good faith over a long period of time.”

AD

“We reiterated that our proposal was rooted in our admiration for the job that educators and school staffers do every day,” the mayor said.

Elementary special-education teacher and union delegate Katie Osgood recalled working at a school where she had a special education student who was homeless and slept in shelters on the weekend.

AD

“We had to find out if she had food and clean clothes,” Osgood said. “This is what our little guys deal with.”

Destiny Harris, a 2019 graduate of Whitney M. Young Magnet High and an activist, battled the city for months as it prepared to turn a shuttered school into a police academy. She said it was emblematic of how the city prioritized resources.

“Chicago Teachers Union is demanding that students be treated like they matter,” said Harris, now a freshman at Howard University.

AD

Adesuwa Obazee, a preschool teacher at Avondale-Logandale Elementary, said the dearth of resources and staff forces teachers to wear multiple hats: They have to comfort students, make them feel safe and sometimes serve as social workers and nurses. The school nurse visits the campus just once a week.

AD

“We do it all,” Obazee said.

In 2012, teachers battled with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel, pushing back on his efforts to institute merit pay, tie teacher evaluations to standardized test scores and expand charter schools. It made the city a focal point in the debate over an education policy that favored charter schools and evaluating teachers through standardized testing, and strained the relationship between Emanuel and the union. Teachers narrowly averted a strike in 2016 with a last-minute compromise.

AD

Catherine Dalber, a preschool teacher at Lawndale Elementary Community Academy on Chicago’s West Side, said educators confront poverty and stress in their classrooms.

“Every day we go to work, the stress level is sky-high. The kids are not ready to learn, they suffer a great deal of trauma, they are hungry and tired,” Dalber said.

“I can’t do every job.”

And what Altuve had was a bat. And what that bat had in it was one more mighty swing. In the bottom of the ninth inning Saturday night, in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, it propelled a slider from Aroldis Chapman, the New York Yankees’ flamethrowing closer, high over the wall in left — a no-doubt, two-run, walk-off homer that ended the ALCS and put the Astros into the World Series against the Washington Nationals.

They will soon raise another AL pennant in Houston, the second in three years, after the Astros’ dramatic 6-4 victory in Game 6 of the ALCS, which saw them end the Yankees’ season for the third time in five years. Altuve’s homer set off a wild celebration at Minute Maid Park, with the Astros spilling out of their dugout, fireworks and confetti filling the air and a crowd of 43,357 losing its collective mind.

AD

AD

Just a half-inning earlier, the Astros, two outs from clinching, had watched a 4-2 lead evaporate on a two-run homer by Yankees first baseman DJ LeMahieu off closer Roberto Osuna. LeMahieu battled for 10 pitches, fouling off four straight two-strike offerings, before launching his drive to right, which landed in the front row of seats, just out of reach of George Springer’s glove. The blast had Astros players doubled over in anguish and the ecstatic Yankees on the top step of their dugout.

But it was Springer who, in the bottom of the ninth, drew the two-out walk off Chapman to set the stage for Altuve. Facing Chapman, who hadn’t allowed a run to that point in 4 ⅔ innings this postseason, Altuve took two fastballs for balls, took a slider for a strike, then unloaded on a 2-1 slider that hung up in the zone.

“The playoff version of him,” Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said of Altuve, “is spectacular.”

AD

AD

Minutes after the blast, amid all the chaos, Altuve was wandering the infield, a commemorative World Series 2019 cap on his head, pieces of confetti stuck to his sweaty face, looking for his family. Finally, he spotted his two-year-old daughter, Melanie, running toward him. As his face lit up, he scooped her into his arms — and after a hug and a kiss, she immediately began picking the confetti off her father’s face.

“We’re going to the World Series. . . . We’re all celebrating right now,” Altuve said. “We’re not thinking about tomorrow until it comes.”

The Astros are loaded with high-end talent and blessed with ample creativity and resolve — but after the high-wire act they pulled off with their pitching in Game 6, a designated “bullpen” day that stretched their resources to the brink, they were also in desperate need of a day off.

AD

AD

They will essentially get two of them, thanks to Altuve, avoiding a Game 7 on Sunday night and pointing instead toward Game 1 of the World Series against the Nationals on Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park, where they will have ace Gerrit Cole, well-rested and hard-throwing, on the mound.

“To be able to take these next two days, not have to travel, to rest, get our guys ready, because we haven’t faced the Nationals, [and] we don’t know much about them — now we have a couple days to prepare,” Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow said. “And to have Cole on full rest, ready to go in Game 1 and [Justin] Verlander, rested and ready to go in Game 2, it’s exactly what we were hoping for.”

There is a sense the Astros, particular their hitters, still haven’t played their best baseball this month. They are scoring just 3.7 runs per game, and their team OPS (on-base plus slugging) of .645 is more than 200 points below their major-league-leading mark during the regular season. Josh Reddick is hitting just .136, Springer .152, Carlos Correa .171, Yordan Alvarez .171, Yuli Gurriel .209 and Alex Bregman .257. That’s two-thirds of their regular lineup, slumping.

Game 6 nearly turned into a worst-case scenario for the Astros after LeMahieu’s game-tying homer in the ninth. Having led the entire game, they were suddenly in both an emotional hole and a personnel one. They had blown through all the best arms in their bullpen to try to carry their thin lead home, while the Yankees, now in a tie game, still had their closer, Chapman, ready in theirs.

The game had reached a fairly conventional juncture — with both teams deploying their closers in a high-leverage ninth inning — by a very unconventional path. Pushed by a rainout Wednesday night in New York that had altered pitching schedules and wiped out Friday’s scheduled travel day, both the Astros and Yankees opted against using a weaker fourth starter, turning instead to their bullpens to try to piece together 27 outs.

It was a jarring sight given the stakes. It was also, if we’re being honest, kind of fun.

On a 1-to-10 scale of organized chaos, where one is the running of the bulls in Pamplona and 10 is a 3-year-old’s birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese, a double-bullpen game on the second weekend of a League Championship Series is something like a six. Unofficial press box oddsmakers put the over-under on the time-of-game at four hours (it was 4:09), the over-under on pitching changes at 12.5 (there were 12).

By the bottom of the first, the Astros had a 3-0 lead, courtesy of Gurriel’s three-run homer off Yankees “opener” Chad Green. By the top of the second, the Yankees had brought the go-ahead run to the plate. By the bottom of the second, both teams were on their second pitchers of the night. By the top of the third, the Yankees had put the go-ahead run on base, and the game was visited by its fifth pitcher. And on and on it went.

To understand how two exceptional teams, winners of 210 regular season games and payroll-spenders of nearly $400 million between them, with Cy Young winners, multiyear all-stars and future Hall of Famers populating their pitching staffs, wound up with a pair of solid but unheralded relief pitchers starting for them in Game 6 of the ALCS, you must begin with the rise of the opener as a pitching strategy beginning with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2018 — and its subsequent spread across the game.

AD

AD

You must recall, as well, that both teams lost their presumptive No. 4 starters down the stretch — the Astros’ Wade Miley to acute underperformance and the Yankees’ Domingo German to a domestic violence suspension.

And so, Game 6 began at 7:09 p.m. Houston time with Brad Peacock, who had closed out Game 5 for the Astros, on the mound, thus making him the first pitcher since Firpo Marberry of the 1924 Washington Senators to start a playoff game the day after finishing one.

In a game such as this, the managers are bound to have a larger say in the outcome than is typical. New York’s Aaron Boone and Hinch sequenced their pitching with a fluid combination of scripted preferences and on-the-fly reaction. The Astros suffered a setback in the top of the third when Ryan Pressly, at his best a high-leverage monster with an unhittable curveball, suffered a knee injury while fielding a comebacker that stranded the bases loaded. His status for the World Series is unclear.

AD

AD

The Astros spent most of the game trying to protect a slim lead, aided in that mission by a pair of dazzling, diving catches by corner outfielders Reddick in the sixth and Michael Brantley in the seventh. The latter was especially impressive, as it included not only a full-bore, all-out dive to snag Aaron Hicks’s sinking liner, but also a strong throw to first base to double up Aaron Judge, who was trying desperately to get back to the bag.

The Yankees will lament those lost chances, and perhaps the run they conceded in the bottom of the sixth — which pushed the Astros’ lead to 4-2 — by not playing their infield in with runners on the corners, one out and Bregman at the plate, allowing the run to score on a force out when Bregman beat the throw to first.

“The ultimate pain you can feel in sports,” Boone said of Altuve’s walk-off gut-punch. “Just to know how good a club we have, to get back into [the game], and then to end it that way — it’s hard, and our guys are hurting.”

A hundred years ago, the Yankees reached the end of the 1910s without a World Series appearance. On Dec. 26, 1919, they purchased a spindly-legged pitcher-turned-outfielder named Babe Ruth for $100,000 from the Boston Red Sox, won three championships behind him in the 1920s and never again endured a decade without at least getting to the final series — until the decade that comes to a close later this month.

Over the course of their 103-win 2019 season, the Yankees rarely came up against a team that was better. But over six games in this ALCS, and especially there at the very end, it became clear that they finally had — if only by the smallest of margins, a single Altuve."

After largely ignoring Trump’s unsubstantiated allegations that Biden as vice president intervened in Ukrainian politics to help his son’s business ties, Biden has recently switched tactics to confronting the allegations and the president. “Enough is enough,” he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. “Trump won’t destroy me, and he won’t destroy my family.” Some of his supporters warned him that Trump and his conservative media machine will flood the information stage if he doesn’t speak up and call Trump out when he’s wrong. Biden seems to now agree. But it means he’s running an election campaign while still in a primary. And especially for that reason, his team is playing whack-a-mole with Trump allies spreading disinformation on social media and in the media. A recent poll shows a plurality of Americans are wondering if the allegations are true, and at least one of his 2020 opponents said they wouldn’t let family members have such close business ties to their work. In addition, Biden hasn’t shaken off questions about his acuity from sluggish previous debate performances. Given all this, how can Biden show Democratic voters he’s up to the task of such relentless confrontations with Trump?

The debate comes at a tough time for Sanders, who was hospitalized for a heart attack and paused campaigning, right after he shared that he raised the most money of all candidates these past three months. Sanders is 78 and the oldest candidate running for president. He would be the oldest president ever (though Biden and Warren are in their 70s, too, and would set a record if elected). His campaign waited days to announce he had a heart attack and won’t answer questions about how serious it was. The senator from Vermont is resting now and it’s possible Tuesday’s debate will be his first campaign appearance since the heart attack. It’s fair to say his age and health are the last things Sanders will want to talk about on the debate stage — but that’s reality when you’re running for president and every aspect of your life is under scrutiny.

She had a dream first debate this summer, after attacking Biden for his position on school busing. But Sen. Kamala D. Harris failed to translate that momentum to the campaign trail. Her polling has dropped precipitously since this summer, into the single digits, according to an average of top polls from RealClearPolitics. Even her home state, California, is indifferent to her candidacy, reports The Post’s David Weigel. Harris needs an extra-strong debate performance. That will be extra tough to do on a crowded stage of 12 candidates, where the national story is elsewhere, like on impeachment.

Pete Buttigieg

Polling average: 5 percent

The South Bend, Ind., mayor continues to pull in impressive fundraising hauls — $19 million in the quarter that just ended — and has had steady debate performances. But he hasn’t dominated headlines since his entrance in the race, when some compared him to a young Barack Obama. Like Harris, his candidacy just hasn’t gained the traction he needs to reach the first tier. His biggest moments on the debate stages so far have come from criticizing Warren and Sanders’s take-it-or-leave-it liberal policy proposals, so there could be an opening there for him to be more aggressive — and more noticeable.

Cory Booker

The senator from New Jersey has no problem with aggressive campaigning and debating. “Mr. Vice President, there’s a saying in my community, you’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor,” he said in a July debate in a back-and-forth with Biden over their criminal justice reform records. This past week, Biden has been Booker’s ticket again to national headlines. More than the other senators running, Booker leveraged his role as a senator who would be a jurist of Trump’s impeachment by defending Biden from the unsubstantiated Ukraine allegations that Trump peddled to the Ukrainian president. “... If you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me…,” he told CNN last week. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani went after Booker afterward. A few days later, a fired-up Booker got a standing ovation while speaking to a receptive crowd of 300 in Iowa.

Julián Castro, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard

For these candidates, all of whom are polling at 1 or 2 percent, they need to make a moment in this debate. Controversy is always a good bet to get noticed, but there’s a way to take that overboard. (See Castro, former housing secretary, in September’s debate, who appeared to go there on Biden’s age: “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?”)

Tom Steyer

Polling average: 1 percent

The only new person on the debate stage Tuesday will be billionaire Tom Steyer. His campaign to date is mostly self-funded, and he entered the race late, after Biden, Warren and Sanders were already dominating the polls. Steyer is best known for his activism (and his willingness to put money behind it) on climate change and to push Democrats to impeach Trump. Now that impeachment may be happening, can Steyer have an “I told you so?” moment on the debate stage that helps place his candidacy in perspective?

But their disparaging depictions of Ukraine reinforced Trump’s perceptions of the country and fed a dysfunctional dynamic in which White House officials struggled to persuade Trump to support the fledgling government in Kyiv instead of exploiting it for political purposes, officials said.

The role played by Putin and Orban, a hard-right leader who has often allied himself with the Kremlin’s positions, was described in closed-door testimony last week by George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, before House impeachment investigators, U.S. officials said.

Kent cited the influence of those leaders as a factor that helped sour Trump on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the months leading up to their July 25 phone call — a conversation that triggered an extraordinary whistleblower complaint as well as a House impeachment inquiry.

AD

AD

U.S. officials emphasized that while Putin and Orban denigrated Ukraine, Trump’s decision to seek damaging material on Biden was more directly driven by Trump’s own impulses and Kyiv conspiracy theories promoted by his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.

In their early May phone call, Putin “did what he always does” in seeking to undercut the United States’ relationship with Ukraine, said a former U.S. official familiar with details of the conversation. “He has always said Ukraine is just a den of corruption.”

The efforts to poison Trump’s views toward Zelensky were anticipated by national security officials at the White House, officials said. But the voices of Putin and Orban took on added significance this year because of the departure or declining influence of those who had sought to blunt the influence of Putin and other authoritarian leaders over Trump.

AD

AD

Officials cited the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, both of whom had backed U.S. military assistance to Ukraine but were no longer in position to protect that stream of funding when it was suspended in the weeks leading up to Trump’s July 25 phone call.

National security adviser John Bolton was also seen as a fervent backer of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, but his relationship with Trump deteriorated rapidly this year before he was pushed out of the White House last month.

“Over time you just see a wearing down of the defenses,” a former White House official said, describing the struggle to contest the influence of Giuliani, Putin and Orban.

AD

The House impeachment inquiry is centered on Trump’s alleged attempt to use the power of his office to coerce Ukraine into taking measures that the president hoped would help him in the 2020 election.

AD

There is no evidence that Putin spoke about Biden or endorsed Giuliani’s unsubstantiated claims that it was Ukraine — and not Russia — that had interfered in the 2016 election. Still, officials said that treating Ukraine as a pawn is consistent with Putin’s approach toward the former Soviet republic.

American policy has for years been “built around containing malign Russian influence” in Eastern Europe, a U.S. official said. Trump’s apparent susceptibility to the arguments he hears from Putin and Orban is “an example of the president himself under malign influence — being steered by it.”

AD

The official and others spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of internal discussions at the White House and the ongoing impeachment inquiry.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

In his testimony, Kent indicated that U.S. officials were encouraged by Trump’s initial phone call with Zelensky after his April election and hoped the president would see the new leader as a potential partner in long-standing U.S. efforts to help Ukraine fend off Russian aggression and battle internal corruption.

Instead, Kent testified, Trump’s view of Zelensky and Ukraine seemed to sour in the ensuing months, with Trump voicing disdain for Kyiv, ordering the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed, blocking Vice President Pence from attending Zelensky’s inauguration and suspending the flow of $391 million in military and other aid to the country.

AD

Trump spoke with Putin by phone and met with Orban at the White House in the weeks between Zelensky’s April 21 election and his May 20 inauguration. Trump also spoke with Putin on June 28, during a global summit in Japan, and by phone on July 31, days after the call in which he solicited a “favor” from Zelensky.

AD

Trump has consistently refused to accept evidence that Russia interfered on his behalf in the 2016 election. Last week, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that Trump had ordered aid to Ukraine suspended in part to compel Kyiv to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server was taken to Ukraine in 2016 to hide evidence that it was that country, not Russia, that interfered in the presidential election.

In a heated exchange at the White House last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif,) confronted Trump by saying, “With you, all roads lead to Putin.”

AD

Trump turned to Putin for guidance on the new leader of Ukraine within days of Zelensky’s election. In a May 3 call, Trump asked Putin about his impressions of Zelensky, according to a Western official familiar with the conversation. Putin said that he had not yet spoken with Zelensky but derided him as a comedian with ties to an oligarch despised by the Kremlin.

AD

Before running for president, Zelensky starred in a television sitcom in which he portrayed the Ukrainian president.

The May conversation with Putin coincided with a White House visit by Orban that many in the administration had opposed because of the Hungarian leader’s moves to undercut democratic institutions in that country and his combative relations with U.S. allies in Europe.

AD

“I can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that [Trump] would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn’t,” David Cornstein, Trump’s ambassador to Hungary, said in an interview published by the Atlantic this spring.

The May visit from Orban began with an hour-long meeting between Trump and the Hungarian leader with no note-takers, officials said. Bolton and the Hungarian foreign minister joined afterward.

AD

Senior U.S. diplomats said they had limited insight into the private conversation between Trump and Orban, let alone how Trump’s views of Ukraine have formed. But one official familiar with the encounter said that it became “clear that the meeting with Orban had solidified” Trump’s pessimistic view about Kyiv and Zelensky.

Orban’s grievances toward Ukraine are grounded in a historic border dispute and the claimed mistreatment of a Hungarian-speaking minority that resides in Ukraine. But Orban’s animosity toward Zelensky is also ideological, officials said, noting that Zelensky has positioned himself in opposition to Orban as a Western-leaning reformer.

White House and State Department officials had sought to block an Orban visit since the start of Trump’s presidency, concerned that it would legitimize a leader often ostracized in Europe. They also worried about Orban’s influence on the U.S. president.

“Basically, everyone agreed — no Orban meeting,” said a former White House official involved in internal discussions. “We were against it because [we] knew there was a good chance that Trump and Orban would bond and get along.”

The effort to keep distance between Trump and Orban began to fray earlier this year with the departures of senior officials and the emergence of new voices around the president. Among the most important was Mulvaney, who became acting chief of staff in January and was seen as sympathetic to Orban’s hard-right views and skepticism of European institutions. In Congress, Mulvaney’s former Freedom Caucus colleagues last year backed Orban’s efforts to kill a small U.S. grant designed to nurture independent media outlets in Hungary.

Mulvaney’s involvement in approving the Orban visit was one of several instances in which he overruled national security officials, officials said. At the same time, Mulvaney also facilitated an arrangement in which Trump directed other diplomats, including the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, to work with Giuliani on his Ukraine agenda."

For a little while there, Democrats — especially three Democratic senators on the committee who are running for president (Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala D. Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota) — were pinching themselves, wondering if Graham actually made such an enticing offer.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) on Tuesday highlighted a potential dilemma for Giuliani as he decides whether he wants to take up Graham’s offer to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a tweet, Harris responded to Graham’s announcement on Twitter that he asked Giuliani to share his concerns “about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.” “Good. I have questions,” tweeted Harris, who has earned a reputation for her aggressive questioning of witnesses before the committee, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

That would have been the ticket to reverse her drop in the polls. Harris was effective in grilling multiple nominees — including Attorney General William P. Barr, who, by the way, was stumped by her question as to whether Trump ever asked or suggested he investigate someone — as was Klobuchar, who led Kavanaugh to lash out at her question about whether he had engaged in excessive drinking.

AD

Until now, Republicans have been averse to calling Giuliani, both because he might refuse to answer and/or turn the proceedings into a circus, as Corey Lewandowski did. However, the stakes here are extremely high from Giuliani and Trump. If you remember the devastating questioning of Lewandowski undertaken by House Judiciary Committee counsel Barry Berke, you may appreciate how a skilled questioner can expose a witness as a liar and eager Trump accomplice. In the case of Giuliani, who is far less disciplined than Lewandowski, one can only imagine what conversations, communications, meetings and evidence he might reveal.

AD

The reaction of Republicans and Democrats to Graham’s offer should be telling. Democrats, at this point, have a good enough command of the facts to know that Trump, aided by Giuliani, sought foreign assistance from, and held up aid to, Ukraine. They know what Giuliani has said previously. They see a golden opportunity to demonstrate how divorced from reality and contemptuous of the law are Trump and Giuliani. A first-year law student would be able to elicit dangerous admissions from Giuliani.

If Republicans dread the prospect of his testimony, they should ask themselves why they are so afraid to hear Giuliani expound upon his and Trump’s efforts. It might just be that they know the July 25 phone call was not “perfect,” and know full well that a president cannot use a nongovernment official draped in the authority of the president to obtain dirt on a political opponent from foreign governments. They might fear Giuliani’s appearance because he has flat-out admitted to raising the subject of the Bidens with foreign governments and, to boot, has adopted utterly insane conspiracy theories that Trump, his attorney general and a good segment of the Republican Party have bought into.

AD

Graham’s offer really is too good to be true, so do not expect Giuliani to testify under oath. Nevertheless, the reaction to the possibility of his testimony should tell you a lot about the trouble Trump is in, and the impossibility of defending him once somebody (or many bodies) spill the beans.

That electability and support go hand-in-hand means that as support for a candidate drops, so does the perception that the candidate can win the general election. The correlation between the two, in other words, means electability is often just a trailing indicator of primary support anyway.

For former vice president Joe Biden, this was always a looming iceberg. If voters stopped thinking he was the best candidate to beat Trump next year — which they consistently seemed to think — what would happen to his support? Or, conversely (and probably more accurately): If voters stopped supporting him, what would happen to perceptions of his electability?

AD

AD

We’re starting to get an answer to the second question.

On Monday, Quinnipiac University released a poll showing that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had taken a within-the-margin-of-error lead over Biden in national polling. In August, she trailed by 11 points. Now she leads by three.

Comparing the new results to August is more broadly instructive. At that point, Biden had an 11-point lead in support (shown on the vertical axis below) but a 37-point lead on the electability question (left to right). (Quinnipiac asks which candidate “has the best chance” of beating Trump.)

The lines show movement over time: When Biden stumbled badly against Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) in the first Democratic primary debate, his support and sense of electability fell, too, with Harris seeing quick gains on both points. Those gains for Harris have since evaporated.

AD

AD

Notice the diagonal dashed line. Biden had more support on electability in August (49 percent) than overall (32 percent), so his dot is below the diagonal line. Harris at that point was the first pick of 7 percent of Democrats and seen as the most electable by 6 percent, so she was right on the diagonal.

Here’s the shift that happened in the new poll.

Warren had big gains in electability and support. Harris saw both decline.

The other two lines, though, don’t show a link between the two. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) continued to hold steady on the level of support he sees — but the extent to which he’s seen as electable continues to erode. Biden, meanwhile, has seen his overall support sink — but he has also maintained about the same level of electability.

Overall, Warren’s line looks the way you’d expect based on what we’ve seen in the past: up and to the right, gaining support and a sense of electability at the same time. Biden is hanging in there, though, still viewed as having the best chance against Trump by twice as many respondents in Quinnipiac’s poll.

AD

AD

This is national polling, not state polling, so it’s not particularly predictive. But the implication is that the dominant existing calculus — Biden is most electable and, therefore, has the best shot — isn’t as solid as might have been expected.

But, then, we shouldn’t have expected those two things to be as tightly linked as they’ve been presented. We said this in July and will say it again: Biden’s 2020 may look more like Hillary Clinton’s 2008 than her 2016.

Ben: Pete Buttigieg has long been quite strong in Iowa polling, and a new survey out today continues that trend — according to USA Today/Suffolk, he’s within striking distance of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, with 13 percent, five points from Biden’s lead, though 29 percent of caucusgoers say they’re undecided. With the likelihood that he’ll do well — maybe very well — in Iowa growing, but with his lack of traction among black voters showing few signs of improving, does he have a legitimate path to winning the Democratic nomination?

Ed: Yeah, though it’s a narrow one with a lot of factors beyond his control.

Sarah: I’m not willing to discount him completely, but while it’s possible that he has a path, realistically it’s a difficult one.

Ed: The path I discern involves Biden beginning to struggle (which we’ve all been waiting for throughout the invisible primary season) at the same time Buttigieg is killing off all those other Biden-alternative candidacies in Iowa. The latter looks entirely possible; not sure Beto, Booker, Harris, or Klobuchar are going to get out of Iowa alive. If Biden really declines quickly, you could have a weird Buttigieg-Warren-Sanders fight pretty early, and none of them exactly has a corner on minority voters (though Bernie’s doing better this year than he did early on in 2016). I’d put my money on Warren in that scenario, but Pete would have a chance.

Ben: Buttigieg is clearly trying to position himself as the moderate alternative to Biden, as Ed said. At the last debate, he was aggressive in his criticism of Elizabeth Warren’s fuzziness on how to pay for Medicare for All. In the process, he seems to have turned off some progressives, who were already suspicious of him. A report today that Mark Zuckerberg gave him recommendations on political hires has only furthered the impression on the left that he can’t be trusted to tackle the issues they care about. Buttigieg seems to be betting that he does not need this bloc of voters in his corner — is that a good bet from a political standpoint?

Sarah: He needs them to win the primary, at least, so no, I don’t think it’s a good bet. I also think it’s important to understand exactly why left voters object to his closeness with Zuckerberg — it’s not all due to their belief that Facebook is a monopoly that should be broken up. It’s business as usual. People who wouldn’t call themselves socialists or even liberals are tired of it. Buttigieg is close to CEOs right when public opinion seems to have shifted firmly against corporate America and in favor of policies like a wealth tax, which target executives like Zuckerberg. It’s potentially a weakness for him with the very working-class voters he says the Democratic Party needs to recruit

Ed: Yeah, I don’t really understand why Pete would want to associate himself with Zuckerberg, and if I were him, I’d try to be the Non-Corporate Moderate in the race. He can raise money without relying on Wall Street and Silicon Valley. I’ve even been willing to argue that to some extent Buttigieg might be able to pull off a sort of centrism-plus-identity appeal like the last two Democratic presidential nominees, though obviously, there aren’t as many LGBTQ Democratic primary voters as there are feminists or African-Americans. But this is a bad moment to be Mr. Wall Street.

Ben: One thing that has distinguished his candidacy, though — especially considering what a long shot he was at the start — is how much money he’s brought in. He’s got an impressive campaign war chest, with a lot of money coming from small donors, but a lot also coming from the kind of corporate interests Warren and Bernie Sanders have shunned. The cash has allowed him to mount a major campaign apparatus in Iowa, including running TV ads, and it seems to be making a mark. Do voters who like his articulateness and what they see as pragmatism care so much about this aspect of the campaign that shutting off the spigot to Silicon Valley and Wall Street would be worth it?

Sarah: Maybe not in Iowa, but elsewhere, maybe? I think we put too much stock in Iowa, generally.

Ben: It is true that there’s quite a history of people winning it, then not going on to sustain the momentum.

Sarah: All I’d say is that Clinton’s own identity-plus-centrism appeal to voters did not work out well for her in the general, and I think it’s fair to blame that failure in part on the public’s perception of her as a moneyed elitist.

Ed: You may be right, but we will all argue until the end of time about which of Clinton’s problems was most important. And look, I am about as credentialed a career centrist as anyone you will meet, but while I don’t think it has any general-election magic associated with it any more, you can make a good case that Democratic primary voters still feel that way.

As for Iowa, as I noted earlier, its influence depends on who does and doesn’t survive it.

It very nearly knocked HRC right out of the 2008 race; if she hadn’t pulled off the NH upset five days later, it would have.

Ben: One thing we haven’t heard much about Buttigieg is his suitability in a general election. Biden’s perceived strength against Trump is one of his campaign’s central planks, and Sanders and Warren have arguments on their side, too — that they’ll spur enthusiasm among the young and/or among people who are usually not that politically engaged. Does Buttigieg have a particular electability argument one way or the other? He is very young and also gay, which would be a first for a presidential nominee. Do you have any sense of how those factors would play out if he were to win?

Sarah: It’s really hard to say. I’m sure he’s banking on centrism as a way to win over white working-class voters, but again, that didn’t work out for Clinton, and I don’t think it will necessarily work out for anyone else.

Ed: I certainly don’t have the imagination to quite envision a general-election contest between someone as articulate as Buttigieg and the troglodyte in the White House.

I do worry that despite all the “Trump proves you don’t need a resume” talk, Pete’s tenure as mayor of a small city is a problem, particularly since about all we know of it is his struggle with police-minority relations.

One small asset Buttigieg has in a general election — and it could be more important in the primaries — is that he’s a voice for religiously observant, white mainline Protestants, who, ironically, given their cultural dominance for much of American history, have all but vanished from public discourse in the battle between Evangelicals and the religiously unaffiliated.

Sarah: So was Clinton, arguably.

Ed: She hardly ever talked about it, though, much like Warren, who has a similar background. Pete does talk about it, a lot. Again, I wouldn’t overestimate this as an asset for Buttigieg, but it’s real.

Ben: Given his polling, fundraising, and attention surge, would you still call him a long shot at this point?

Sarah: Yeah, I do think that’s fair to say. I think he’s really running to be vice-president at this point.

Ed: You know, that was probably true earlier, and may be true again soon enough, but he does have an opening right now if he’s both skillful and very lucky. The key variable remains Biden. A lot of us fear Uncle Joe won’t fully exhibit the weakness we perceive in him until he’s the nominee."

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) campaigns in Des Moines on Saturday. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)

DES MOINES — Near the end of her stump speech, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asks Iowa Democrats to remember one of the best moments of their lives: the cold January night when they started Barack Obama's march toward the presidency. She was there, too, going door-to-door for Obama, canvassing for Democrats who didn't usually show up and caucus. And a conversation with one elderly black woman had stuck with her.

“She looked at me with a straight face and no expression,” Harris recalled at a Saturday afternoon block party in a heavily black part of Des Moines. “And she said: 'They're not going to let him win.' And I stepped back in my mind, and I looked at what I was looking at. Which was, over the course of at least 85 years, all the indignities, all the injustices, that she has experienced and witnessed. At that age of life, she wasn't about to go through experiencing another disappointment or indignity. And so I decided: Well, I am not leaving.”

The story ends with that elderly Democrat caucusing for Obama. Harris, who has built a formidable Iowa operation despite a tumble in local and national polls, urges the crowd to consider how it would feel to pull another upset and make more history — in so many words, not to choose a candidate they find less inspiring because they're scared.

Harris's hurdle is that there are so many candidates with the same pitch. Five other Democrats — South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, business executive Andrew Yang and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke — have built credible Iowa ground games and raised enough money to compete through February.

All are well liked by potential Democratic caucusgoers; most get name-checked when voters rattle off their “lists,” their mental rundowns of who they've decided to take seriously. (Polling has found Democrats to be more skeptical than Republicans of candidates without experience in elected office, which has hurt Yang.) And all are circling the state with trapeze nets, waiting for voters to see some flaws in former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and jump.

“I'm really frustrated that age has not been more of an issue in this campaign,” said Sarah Small, 28, who came to Harris's event wearing the T-shirt the candidate began selling after confronting Biden on busing. “The top three people in the polls are all, as you know, septuagenarians. And I think it needs to be a conversation about that. Health needs to be a conversation. Bernie Sanders is having a heart attack on the campaign trail. What's going to happen if he's elected and dealing with a national security crisis?”

Sanders's health scare, which canceled any early October plans for the candidate to come to Iowa, is one of very few story lines that has broken through to Iowa Democrats. (The campaign sent surrogates to campaign in the state this month, and Sanders appeared at a Sunday labor forum in Altoona via video.) But the middle-of-the-pack Democrats, who've watched attacks on Biden, Warren and Sanders backfire against the candidates who made them, prefer to talk in circles about the candidates in the lead. At a Saturday night rally at a Des Moines high school, Buttigieg emphasized how young he'd be if he “retired” from the presidency — if he won next year and served two terms, he'd leave at age 47. Afterward, he told reporters that he was not making a point about the three candidates in their 70s.

“Different people are different,” Buttigieg said. “What this election is about is vision, and I've got a vision that's different than all of my competitors.”

For the past two months, in an average of polls, the Warren-Biden-Sanders troika has been bunched up in the lead. In the Des Moines Register's Iowa polls, viewed by campaigns and voters as the state's gold standard, those three have been out front for the entire year; only last year, during a spurt of interest in what he would do after his Senate bid, did Beto O'Rourke crack double digits.

“Still, the six candidates running behind the Biden-Warren-Sanders trio — polling well above zero, but often left out of the party's conversation — have raised more, and built more than many candidates at similar positions ahead of the caucuses. In the third fundraising quarter, Buttigieg raised $19.1 million, Harris raised $11.6 million and Yang raised $10 million — that is more than Joe Biden raised, in total, for the 2008 bid that ended with him becoming vice president. Booker, Klobuchar and O'Rourke all raised more from July through September than they raised the previous three months — $6 million, $4.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Buttigieg has opened 22 Iowa field offices, while O'Rourke has opened 11, Klobuchar has opened 10, Harris has opened nine, and Yang has opened two. Booker, with just one office, has held onto a large organizing staff.

Buttigieg and Harris stand apart in one important way: They made early splashes in Iowa, breaking out of the pack before falling back again. Their split-screen rallies Saturday (Harris wrapped up about two hours before Buttigieg started a few suburbs away) captured their position, neither surging nor falling, with voters who could be heard discussing whether someone else would win the nomination.

At Buttigieg's rally, where around 700 people huddled for warmth outside Roosevelt High School, Mike Alowitz and Scott McCormick compared the candidates they'd ruled out (Marianne Williamson, Tulsi Gabbard) with their shortlist of who could win. McCormack assumed that Warren was the likeliest winner but wanted to keep Buttigieg in the mix because he found him so compelling.

“He's straightforward,” said McCormick, 75, who had caucused for Sanders in 2016 and attended one of Buttigieg's first Iowa house parties in 2019. “He's not straight, but he's straightforward.”

“He was the first candidate to move in my tier, from 'no' to 'maybe,' “ said Alowitz, 42. “I'd just prefer some D.C. experience. You need to know how to work the system.”

Buttigieg's rallies, with optimistic stump speeches and questions that usually fit in his wheelhouse (How will you respond to personal attacks? Should we eliminate the electoral college?), showcase his made-for-TV ability to concisely answer questions. As he and Harris urge voters to look past the “front-runners,” the Buttigieg strategy involves asking voters again and again to imagine their candidate dismantling Trump with logic.

“What we're seeing is a fast-unfolding process that betrays the core strength of America, which is that we're a country that had been perceived as a country that could be counted on, to our allies and our adversaries,” Buttigieg said when asked, even before the president ordered a full troop withdrawal, by reporters about the Trump administration standing down in Syria. “When that happens, there is a terrible price to be paid. And it makes America less safe. By the way, we're also seeing ISIS fighters freed, so this is also undermining our own interests.”

Harris's “electability' approach is more direct, calling out “the donkey in the room” and saying she may have slipped out of the headlines because, once again, a nonwhite candidate is being underrated. Her Saturday event, which featured free barbecue and a DJ playing “Cupid Shuffle,” drew out a few hundred voters, including dozens of African Americans — a contrast with Buttigieg. And she talks much more about her record than Buttigieg, describing “the Dark Ages” of anti-crime hysteria when she was elected San Francisco's district attorney (critics said she should be “locking people up” if she wanted to win again) and her six years as California's attorney general (“When I took on the five big banks of the United States, people said to me, calmly, your career will be over.”)

But both candidates are asked to respond to events that aren't shaped by Democratic candidates — much less the candidates looking for a foothold while polling at single digits. Like Buttigieg, Harris was prompted to talk about the president's moves in Syria. Her answer ended in a similar place, but took a longer journey there.

“It is, yet again, another display of Donald Trump's inability to understand the role and the responsibilities of commander in chief, which includes standing with our allies, which includes standing with our friends, which includes standing with those who have stood with us when we have been in time of need,” Harris said. “And the result of what he has done is, predictably, that Kurds, we are seeing, are being open to slaughter. Also, there is, predictably, what is happening, which is an abandonment to some extent of what they have otherwise been doing, in terms of overseeing ISIS detainees and their families. And this is, yet again, another display of Donald Trump's unilateral actions, based on unknown motivations, but clearly not being motivated by America's national security and our interests in terms of maintaining our security through the relationships that we have around the globe.”

On Sunday, both candidates would address labor organizers, joined by Joe Biden, but not by Warren. And both Buttigieg and Harris would be back in Iowa on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the debate is over — both of them putting the state at the center of their primary strategy, both of them with three or four candidates to climb past first.

TURNOUT WATCH

Louisiana's all-party primary Saturday saw the highest voter turnout for a state legislative election since 2003, when Democrats still dominated the state. Yesterday's election put an end to that dominance, as the rural surge toward Republicans that has happened in state after state finally came to southwest and northeast Louisiana, flipping a number of state House and Senate seats. Gov. John Bel Edwards, one of just two Democratic governors in the South, was forced into a November runoff — despite winning more first-round votes than any Democratic candidate for governor in 36 years.

It's simple: Louisiana holds a “jungle primary,” in which every party's candidates compete, and a runoff, in which the top two finishers face off if no one got 50 percent of the vote. From 2015 to 2019, statewide primary turnout jumped from 1,114,336 votes to 1,343,478 votes. Edwards won 626,000 votes, which in other years would have been enough for a first-round victory. But Republicans Eddie Rispone and Ralph Abraham got a combined 685,433 votes; four years ago, the credible Republican candidates running against Edwards got a combined 637,938 votes.

The president immediately took credit for the turnout, tweeting incorrectly that Edwards had been polling at 66 percent until a “Keep America Great” rally in Lake Charles, La., this week. (Polling had put Edwards in the high 40s, with a few outliers putting him above 50 percent.) But the higher GOP activation was clear a week ago, when early voting ended; for only the second time in Louisiana history, self-identified Republicans had made up more than 40 percent of the early vote.

Republicans had two missions, paid for by normal party operations and by a conservative PAC run by Attorney General Jeff Landry and Sen. Bill Cassidy. One: Drive up the GOP vote in rural Louisiana to finally flip state legislative districts that had been won by Trump but held for ages by Democrats. Two: Force Edwards into a runoff, a position no incumbent Democrat has been able to win from in 17 years. (In 2002, Sen. Mary Landrieu narrowly beat a Republican challenger, in a state that up to that point had never elected a Republican to the Senate.)

The GOP succeeded at both tasks. There will be a runoff, and whoever wins it will face a Republican supermajority in the state Senate and a potential supermajority in the state House. Edwards ran far ahead of his ticket — no other Democrat on the statewide ballot cleared 40 percent — but as election analyst Ryan Matsumoto pointed out, Edwards trailed his 2015 numbers in all but two parishes, Orleans and Jefferson. That's the city of New Orleans and its suburbs, respectively, and those suburbs used to be far more conservative.

If there's a surprise, it is that Edwards, an antiabortion moderate who signed a restrictive “heartbeat” abortion bill, did so much better with suburban voters while gaining so little with rural whites. The Democrat actually won Calcasieu Parish, where the president campaigned Friday. But while he won the 2015 two-party vote there by 17 points, he lost it by 12 points to Rispone and Abraham yesterday. In 2015, Edwards cleared 40 percent of the vote in the parishes of southwest Louisiana; on Saturday, he fell below 30 percent in most of them, often running in third place behind the Republicans.

Democratic consultants, in a lab, could not come up with a candidate as perfect for rural voters as Edwards — a U.S. Military Academy graduate and veteran who signed legislation making it a hate crime to attack a police officer. And that candidate is following the same electoral path as every other Democrat: strengthening in urban and suburban areas and losing traction elsewhere.

AD WATCH

Donald Trump, “Facts.” The president's well-funded reelection campaign keeps adding to a buy that Joe Biden's campaign has accurately called out for furthering falsehoods. In the latest spot, the campaign uses a 2018 clip of Biden talking about pressure on Ukraine's former president — pressure that helped get him to fire a prosecutor opposed by international observers — to insist that Democrats are covering up Biden's corruption. “Donald Trump won, but Democrats want to overturn the election,” says a narrator, repeating the red-meat theme of these ads: Any attacks on the president are sour grapes and probably false.

Pete Buttigieg, “Recruit.” The South Bend., Ind., mayor continues to portray himself as the sensible get-stuff-done candidate, a contrast with more ambitious or dreamy candidates who shall not be named. ""Climate change is too important for us to allow it to keep being a divisive and partisan issue,"" he says. ""Instead of beating up some Americans over this issue, I want to recruit them as part of a new clean-energy economy."" Who's beating them up? The unspoken bullies are people who attack climate ""deniers."" The policy, and even how it's described, mirrors the rhetoric around the ""Green New Deal.""

Tom Steyer, “Real economic power.” The billionaire investor has run more Iowa ads than anyone, continuing to tell his life story in 30-second chunks. The latest of his spots (he has rolled out two this week) describes his founding of a “nonprofit community bank” that funded start-ups for “women and people of color.” His point: “The difference between words and action matter.”

POLL WATCH

Will this candidate handle President Trump's attacks very well? (CBS News/YouGov battleground poll, 16,500 registered voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 65%

Bernie Sanders — 60%

Joe Biden — 50%

The latest CBS News look at the early states is largely good for Warren, who has gained in the ballot test since last month and who is more decisively seen as electable. Asked whether Warren would beat Trump, 56 percent of Democrats say she would — up from 39 percent in June. Even more telling of Warren's position is the confidence Democrats have about who could handle attacks from Trump. By a small margin, Democrats say that Trump's impeachment-prompting attacks on Biden's son, Hunter, have made them more sympathetic toward Biden, but by a 15-point margin they say Warren is readier to handle the president.

That's a sea change from six or even three months ago, when the conventional wisdom was that the president, who had goaded Warren into taking a DNA test, would pummel her out of contention by calling her “Pocahontas.” The president has continued to refer to the senator from Massachusetts with that nickname, which he appropriated from anti-Warren conservative media in Massachusetts. But it no longer shapes coverage about her.

IN THE STATES

Illinois. Republicans lost one of their early recruits in the race for the House when former lieutenant governor Evelyn Sanguinetti dropped out of the race for Illinois's 6th District. The suburban Chicago-area 6th, originally drawn to be safe for Republicans, backed Mitt Romney in 2012 by 8.2 points, supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 7 points, and elected Democratic Rep. Sean Casten last year by 7.2 points. But Sanguinetti was wildly out-fundraised by Casten and said while quitting the race that she did not want to suffer the “destruction” of a primary against conservative Jeanne Ives. The state has one of the country's earliest primaries, in March; the filing deadline to enter it is six weeks away.

Maine. Former state legislator Dale Crafts jumped into the Republican primary to challenge Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, one of the 2018 Democrats who flipped a Republican-trending seat; the rural 2nd District backed Barack Obama in 2012 by 8.6 points, then backed Trump by 10.3 points. Eric Brakey, a libertarian-leaning state senator, was already in the race; Crafts arrived with the support of former Republican governor Paul LePage and pledged to run as a partner with Trump.

2020

Joe Biden. After an appearance at the United Food and Commercial Workers meeting in Altoona, Iowa, Biden said he would enforce new ethics standards if he became president.

“If I am your president, the next president, I'm going to build on the squeaky-clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House,” he said. “And no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period. End of story.”

He joined four other Democrats at Sunday’s meeting in Altoona, Iowa, laying out a series of reforms to restore labor and voting rights policies that had been killed by executive action or courts, such as “pre-clearance” before states pass new voting laws.

Bernie Sanders. He scheduled a “Bernie's back” rally for Oct. 20, in New York City; he also conducted more interviews about his health and his campaign in the wake of his heart attack. In a talk with ABC News, he was more game than usual to draw a contrast with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ""[She] considers herself — if I got the quote correctly — to be a capitalist to her bones,” he said. “I don't. And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

Elizabeth Warren. She bought a Facebook ad falsely “reporting” that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was supporting Donald Trump, to raise attention to the platform’s willingness to run with ads that include untrue claims. When Facebook’s PR responded, she pushed back on Twitter: “It’s up to you whether you take money to promote lies.”

Tulsi Gabbard. In a Facebook Live video, she unloaded on the president and “warmongers” over the abandonment of the Kurds. “The Kurds are just another casualty of this regime change war which is supported by warmongering Republicans, Democrats and the corporate media,” she said. “The hypocrisy of warmongers like Nikki Haley, Senator Graham and others who have demanded that we continue our regime change war in Syria, who are now crying crocodile tears for the Kurds, is nauseating.”

Joe Sestak. He has begun his walk across New Hampshire, posting frequent updates on Twitter and leaving a stake in the ground (pounded in by a baseball bat) when he needs to temporarily stop and divert to talk to voters.

Steve Bullock. Before addressing the UFCW meeting, he chastised the media for asking candidates to respond to the president’s campaign ads. “I’m not even going to play that game,” he said. “Should we have criticism of hiring your own family members like Jared and Ivanka?”

Andrew Yang. He told reporters in Epping, N.H., that he’ll have another surprise on debate night; last time, it was a national contest for families to get their own $1,000 monthly basic income.

Amy Klobuchar. She got a sympathetic interview on “Real Time with Bill Maher,” and a forum to reiterate why she didn’t think more left-wing candidates could win. “I want to win big, and if someone is looking to kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years, then I’m not your candidate.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

The CNN-hosted “Equality in America” town halls offered some bold color illustrations of how much Democrats have moved on LGBTQ rights. The first forum like it, 12 years ago, had the party's three front-runners explaining why they didn't support same-sex marriage.

“We should try to disentangle what has historically been the issue of the word 'marriage,' which has religious connotations to some people, from the civil rights that are given couples,” said Barack Obama, who wouldn't endorse marriage equality for five more years.

Thursday's forum was something completely different, with the same-sex marriage question completely settled. All nine Democrats who qualified and attended [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) skipped, as he recuperated from his heart attack] had endorsed the Equality Act, which would codify LGBTQ protections that are protected by courts and executive decisions. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the most moderate of the candidates onstage, was pressured on her support for SESTA-FOSTA, the anti-sex-trafficking bill that passed by a landslide, to the horror of sex workers who have chosen that profession.

“Let's see how we can find some common ground going forward,” Klobuchar said, shortly before agreeing to add a third gender option to federal forms.

The forum was a major success for LGBTQ activists, and the discussion afterward has been largely about whether Democrats damaged themselves. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tied her support for same-sex marriage to a song about tolerance she'd learned in Sunday school, but she also joked about shutting down any voter who told her that he believed marriage was between “one man and one woman.”

“I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that,' "" Warren said. She waited, then delivered the punchline: “Assuming you can find one.”

In the room, full of activists and members of the co-sponsoring Human Rights Campaign, the line killed; as The Post's Annie Linskey would report, it also rattled Democrats and conservatives who worried that Warren was too glib about a religious issue. But opposition to same-sex marriage has become a relatively fringe position in swing states.

According to a 2017 study by the Public Religion Research Institute, a supermajority of voters in 2016's key states support same-sex marriage: 63 percent in Michigan, 64 percent in Pennsylvania and 66 percent in Wisconsin. In just two states, Alabama and Mississippi, did opposition to same-sex marriage outrun support for it.

By 2016, the issue was so politically neutered that exit pollsters did not ask about it. The Republicans' campaign presented Donald Trump as a pro-gay-rights candidate, soft-pedaling his pledge to appoint conservative judges who opposed marriage rights. By this year, 61 percent of Catholics and 66 percent of Protestants backed same-sex marriage rights. Just 29 percent of white evangelical Protestants, the largest conservative religious demographic, agreed with that position. But per the 2016 exit poll, just 16 percent of those voters backed Hillary Clinton for president; 20 percent had voted for Obama in 2012.

There was no clear general election downside to Warren's joke. But there probably was to Beto O'Rourke's game answer when asked whether religious institutions should lose tax-exempt status if they don't grant full LGBTQ equality. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,” O'Rourke said.

Polling on that idea doesn't demonstrate the political danger of this; the idea is so unorthodox that it's rarely polled. Six years ago, the center-left Third Way think tank asked voters whether churches that opposed same-sex marriage should be compelled to perform weddings, and just 28 percent of voters said they should. While Warren's joke put her on comfortable political turf, polling-wise, O'Rourke's put him on Republican turf and confused the only gay candidate in the race. During a Saturday speech to the Values Voter Summit in Washington, the president ignored Warren's joke but condemned O'Rourke for threatening to “use the IRS as a political weapon” against Christians.

“I'm not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying,” Pete Buttigieg said on CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday morning. “I mean, that means going to war, not only with churches, but I would think with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles that I do, but also, because of the separation of church and state, are acknowledged as nonprofits in this country. So, if we want to talk about anti-discrimination law for a school or an organization, absolutely, they should not be able to discriminate.”

But O'Rourke, by Sunday, had already cleaned up the remark. “Anyone can believe what they want — but organizations that discriminate when they provide public services should not be tax-exempt,” he tweeted.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took a decent-size lead over former vice president Joe Biden after surging into a tie in September.

What’s particularly interesting, though, is how that lead came about.

According to CBS’s Kabir Khanna, a quarter of Democratic likely voters changed the candidate they identified as their first pick over the past month. Warren was the biggest beneficiary of those changes, slicing away one-eighth of supporters from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), about the same percentage of support from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and more than a fifth of those who’d previously backed Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). At the same time, Warren held more of her support than did any other candidate.

We can visualize the flow between the candidates like this.

The dark blue sections represent the density of support in September that stuck with the same candidate (or in the case of the group at the bottom, the collective “everyone else” pool of candidates). The lines connecting two candidates indicate how much support moved back and forth as a percentage of each candidate’s September total.

AD

AD

The best way to explain that latter movement is to look at Warren’s support vs. that of former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke. Nine percent of O’Rourke’s support in September moved to Warren. None of Warren’s moved to O’Rourke. So the line connecting them is relatively wide on O’Rourke’s end — and a point on Warren’s. The same effect exists between Biden and Warren. The line is wider on Biden’s end (he lost 8 percent of his support to her) than on hers (she lost 4 percent to him). The overall picture for Warren, though, reflects something that FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver wrote Monday: Warren has benefited from winning support from a number of other candidates, not really — and even not especially — from Biden.

Now look at Sanders’s support. The lines connecting his circle to Biden’s and Warren’s both taper off as they reach the other candidates; he lost more support to each of them than he gained as percentages of where each was in September. Also important: Sanders kept less of his support than Warren or Biden, though still more than Harris. (That 22 percent shift from Harris to Warren was met with a 2 percent shift from Warren back to Harris.)

Of those whose first choice in the primaries or caucuses was one of the unnamed candidates, nearly half moved somewhere else. Warren and Biden were the two biggest beneficiaries. Very little support moved from the candidates identified on the chart back to the pool of other candidates.

What’s remarkable about these data, though, is the fluidity of it. For all of the tracking of voter choices and the broad trends we can observe (like Warren’s improvement over time), many voters are still not firmly committed to particular candidates. Left to their devices, plenty of voters will still happily select “undecided” as their first choice.

It’s worth reiterating the important corollary to that point about fluidity, though: No candidate proved better at not losing support over the past month in these early states than Warren.

SAN DIEGO — Three years ago, Kamala Harris won a Senate seat from California in a 24-point rout. More than 7.5 million voters, most of them Democrats, backed her candidacy.

But at the moment, not many of them are interested in supporting her for president.

“I find her message much less clear,” said Beth Malikowski, 58, who wore a 2016 Hillary Clinton T-shirt to Elizabeth Warren's Thursday night town hall here. “I'd love to watch her mop the floor with Trump, but I didn't know much about her until she ran for president.”

“She's not known around here,” said William Pierce, 70. “I have a thing against her, because we can't get an answer from her about the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant.”

“I don't like her,” said Cindy Mohr, 58. “I saw a clip of her in San Francisco, talking about dealing with kids dropping out of school or playing hooky, and smirking as she said she was going to put their parents in jail.”

Five months out from California's primary, just four months before the first ballots go out in the mail, Harris has fallen to the middle of the pack in a state where she has won three big, expensive races. A run of early endorsements, including one from Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), has not translated to popular support. Democratic nervousness about the candidates dominating their primary — former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — has not translated into support for any candidate in the middle of the pack.

The candidate most obviously struggling in that arrangement is Harris, for whom a potential advantage — a delegate-rich early primary in her home state — has yet to pan out. This week, as the senator appeared on the cover of Time magazine, a new poll from the Public Policy Institute found just 8 percent of California Democrats supporting her run for president.

“I do not rise and fall with poll numbers,” Harris told reporters at the SEIU's “Unions for All” forum this week. “What we are seeing when we go to these early states is a great amount of enthusiasm. We're building up as we always intended to do.”

After a spectacular start, a rally in her hometown of Oakland that remains the largest single gathering for any 2020 Democrat, Harris has slipped behind in California for the same reasons she's struggled nationally. Other campaigns plunged into the state and organized early; other candidates proved more compelling to Democratic and labor groups. Liberal voters who pay close attention to the primary were deluged with early, negative stories about Harris's time as San Francisco district attorney; other voters often didn't realize she was their senator.

“Harris isn't the 'favorite daughter' candidate, but that's not unusual, because she's not well known,” said Rose Kapolczynski, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped elect Harris's predecessor, Barbara Boxer. “Five years into [Boxer's] first term, one-third of voters said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion. And she was a pretty high-profile, aggressive senator.” Voters were probably not even aware of the Newsom endorsement, she added; it was, at best, a one-day story.

Harris's campaign remains well organized in California and dominates other candidates with local endorsements — at least 150 of them, from left-wing icon Rep. Barbara Lee to Blue Dog Democratic Rep. Jim Costa. The campaign has 11 staff working in the state and says that at least 3,000 volunteers “have been trained to be community organizers through Camp Kamala,” its organizing school.

The campaign is clear-eyed about its problems, suggesting that the California picture, and every other primary, would shift if the senator did well in Iowa. But some donors who had high hopes for Harris have started to play out a primary where the senator lags behind.

“She’s built a really strong base of fans in California, and I think she’ll retain that, either in this race or in the future,” Donna Bojarsky, a Democratic strategist who attended a Harris fundraiser last week, said in an email. “We do see more people now pondering out loud how/if Elizabeth Warren could broaden her base in a general election. That has definitively shifted in the last few weeks.”

Warren has become a bigger part of the conversation for two reasons — a series of rallies where she has drawn out thousands of Californians and a strong appearances at the sort of forums where Harris has struggled. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents around 15,000 California nurses, endorsed Harris in her 2016 Senate race; last month, its members voted to support Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. (The senator from Vermont had won the union's 2016 presidential endorsement outright.)

There are even more votes at play with the California SEIU, which does not make its own endorsement but has a role in the national endorsement and was a major presence at a “Unions for All” forum. Bob Schoonover, the president of the California SEIU, complimented Harris's focus on sector-wide organizing — one of the union's major priorities — while praising the “personal connection” Joe Biden had with the audience and Warren's ability to explain labor's goals.

“Do we have a really good relationship with Sen. Harris? Absolutely,” Schoonover said. “We made a real difference in her 2010 election for attorney general. We are probably closer to her than any other candidate. But Joe Biden's been around forever; Elizabeth Warren's been around a really long time. So has Bernie Sanders. You have to get a longer look at people than we've had so far.”

Warren and Sanders, in particular, have also been building out their California campaigns. The Sanders campaign said that 730,000 Californians have taken some sort of action on its behalf, from donations to house parties; over the weekend, when the candidate's health scare kept him in Las Vegas, pre-scheduled campaign events and office openings went forward with mariachi bands instead of Sanders. Warren's campaign has held five “barnstorming” events in major cities, similar to the Sanders campaign, to sign up and train supporters.

There has been less grass-roots organizing so far for Tom Steyer, the other Californian in the race, and the last candidate to enter it. Most of the appearances by Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been in front of donors. But that donor interest is a function of Democrats' interest in their non-Harris alternatives. After his own “Unions for All” appearance, Buttigieg, who had drawn a large crowd to a rally in Sacramento, played down the idea that home-state candidates had the advantage in California.

“One of the things I've found from the fantastic reception we've got in different California communities is it feels like the voters of the state are very open-minded,” Buttigieg said. “As far as I can tell, California is wide open. And we're going to continue appearing here, not just in the biggest cities, but also we really enjoyed visiting different kinds of communities like Fresno, which in some ways reminds me of my hometown of South Bend.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

LOS ANGELES — Joe Biden remains the biggest obstacle in the path of every other Democratic candidate for president. Even his donors are growing nervous about the attacks on him, asking whether the time it took for him to respond to President Trump — and an effort to keep focused on Biden's policy agenda, steering away from “distraction” — hints at any general election weakness.

Meanwhile, Biden's presidential rivals keep declining to pile on. Elizabeth Warren initially hesitated when asked whether her ethics plan would prevent a Hunter Biden-style situation: a member of a vice president's family getting a job with a foreign company. Since then, she has refused to engage on the question, pivoting back to Trump. And at the SEIU's two-day candidate forum here, most Democrats again refused to take a swing at Biden.

“Leave Joe Biden alone,” said Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), repeating her refrain from the last two weeks of Biden coverage.

“There won't be any confusion about the ethical expectations that I will have for my White House,” South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said when he faced the same question. “But specifically with regards to this question, I also think it is not a good idea for us to get sucked into commenting on one of our fellow Democratic competitors when the real story here is the president of the United States confessing on air to the abuse of power, and we cannot allow him to change the subject.”

A little discord came from former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has swung back and forth in his approach to Biden, from demanding he answer for certain key votes to saying Democrats should not attack one another. In California, he was alone in suggesting that a strong ethics plan would prevent the sort of situation now being mined for attack material by Trump.

“I can't totally follow all the twists of that,” O'Rourke said when asked about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine. “I would not allow a family member, anyone in my Cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.”

But as the president continues to make incorrect assertions about Biden, no Democrat has defended the story at the center: Hunter Biden's career. Last week, in a CNN interview, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said flatly that people in the younger Biden's position shouldn't take questionable jobs.

“I have a lot of beliefs about ethics rules and the needs for our government of the United States to go far further in the rules that we have,” he began. “I just don’t think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who appeared on CNN today, went down the same path. Asked whether she would have let any presidential or vice presidential offspring take a job with a foreign company, she said she wouldn't have.

“I can promise you right now, my own daughter, who's only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,” Klobuchar said. “But that is not the issue. The issue here is what the president is doing, because we have the Ukrainian prosecutors saying that there's no evidence. There has — as you have said on your show, multiple people looking at this — that there's no evidence that the vice president did something wrong here.”

Remarkably, no Democrat has tried to twist the issue back to the president himself — a president who has involved his children more closely in campaigning and governing than any modern predecessor, while putting no limitations on their ability to conduct business, in the United States or overseas.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

All three races for governor this year, in Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi, will be held in states that voted overwhelmingly to put Donald Trump in the White House. All three are more competitive than the 2016 results might suggest, with Democrats reaching out to Republican voters and focusing on health care — exactly what national Democrats want the next year to be about.

The result? While even some swing-district Democrats have endorsed the impeachment inquiry, the red-state Democrats running for governor have mostly declined to talk about it — much less to endorse it. In Mississippi, Attorney General Jim Hood has sounded a bit like Republicans, describing anything happening between the president and Democratic leaders as noise.

“I'm focused on our race for governor and on the local issues affecting Mississippi such as education, roads and bridges, and healthcare,” Hood said in a statement last month. “All of the craziness and gridlock in Washington has created a positive response here in Mississippi where moderates in both parties are coming together to move our state forward.”

In Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin tried to inject impeachment into the race by holding a news conference, where he reiterated that he opposed impeachment (“it's destroying this nation”) while his opponent, Attorney General Andy Beshear, would not take a position.

“As Kentucky’s top prosecutor, I make my decisions based on facts and evidence. And all I have right now are news stories,” Beshear said in an interview with Kentucky reporters. “My hope, if they choose to proceed, is that they set it up in a nonpartisan way that is focused on getting to the truth and evidence, and not scoring political points.”

Louisiana's John Bel Edwards, the only incumbent Democratic governor on the ballot this year, took a similar approach. Impeachment has not even come up in televised debates so far.

But Democrats were taken aback at the way the president tweeted about the race, urging voters to pick any Republican in the Oct. 12 primary and labeling Edwards a “Nancy Pelosi/Chuck Schumer Democrat.” Up to now, Republicans had preferred to tie Edwards to Hillary Clinton or one of the 2020 presidential candidates; the impeachment inquiry had convinced Republicans that the Democrats in Washington made better foils. And on Sunday, the president announced an Oct. 11 rally in Louisiana, the day before the primary, nationalizing a race that Republicans had struggled to turn into a Trump referendum.

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

TURNOUT WATCH

Early voting has wrapped up in Louisiana's gubernatorial primary; in-person voting for the primary is still six days away. And the first batch of numbers looked better for the Republicans in the race than it did for Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.

Overall, 374,190 ballots were cast in the early vote, up nearly 50 percent from the early vote in 2015. In that race, a moderate Republican was challenging Edwards and the GOP front-runner, David Vitter; this year, two other Republicans are challenging Edwards, and the result has been a boost in party turnout. As first reported by pollster John Couvillon, registered Democrats had a 14-point advantage in the early vote four years ago. This year, the Democratic advantage shrank to a single point.

Edwards's campaign suggested that the black early vote, which jumped on the final day, was a positive sign — one in four early voters was black, down just marginally from 2015. But Republicans were much happier, with David Weinman, a spokesman for GOP candidate Ralph Abraham, calling the turnout “historic.” And it came while Edwards and an allied super PAC dominated early TV advertising, before Republicans tapped the president to try to nationalize the race. Trump tweeted Sunday that he is going to Louisiana on Friday for a rally, aiming to deny Edwards a majority of the vote. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff.

AD WATCH

Joe Biden, “Unhinged.” The former vice president's campaign had been running “general election” ads before this week, with messaging and policy proposals designed as much for independents as for the activists who might actually caucus in Iowa. This spot attacks Trump directly but is aimed more at Democratic primary voters, warning them that the president thinks his tactics “will allow him to pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat.”

The campaign is spending $6 million to put the ad on TV and digital platforms, by far the biggest buy by any Democrat not named Tom Steyer. It's also relying quite a bit on earned media, which the Biden speech quoted in this spot did not dominate — he delivered it at night in Reno, on Pacific time, missing many of that day's news deadlines.

Donald Trump, “Changing Things.” As his party has bounced between a couple of different strategies to fight back on impeachment, Trump has focused on one: blaming Democrats for envy-inspired chaos. “It isn't pretty,” a narrator says. “The swamp hates him. But Mr. Nice Guy won't cut it. It takes a tough guy to change Washington.” Polling hasn't found much support for the message beyond the president's supporters, but it's meant to change the entire discussion around corruption: If a voter is disgusted at Washington, he should trust the president and assume that any accusations against him are false.

POLL WATCH

2020 election in Wisconsin (Fox News, 1,512 voters)

Joe Biden — 48%

Donald Trump — 39%

Bernie Sanders — 45%

Donald Trump — 40%

Elizabeth Warren — 45%

Donald Trump — 41%

This is one of the first polls conducted entirely since the beginning of the Trump-Ukraine saga and the House's impeachment inquiry. It finds two things that cut against Republicans' planning: The president is weak in the swing state that Democrats worry the most about, and attacks on Joe Biden haven't turned many voters away from him.

Every major Democratic candidate leads Trump and runs ahead of Hillary Clinton with key voters; none lose rural voters by 27 points, as Clinton did, and Biden loses them by only two points. By a 22-point margin, voters believe that the Ukraine story is a “serious” liability for Trump; by a one-point margin, voters are comfortable with impeachment, though divided on whether they also want the president removed from office. White voters, who powered Trump's narrow 2016 wins in the Midwest, are cooler on him now. Three years ago, he won 52 percent of their votes in Wisconsin, and he's now at 44 percent with them against Warren, 43 percent against Sanders and 41 percent against Biden.

The Democrats' own primary is a bit more muddled. Biden leads the field with 28 percent to Warren's 22 percent; Sanders, who won the 2016 primary in a landslide, polls at 17 percent. There's much less support for the candidates who have run on Midwestern roots and electability — 7 percent for Pete Buttigieg and 2 percent for Amy Klobuchar.

South Carolina Democratic primary (Fox News, 803 Democrats)

Joe Biden — 41% ( 6)

Elizabeth Warren — 12% ( 7)

Bernie Sanders — 10% (-4)

Kamala Harris — 4% (-8)

Tom Steyer — 4% ( 4)

Cory Booker — 3 ( 0)

Pete Buttigieg — 2 ( 0)

Michael Bennet — 1 ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 1 ( 1)

Tim Ryan — 1 ( 1)

Marianne Williamson — 1 ( 0)

Andrew Yang — 1 ( 0)

The first Southern primary remains, for Biden, a variation on the “firewall” — he leads there handily, but not with the margin that Hillary Clinton won on her way to putting Sanders away. In 2015, Fox's first South Carolina poll was taken in December, and it found Clinton up by 44 points with a 71-point advantage among black voters. Biden leads with black voters by 39 points over Sanders, who gets 9 percent of their support, while Warren gets 8 percent. Overall, 50 percent of South Carolina's black Democrats pick Biden; 30 percent pick another candidate, and the rest are undecided.

That's more than enough to keep Biden ahead of a crowded pack, as no other Democrat has built a powerful constituency here. The former vice president trails with only one group of voters — white voters with college degrees, who back Warren by a 26-to-21 margin over Biden. The continuing weakness of the race's black candidates gives Biden more space here, with Harris, who would be the first black woman president, at just 3 percent with black women.

DEBATE SEASON

The Oct. 15 debate in Ohio will be the last Democratic faceoff under the current rules — qualifying by getting 2 percent in four polls and more than 130,000 donations. The November debate, with no set date yet, will be limited to candidates who reach 3 percent in four national polls, or 5 percent in two polls of early states, all while getting at least 165,000 donations.

As of today, seven candidates have qualified for November's debate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer. The latter two were pushed over the line by new Fox News polling from South Carolina. And that leaves more than half the Democratic field off the stage, with perhaps a month to move things around.

The stragglers fit into two categories. Five of them qualified for the October debate: Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Julián Castro and Tulsi Gabbard. Only one of these candidates, Yang, is close to making November's debate; one more poll would do it for him, as he passed the donation count weeks ago.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital Friday, then headed home to Vermont, with no individual campaign events scheduled. “I'm feeling so much better,” Sanders said. “I just want to thank all of you for the love and warm wishes that you sent to me.”

It’s all but certain that Sanders led the 2020 Democrats in fundraising for the third quarter; he collected $25.3 million, slightly ahead of Elizabeth Warren. Half of their competitors have yet to announce their totals, but none were on track to pass Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, the other Democrats with eight-figure hauls.

Joe Biden. On Friday, he held his first media gaggle since the impeachment inquiry began, unloading on the president as the human ""definition of corruption"" and chastising reporters who wanted him to talk about Hunter Biden's Ukraine work.

Joe Sestak. He'll walk the length of New Hampshire, west to east, from Oct. 13 to 20. (That will put Sestak past Keene on the day of the fourth Democratic debate, for which he did not qualify.) In his past two races, both campaigns for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Sestak walked across a much larger state.

Mark Sanford. In a Sunday interview on CNN, he agreed with an argument from House Republican leaders — that Democrats should hold a real impeachment vote, rather than letting an “inquiry” run through committees. “I don't know that, ultimately, impeachment is the best way to go,” he added. “I think probably censure is, given the fact that we're this close to an election.”

Tulsi Gabbard. She’s campaigning across Iowa on Sunday through Tuesday, with a series of town halls and more intimate coffees.

Steve Bullock. He raised $2.3 million in the third quarter, though he did not release numbers to suggest he would hit the debate thresholds.

Amy Klobuchar. She was in New Hampshire on Sunday to open a Manchester campaign office.

After a three-hour debate that showed sharper divisions in the Democratic field, the candidates were asked a question inspired by the friendship between talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush. Each candidate was asked to speak about a friendship that would be a surprise.

AD

AD

Three, Klobuchar, Sanders and Biden, named the late senator John McCain. Buttigieg said the people he met in the military from different walks of life. Warren said Charles Fried, a solicitor general in the Bush administration, who helped her get a job 27 years ago. She also mentioned her three older brothers whose politics are different from hers.

Harris said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Gabbard said former congressman Trey Gowdy, and O’Rourke recalled driving with Rep. Will Hurd from Texas to Washington and airing the whole thing on Facebook. Booker referenced working with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and his effort to dine with every Republican senator, including Ted Cruz (Tex.).

Gabbard also used the moment to take a veiled shot at Hillary Clinton, saying, “When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans.”

AD

AD

Yang cited a trucker named Fred, an avid supporter of President Trump who he said is now supporting him.

“He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs, and I’m happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we’ve remained in touch ever since,” Yang said.

Warren, Biden face off on CFPB

Biden, situated onstage between liberal champions Sanders and Warren, attempted to distinguish himself as the realist with a résumé of successes.

“I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here. But I'm the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,” Biden said. “The question is who is best prepared. We all have good ideas.”

AD

AD

Warren shot back that she came up with the idea to create a consumer agency to keep big banks in check and that she helped get it passed.

Biden responded that he played a key role in persuading people to support that bill. “I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “So let’s get those things straight too.”

Warren paused before responding, “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed in the law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it. And who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

“Understand this: It was a dream-big fight-hard,” Warren said. “People told me go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept … we have to be willing to make big structural change.”

Candidates address abortion rights

Harris said that if she were elected president, her Justice Department would use “pre-clearance” to fight back against state legislators that pass unconstitutional abortion restrictions, so that those laws would not go into effect. She also recalled questioning Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and asking whether he could think of a law that sought to control only men’s bodies.

“And the answer was ‘Uh, uh, uh, no,’” Harris said. “The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America.”

Several candidates, including Klobuchar and Castro, said they would codify Roe v. Wade. Booker said he would create an office of reproductive freedom in the White House to elevate the issue.

AD

Gabbard said the necessity of “safe, legal and rare” abortions was one of the rare things on which she agreed with Hillary Clinton. However, she said there should be restrictions in place so that abortions were not allowed in the third trimester “unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.”

AD

Warren said she lived through a time in the United States when abortion was illegal and reminded the crowd that people still got abortions — if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal. It was the poor and young who were denied access, she said.

Biden takes stronger stance on justices

Biden has previously taken heat from the Democratic base because he suggested that Republicans would be willing to work with him if he were elected president.

AD

“With Trump gone, you’re going to begin to see things change,” Biden said earlier this year. “Because these folks know better. They know this isn’t what they’re supposed to be doing.”

On the debate stage Tuesday night, he struck a different note, declaring that he would take the same approach to the Supreme Court as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did when he blocked the Senate from considering the nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016.

AD

At the time, McConnell had argued that the successor to the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia should be chosen by whichever president won the November 2016 election.

Biden said Tuesday night that, if one of the current Supreme Court justices steps down, he would make sure as the Democratic nominee that his party “would do exactly what McConnell did last time out: We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.”

AD

Harris wants Warren to join her call to kick Trump off Twitter

In their first notable disagreement of the night, Harris pressed Warren to join her in calling for Trump to be kicked off Twitter, accusing Warren of having a double standard when it comes to holding corporations accountable.

“I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,” Warren responded.

AD

Warren then said the real problem is not whether Twitter will suspend Trump but the amount of corporate money in politics.

“You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,” Warren said.

AD

Harris pivoted back to the corporate accountability issue, arguing that Warren has different standards for different businesses.

“This is a matter of holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people’s perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors, we all have to agree this is their power,” Harris said. “And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.”

“I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don’t have a problem with that,” Warren said, though she didn’t clarify whether she would support Harris’s call to kick Trump off Twitter.

Biden has an answer on his age

Biden had an answer ready when the moderators eventually asked him about his age. He turned the question around, emphasizing the experience and wisdom he has gained through his decades of public service.

AD

“I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,” the 76-year-old former vice president said.

Warren, 70, also fielded a similar question. She emphasized her tenacity, arguing that she will work harder than any other candidate, regardless of age.

“Well, I say, I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said, a nod to the possibility that Trump may be removed from office before the 2020 election.

Sanders, asked about health, says he’s ‘feeling great’

As the debate approached the two-hour mark, Sanders faced a question about his health.

“I’m healthy. I’m feeling great,” he said when a moderator broached the subject, before he insisted on weighing in on a previous question about drug laws.

When Booker pointed out Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders quipped, “I'm not on it tonight.""

Then Sanders, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago, gave a more serious answer, telling Americans he would prove to them that he has the fitness to serve by “mounting a vigorous campaign,” including a comeback rally with a special guest in New York on Saturday.

Klobuchar makes opioid epidemic personal

Klobuchar made a question about the opioid epidemic personal by relating a story about her father, who struggled with an alcohol addiction, as a reason there should be more investment in treatment programs.

“My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI, they said to him, ‘you’re going to face jail or you got to go to treatment.’ He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace, and he has been sober ever since,” Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar has spoken about her father’s struggles before, most famously during the confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh.

The senator also mentioned drug executives’ emails revealed by The Washington Post, in which one said about pills: “Just like Doritos keep eating. We’ll make more.”

Debate turns to gun control

The candidates delivered impassioned arguments on gun control, with several — including Booker, Harris and Castro — referencing their personal experience with gun violence in their communities.

Harris said that there are 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America today and noted her experience meeting with the family of gun violence victims, including police officers shot in the line of duty, during her time in California.

“I’m done,” Harris said. “And we need action. And Congress has had years to act and failed because they have not had the courage.”

Klobuchar noted that polls show a majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks. “I just don’t want to screw this up,” she said.

Castro prompted applause from the crowd when he called for action on the case of Atatiana Jefferson, who was fatally shot in her home by a Fort Worth police officer.

“Police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that,” Castro said.

O’Rourke and Buttigieg also had a heated exchange on guns, after a moderator asked O’Rourke how he would enforce his proposed mandatory buyback of AR-15s and AK-47s.

O’Rourke said he would trust his fellow Americans to follow the law.

“You just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the street. If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait,” Buttigieg shot back. “We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.”

O’Rourke said those challenges were not mutually exclusive. He said he also supports a ban on the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines, and red-flag laws. He called for a comprehensive gun-control policy. “Let’s decide what we are going to believe and what we are going to achieve. And let’s bring this country together in order to do that,” O’Rourke said. ““Let’s … not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups.”

“The problem isn’t the polls. The problem is the policy,” Buttigieg said dryly. “And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

Biden calls on foreign policy experience

Playing up his decades of foreign policy experience, Biden said that he’s the only person on the stage who had “spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan,” referring to the leaders of Russia and Turkey.

Biden also blasted Trump for how he’s conducted global affairs.

“We have an erratic crazy president, who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says: ‘I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don’t believe our intelligence.’”

Booker also attacked Trump’s relationship with Putin, saying he had turned “the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire.”

“Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president, time and time again, is showing moral weakness. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron,” Booker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. “… I will stop this, and restore American integrity abroad.”

Asked about Trump’s decision, Castro launched a double-edged attack, criticizing the president’s policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking aim at his withdrawal of troops from Syria.

“Think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free,” Castro said.

Sanders isn’t toning it down

Sanders gave a fiery answer, a signal that he is not toning down his combative tendencies in the wake of his health scare.

“Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they engage in another mass slaughter,” he said forcefully in the second hour of the debate.

Earlier, he eagerly reminded viewers that when it comes to Medicare-for-all, he “wrote the damn bill.""

And he gave one of the most impassioned defenses yet of his health-care plan, challenging Democrats to have the “guts” to stand up to the insurance companies and fight for a system that offers universal care.

Two veterans onstage face off on involvement in Syria

Gabbard and Buttigieg, the only veterans onstage, faced off on the question of U.S. involvement in Syria and what to do about Turkey’s attack on the Kurds, waged days after Trump ordered U.S. troops out of Syria.

Gabbard called the situation “yet another negative consequence of the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.” But she placed blame beyond Trump to include politicians “from both parties” and the mainstream media.

“Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” Buttigieg told Gabbard. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

He said U.S. troops were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and the resurgence of the Islamic State.

“Really, what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is you would continue to support having troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time, to continue this regime-change war?” Gabbard asked.

Buttigieg said what the United States was doing in Syria was keeping its word.

“Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too,” he said. “I would have a hard time today looking at an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there, and it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.”

Buttigieg, Klobuchar call Warren’s plans unrealistic

For the second time this evening, Buttigieg and Klobuchar attacked Warren for promoting an unrealistic policy. Both went after her wealth-tax plan and tried to appeal to more-moderate voters.

“Washington politicians … [offer] the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes,” Buttigieg said, a comment directed at Warren.

Klobuchar chimed in with a more pointed attack, suggesting that Warren’s characterization of her competitors’ plans was unfair.

“I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea,” Klobuchar said.

O’Rourke joined in too, calling the Massachusetts Democrat’s wealth-tax plan “punitive.”

Warren quickly fired back. “I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive,” she said.

After the moderators tossed a question to Booker, the New Jersey Democrat took a moment to call on his competitors to tone down the intraparty attacks.

“You know, we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate really matters,” Booker said, drawing applause from the crowd.

Billionaires’ place in America is discussed

At one point, Sanders was asked whether his goal was to “tax billionaires out of existence.” The Vermont senator launched into a lengthy speech about income inequality in the United States, lamenting the staggering number of homeless, uninsured, underinsured and debt-burdened Americans.

“Then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is a moral and economic outrage,” Sanders said. “And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class.”

Steyer, the only billionaire on the debate stage, agreed that Sanders was right to go after the wealthy.

“There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful,” Steyer said. “As Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income, it’s absolutely wrong, it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.”

Steyer then advocated for a wealth tax, ending Trump’s tax cuts and increasing the minimum wage.

Warren takes on Yang on universal basic income

Warren found herself on defense for much of the first half-hour of the debate. But as the end of the first hour neared, she played offense against Yang, taking on the entrepreneur over his signature issue, universal basic income, which would guarantee every American $1,000 a month, no matter their employment status.

“I think the thing closest to universal basic income is Social Security,” Warren said, arguing that her proposal for strengthening Social Security would do more to protect vulnerable Americans than Yang’s plan.

She added that she wants to “see the data.”

“I have the data,” Yang quickly shot back.

Harris brings up abortion

During the back and forth on Medicare-for-all, Harris noted that women’s reproductive rights did not come up in any of the previous debates, even though, she said, Republican state legislatures are trying to dismantle those rights.

“This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women’s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,” she said. “It’s outrageous.”

Harris continued, “People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.”

Medicare-for-all: Who would pay?

In the first policy debate of the evening, Warren and Buttigieg sparred over whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare-for-all.

“I have made clear what my principles are here: Costs will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Warren said.

Buttigieg, who has previously accused Warren of being “evasive” on that question, said she was doing so again on the debate stage.

“A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Buttigieg charged, before touting his own plan, “Medicare for All Who Want It,” which institutes a public option but allows private insurance companies to remain.

Sanders cut in, noting that he was the person “who wrote the damn bill.”

If the proposal is passed, taxes are going to go up significantly — for the wealthiest Americans, Sanders said.

Warren faced more flak from another opponent: Klobuchar, who argued Warren was “making Republican talking points right now in this room.”

Klobuchar also prompted applause from the crowd — a rarity so far this evening — when she raised the issue of the opioid epidemic.

Sanders and Biden, who have long disagreed over health-care policy, engaged in one of their sharpest exchanges on the topic in any debate.

Biden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg’s thunder by saying that the mayor’s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded — expanding Obamacare.

Sanders snapped back, arguing that those who are defending the current system are advocating for a problematic approach in which many Americans are suffering. He said he gets “a little tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.”

Biden addresses questions on Ukraine

Biden said he did nothing wrong when he worked on Ukrainian policy as vice president while his son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on,” Biden said.

Biden then pivoted to talking about Trump’s corruption, saying a statement his son put out today “speaks for itself.”

Pressed to answer whether it was a mistake for his son to take the position, Biden dodged the question.

“I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,” Biden said. “We’ve always kept everything separate even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We never discussed it so there’d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say.”

It was unclear what judgment Biden was referring to, but he seemed to be talking about his son’s public statement where he said it was a mistake for him to take the job.

Yang wants to talk about economic problems

While many of the candidates spent their first few minutes talking about Trump and the impeachment inquiry, Yang took a different approach, encouraging Democrats to focus on the economic problems that paved the way for Trump’s win in 2016.

“When we talk about him, we are losing,” Yang said of Trump. He noted that the debate was unfolding in Ohio, a state Trump won. “Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?” he asked, before pointing out the manufacturing job losses that have occurred in the state.

“These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected,” Yang said.

Steyer makes debate-stage debut

In his first debate appearance, Steyer noted that he began his “Need to Impeach” campaign two years ago, long before the other Democrats onstage embraced the idea.

Even as he sought to distinguish himself from the others onstage, Steyer also praised them, saying that every Democratic candidate was “more decent and patriotic than the criminal in the White House.”

Buttigieg, meanwhile, cast himself as a uniter who can bring the country together after Trump has left the White House. “One way or another, this presidency is going to come to an end,” Buttigieg said, asking listeners what it’s going to feel like the first day the sun comes up after Trump is no longer president. “Really think about where we’ll be — vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.”

“I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country,” he added.

Candidates talk about impeachment support

In his first comments, Biden said Trump’s decision to stonewall every congressional investigation led him to support the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Biden drew a contrast between Trump and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. At that time, Biden said lawmakers needed to be mindful of the American people’s vote.

“He’s gone so far to say since this latest event … I will not cooperate,” Biden said. “They have no choice but to move.”

Biden, who has found himself at the center of the impeachment inquiry, said nothing more about the specifics of the House investigation or his role in it.

Harris echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn’t think the impeachment process would take very long.

“Because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it,” Harris said.

Striking a more cautious tone, Booker said he understood “the outrage that we all feel” but said it was important to conduct the impeachment process in an “honorable” way that did not further divide the country.

Both Klobuchar and Castro brushed off concerns that impeachment would be a “distraction,” saying U.S. lawmakers and voters were capable of doing two things at once.

“When [Trump] made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent,” Klobuchar said. “That’s illegal conduct; that’s what he was doing.”

Sanders goes after Trump and Republicans

Sanders, who has been off the campaign trail for two weeks after suffering a heart attack, also went after Trump and Senate Republicans. “Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” said Sanders, speaking about the topic of impeachment.

While his voice was a bit scratchy as he spoke, Sanders sounded much clearer than he did in the last debate, when he was noticeably hoarse. He is positioned toward the middle of the stage, to the left of Biden. Sanders stood patiently with his hands in front of him as Biden delivered his first remarks of the debate.

Debate starts with discussion of impeachment

The moderators wasted no time tackling the issue of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Warren got the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump’s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.

Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt president in history. He highlighted the White House’s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. “They have no choice but to move,” he said of House Democrats.

The debate

To qualify, candidates had to hit 2 percent in at least four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee and receive contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors. The debate is at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, in the Columbus suburbs."

12. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii): The Hawaii congresswoman is one of two candidates who didn’t make the third debate but did make the fourth next week.

11. Businessman Tom Steyer: This will be his first debate, period.

7. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.): Klobuchar is ahead of all the other names here because she’s showing some life in Iowa, where her RealClearPolitics average is 4.7 percent. But that’s her neighboring state, and she’ll need to show nationwide appeal, too. (Previous ranking: 8)

6. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.): Booker told his supporters he needed a cash influx to stay in the race, and he says he has gotten it. Now he’s apparently leaning heavily on Iowa. “I’m in it to finish first in the caucuses,” he told CBS News this week. “That’s what we’re fighting for. And I believe we can. We have well over 100 days to do that.” He’s currently averaging 2.3 percent in Iowa, though. (Previous ranking: 5)

5. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Something that has struck me about Buttigieg’s poll numbers: He has often been one of the most popular candidates among Democratic voters — as in, as high as the second-most-popular candidate in the first two states, behind Elizabeth Warren. And he keeps raising big money. But he’s not gaining in the polls quite yet. (Previous ranking: 6)

4. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.): Speaking of Iowa-first, Harris is apparently in on that, too — which, as with Booker, is probably a reflection of how much they need an early kick-start to keep their campaigns going. She has lost all of her post-first-debate bump and is back where she started in the polls. (Previous ranking: 4)

3. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): The big news, of course, is his recent heart attack. We can’t pretend that doesn’t matter for a 78-year-old candidate. There are also questions about why his campaign didn’t disclose it until a couple days later. (He bristled at the idea that they hid the news, saying it was a matter of figuring out what happened.) That said, even as he has lost ground in the polls, he’s clearly ahead of the others above and in the first tier. He really needs to show something, though — especially with Warren rising.

2. Former vice president Joe Biden: He’s up a spot from last month, given Sanders’s lack of traction. But Biden doesn’t seem to have a good answer for Trump’s Ukraine attacks. That probably owes to the fact that, even if the allegations about his actions are way beyond the evidence, Hunter Biden’s employment and lucrative salary at a Ukrainian energy company don’t exactly look great. He probably feels wronged in that he has to talk about all this, but it’s not going away. It’s now the focus of an impeachment inquiry, so he had better figure out a message — and soon. (Previous ranking: 3)

1. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): I’ve had Warren atop this list for a while, but now she’s a significantly bigger favorite than before. She has recently taken the lead in some polling averages and in early-state polls. That owes in part to her opponents’ stumbles, and in part to her own very strong campaign thus far. As Democrats begin to come to terms with the idea that she’s probably their most likely nominee, we’ll see how she holds up. (Previous ranking: 1)

We shouldn’t be too dismissive, of course. Money enables you to pay for advertising and for staff, especially the organizers who are vital to corralling supporters in the early states.

AD

But it’s notable that Sanders is raising all that money at a time when he’s been struggling to win over new converts, and that struggle has led to a lot of negative media stories with headlines like “Bernie Sanders Is in Trouble.”

Or look at Pete Buttigieg. He has run a remarkably effective fundraising campaign for a 30-something mayor of a small city. In the second quarter of the year, he raised $24.8 million. In the third quarter, he raised $19.1 million.

And what has the money produced? The RealClearPolitics poll average puts Buttigieg at 5.4 percent nationally, vying for fourth place with Kamala D. Harris. He does slightly better in Iowa, but he’s still in fourth place there. He might experience a surge of interest and support, but it probably won’t happen because he drops a few tens of millions on Iowa.

The lesson: Money is necessary to win a presidential nomination, but not sufficient.

That’s especially true when everyone seems to have plenty of money, at least among the top and mid-tier candidates. If you were the only one running thousands of Facebook ads, that would be one thing, but if your ads are jostling for attention with those of 10 other candidates, all the spending probably isn’t doing much good, other than forcing voters not to forget you exist.

Speaking of Facebook, the biggest political spender there is, of course, President Trump, who has been pouring money into ads on the platform all year. He has already spent millions on Facebook ads defending himself on impeachment just in the past few days. To what end? The ads are no doubt being watched by his most ardent supporters, or hate-watched by his opponents. But is anyone really being persuaded to change their minds about him?

AD

AD

As of his last quarterly report three months ago, Trump’s reelection campaign had already spent more than $150 million, if you include the outside groups supporting him. And yet he trails all the leading Democrats in pretty much every head-to-head matchup.

If you were sitting next to Mitch McConnell, he’d lean over and say, “See, I told you — there isn’t too much money in politics. This is all fine.”

That is most definitely not the point. Politicians still become captive to their donors, and there are lots of situations where big money sways elections. But those are more likely to happen lower down the ballot — House races, statehouse races, local races — where a corporation or super-rich individual can give a candidate so much help that the whole playing field is tilted.

AD

Indeed, while so much money pours into presidential campaigns that another million here or there doesn’t really change anything, that’s not true in down-ballot races. And there some really important ones going on right now.

AD

In Virginia, where Republicans narrowly control both houses of the state legislature, Democrats have a good shot to seize total control of state government in this November’s elections. That would mean they’ll not only be able to pass all kinds of progressive legislation that could positively affect people’s lives, it also means they’ll control redistricting after the 2020 Census.

This is also true of many of the state legislative contests that will be unfolding across the country in 2020, which could impact voting rights, redistricting and local legislative battles in all kinds of ways. Just ask Republicans — who swept state races in 2010 and used their new power to gerrymander and pass voter suppression laws to lock that power in for the years that followed — how important those races are.

AD

And those races can turn on a relatively small amount of money. I’m not trying to discourage anyone from donating to a presidential candidate. If you’re inclined to give the one you like $20 or $100 or $1,000, go right ahead. But you might consider matching that donation with another to somebody who could really use it.

234,Paul Waldman,Yet in the three rounds of debates nearly 15 hours of discussion around bold policies every candidate promises to enact if elected zero questions have been asked about what candidates would do to ensure their agenda is not stymied by an activist conservative … [+4233 chars],"No issue is more important, and Tuesday's debate is a good place to start.",2019-10-14,The Washington Post,Why the Democratic candidates need to start talking about the Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/14/why-democratic-candidates-need-start-talking-about-supreme-court/,"Yet in the three rounds of debates – nearly 15 hours of discussion around bold policies every candidate promises to enact if elected – zero questions have been asked about what candidates would do to ensure their agenda is not stymied by an activist conservative court that was rigged against them when Mitch McConnell and the Republicans manipulated the size of the court in 2016/17 to steal a seat.

The failure to focus on the issue of the court is an atrocious oversight on the part of the networks that have aired and moderated these debates, for three reasons:

AD

AD

1. The Supreme Court touches nearly every key policy issue. Just in the term that began this month, the court will have the chance to eviscerate abortion rights, decide whether LGBTQ people deserve protection from discrimination, determine the fate of the “dreamers” and strike down the Affordable Care Act, to name but a few issues. We’re already seeing the fruits of a decades-long effort by the right to remake the courts, and if President Trump gets a second term, he could well replace both Ruth Bader Ginsburg (age 86) and Stephen G. Breyer (age 81), producing a 7-2 conservative majority and cementing a shift more radical than voters can begin to understand.

2. The Supreme Court is the cornerstone of Republican minority rule. Right now the GOP holds the bulk of power in Washington — the presidency, the Senate, the Supreme Court — despite the fact that they have won the popular vote in only one of the past seven presidential elections. Republicans control the Senate despite the fact that millions more Americans voted for Democrats to sit in that chamber. Conservatives on the court have used their power to ensure that GOP minority rule prevails: gutting the Voting Rights Act, validating partisan gerrymandering and rubber-stamping nearly every technique of Republican voter suppression that comes before them.

3. If a Democrat becomes president, the Supreme Court could kneecap their entire agenda. Imagine that Democrats win the White House and take control of the Senate in 2020. They pass sweeping health-care reform, enhancements of workers’ rights, strong action on climate change, enhancements of voting rights, anti-corruption reforms, and so on. If these bills pass, Republicans will quickly file lawsuits to get them struck down. And the Supreme Court could do just that, declaring piece after piece of progressive legislation unconstitutional. The conservative judges would effectively place the United States in a kind of policy holding pattern, until the next Republican president and Congress can take office and continue marching our laws to the right whether that’s what the voters want or not.

AD

AD

So voters need to know how the presidential candidates understand this problem and what to do about it. And this is an area where there are differences that ought to be hashed out. Some, including Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala D. Harris, have expressed an openness to expanding the number of seats on the court, at a minimum to rebalance things after Republicans twice changed the number of seats in 2016-2017 following the death of Antonin Scalia (first they changed the number of justices from nine to eight, refusing to consider Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland; then after Donald Trump was elected they changed the size of the court again, bringing it back up to nine). Other candidates, including Bernie Sanders, oppose the idea, while some, including Joe Biden, haven’t yet taken a public position. Another idea, to create term limits for justices, has also garnered interest from some candidates. They should all have to say where they stand.

It’s almost certain that if a Democrat wins in 2020, that president’s relationship to the Supreme Court — the cases the court decides, the justices that president will appoint, the future of the court’s makeup — will be one of the most important factors shaping their presidency. No Democratic voter should make his or her decision without knowing what the candidates intend to do about it. So it’s past time to have a full discussion about how the Supreme Court is going to affect all of our lives in the years to come.

It’s hard to see how she’ll solve it.

Up until recently, Warren had seemed open to multiple approaches to achieve universal coverage and control costs. Although she co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’s single-payer plan in the Senate, she also co-sponsored other, more modest proposals (that’s true of other candidates, including Sanders himself).

But eventually Warren began speaking more firmly about her support for Medicare-for-all. Even if it’s a term with various definitions, she made clear her belief that insurance companies are at the center of what ails the system. They extract billions in profits while adding no value to anyone. And they do it, as Warren often points out, by collecting as much as possible in premiums and paying out as little as possible in claims.

At a different time, those ideas might still have left flexibility to take a number of approaches. The problem Warren faces is that within the Democratic Party, what used to be a lefty proposal — the creation of a widely available public option resembling Medicare or Medicaid — has now become the conservative position. The candidates espousing it — Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar — are now attacking Warren from the right.

A couple of years ago, Warren could have said, “I support Medicare-for-all, which is why we should create a public option now, and over time, more people will migrate to it from private insurance. The transition will be less disruptive than if we did it all at once.” That wouldn’t have been seen as contradictory.

But now, saying that — especially since it’s basically what Buttigieg says — would be seen as a sellout and a flip-flop. Warren has seemingly been trapped into proposing something more closely resembling Sanders’s plan, not just by what she has said but by the way the rest of the field has moved.

That’s what happened to Kamala D. Harris. She’d said some of the same things as Warren about insurance companies. But when she released her plan — which would allow private insurers to compete with a government plan and so essentially universalize Medicare as it is now and not as it is in Sanders’s enormously generous vision (which is “Medicare-for-all” in the same way a Lexus LC500 is a Toyota Corolla) — it was greeted with contempt from the right and the left.

Warren could face the same problem. About a year and a half ago, Democrats all started saying they wanted Medicare-for-all, but they were using the term to refer to both single-payer and public option plans. Then pollsters began asking about it, and it turned out public option plans are much more popular.

AD

AD

The most important reason for this is loss aversion — people are afraid of losing what they have even if they’ll get something better in exchange and react positively to choice. There are plenty of arguments as to why single payer is actually superior, but few believe the public will grasp the nuances.

Before, the political advantages of public option plans weren’t clear. Now they are. That’s Warren’s dilemma: How can she offer something true to what she has said until now and doesn’t open her up to attacks that prey on the public’s fear of losing their insurance?

I honestly have no idea. But meanwhile, let’s keep a couple of things in mind.

The first is that the media’s incessant focus (and that of a couple of the candidates) on whether taxes will be raised on the middle class to fund Medicare-for-all is utterly inane. The whole point is moving from a system in which trillions of dollars are shunted through insurance companies to one in which that money moves through the government — minus what the insurance companies take for themselves.

AD

AD

When Warren says that what matters is the cost people pay and not whether it goes toward taxes or premiums, she’s exactly right. According to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, the typical family of four with employer-sponsored coverage now spends $12,500 a year on health care, plus $1,450 in Medicare taxes, plus $13,050 that their employer contributes, for a total of $27,000 dollars in total costs.

The idea that it would be somehow worse to pay more in taxes while paying less in premiums and co-pays is both absurd and dishonest.

The second is that that we in the media judge Democrats and Republicans by wildly different standards when evaluating this kind of policy proposal. Donald Trump’s 2016 health-care plan consisted of “Everybody’s going to be taken care of, much better than they’re taken care of now.” It was gibberish, but the media pretty much let it slide.

AD

AD

Even before its release, Warren’s plan is being treated as though cost is the only thing that matters. But the far more important questions include: How will this work? What will the effects be on providers? How long will the transition be? How does Warren plan to overcome the opposition of wealthy interests? What will it mean for our economy and quality of life when everyone is covered and no one ever has to fight with an insurance company again?

Those are the questions we should be asking. I hope she has some good answers.

Over the past year, America’s meritocracy has racked up some poor marks.

Back in March, the “Varsity Blues” scandal revealed that a bunch of extremely rich, incredibly insecure parents had been placing their academically unaccomplished children into selective colleges through an elaborate mix of bribery and fraud. This news triggered an explosion of self-righteous Schadenfreude among upper-middle-class parents who’d been working their tails off to buy their kids’ admission to elite finishing schools the old-fashioned way (i.e., through the purchase of a home in an affluent suburb with well-funded public schools, the hiring of a pricey SAT tutor, the bankrolling of various impressive-sounding extracurriculars, etc.). Which, in turn, prompted the self-righteous children of such bourgeois parents to decry their class’s “dream hoarding” ways: A chorus of scholars and pundits observed that, even if America were a perfect meritocracy (untainted by the criminality of Felicity Huffman & Co.), the already affluent’s superior capacity to invest in their offspring’s “human capital” would be enough to undermine mobility and entrench privilege.

That critique garnered renewed attention in recent weeks with the release of Yale Law professor Daniel Markovits’s book The Meritocracy Trap. Building on the themes of his viral 2015 commencement address, Markovits’s book argues that the American economy has become grossly inequitable and misery-inducing precisely because of “meritocracy’s successes.” In his telling, inequality is now driven primarily by the bifurcation of the labor market. Under existing economic arrangements, those at the top of the ladder really do “earn” their privilege by accruing exorbitantly valuable skills and exercising them at a relentless pace. The new one percent is the opposite of a leisure class, as its members work “with crushing intensity, exploiting their expensive educations in order to extract a return.” Then, they invest that return into their children’s expensive educations, thereby reproducing an exceptionally anxious, entitled, and high-skilled pseudo-aristocracy, which is killing upward mobility and eroding human welfare for poor and rich alike.

There’s value in spotlighting the inequities inherent to actually existing meritocracy. And all things equal, it is better to expose and punish rich parents who criminally subvert meritocratic institutions than to let them run wild.

And yet all this hand-wringing about dream hoarders — and basking in Lori Loughlin’s comeuppance — threatens to obscure just how anti-meritocratic America’s elite institutions and economy remain.

Take Harvard University’s admissions practices. A recent, controversial lawsuit accusing the school of discriminating against Asian applicants forced Harvard to disclose “detailed information on [the] demographics, academics, and extracurricular activities” of its applicants, along with its internal ratings of prospective students. This provided researchers with unprecedented insight into how America’s premier university rations access to its campus. Last week, three economists unearthed one stunning fact hiding within that data: Between 2009 and 2014, 43 percent of the white students admitted to Harvard were either athletes, legacies, faculty kids, or the offspring of major donors. And white students with these characteristics were held to a decidedly less-demanding standard than those who lacked them: Roughly three-quarters of these applicants would have been rejected, had they lacked athletic skills or connections, according to the economists’ analysis. Critically, athletic admissions often function as a proxy for familial wealth and/or connections.

As Slate’s Jordan Weissmann explains:

Legacy preferences, which give an edge to the children of alums, have long drawn criticism for skewing college admissions in favor of white, well-off families. But in recent years, athletic recruiting has come under scrutiny for playing a similar role, especially in sports like sailing, skiing, lacrosse, and crew that are particularly popular among wealthier white Americans. The Harvard Crimson’s annual survey found that among the Class of 2019, 43.2 percent of legacies and 20 percent of athletes come from households that earn more than $500,000 a year, versus 15.4 percent of the class overall.

These dimensions of advantage are largely class-based (you don’t have to be white to give a large donation to Harvard, or finance your child’s sailing education, but you do probably need a lot of disposable income). But owing to the racial composition of America’s economic elite, affirmative action for the wealthy is tantamount to affirmative action for whites: While 43 percent of white Harvard students were athletes, legacies, or the children of faculty or donors, less than 16 percent of their nonwhite peers fit into one of those favored categories.

Regardless, for the purposes of assessing the degree of meritocracy in America’s elite institutions, evidence of class-based affirmative action will suffice. In total, about 30 percent of all seats in each Harvard class are effectively reserved for children with rich, well-connected parents, and/or athletic skills. The historian Nils Gilman tweeted last month that this 30 percent “is the ‘Real Harvard’ — that is, the profitable bit, the part that the aptly named Harvard Corporation cares about; the rest of the students are financial loss leaders whose purpose is to provide a brand halo for the Real Harvard, and to justify the tax shelter.”

In other words: Per Gilman, Harvard is effectively a business that auctions off certificates of legitimation to the American aristocracy’s lackluster heirs and heiresses — that highly selective, meritocratic college it maintains is just an elaborate means of preserving the value of its aristocracy-legitimation services.

Gilman’s assessment is surely a bit reductive. But it contains more than a kernel of truth. Harvard is, in fact, sustained by the patronage of superrich benefactors, not the tuition paid by its students. In 2016, the university took in $1.19 billion in donations, a figure that’s several multiples of what it accrued in tuition. That same year, the Harvard Crimson published this illustration of the university’s finances (note: The endowment is composed in no small part by past gifts from large-dollar donors):

Chart: The Harvard Crimson

Now, even if we stipulate that Harvard is an institution that exists to legitimize hereditary privilege — by providing its patrons’ “failsons and fail-daughters” with the same prestigious credential that it bestows on academically elite strivers — it wouldn’t necessarily follow that all of America’s meritocratic institutions serve the same basic function. But viewed from a certain angle, Harvard’s operations can look analogous to those of the American upper class more broadly: Whether on Harvard’s campus or in the economy writ large, the cutthroat competition between bourgeois strivers for well-remunerated jobs serves to lend an aura of meritocratic legitimacy to the (relatively) idle and hereditary capitalist class whose fortunes underwrite the whole shebang. As Malcolm Harris writes in his critical appraisal of The Meritocracy Trap:

Markovits consistently refers to his meritocrats as “the 1 percent,” but in a mistake so fundamental it can’t possibly be a mere oversight, he doesn’t mean the top 1 percent by wealth (those with assets over $10 million), he means the top 1 percent by income (those with an annual household income of over $420,000). The groups are hardly comparable — one is made up largely of people who own companies, the other of the people who figure out how to make those companies profitable … In the May 2018 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Saez, Zucman, and Piketty repeatedly, explicitly reject the thesis that the richest income earners owe the bulk of their fortunes to labor rather than capital. “The top 1% derives over half of their incomes from capital, the top 0.1% more than two thirds today,” they write. The difference between their less-than-one-third and Markovits’s “perhaps two-thirds or even three-quarters” is massive. In a footnote the economists add, “If anything, it is likely that we underestimate the rise of the capital income share at the top over recent decades.”

To be sure, America’s highest-earning meritocrats, and its biggest recipients of passive capital income, heavily overlap. And Markovits does summon significant evidence that today’s Über-rich hustle more than yesterday’s did.

But in between bouts of lamenting our meritocracy’s excesses, we should take a moment to acknowledge its limited reach. In many respects, this is still Wyatt Koch’s country, we “dream hoarders” just work here."

If there is one thing conservatives have worked hard to sell to the American public and the courts, it is the principle that only the text of a statute controls — that what legislators enacted is the law, and that judges are duty-bound to interpret the words, and only the words, in the legislative language. No more, no less. With Justice Antonin Scalia as the leading advocate for this project, they’ve succeeded, convincing even liberal jurists that textualism in the interpretation of statutes is the way to go.

On Tuesday, as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a trio of cases grappling with whether federal employment law already protects gay and transgender workers from discrimination in the workplace, Justice Elena Kagan summarized the success of Scalia’s enterprise. “For many years,” she said from the bench, “the lodestar of this Court’s statutory interpretation has been the text of a statute, not the legislative history, and certainly not the subsequent legislative history.”

This is not the first time Kagan has endorsed textualism. But with the Trump administration all but abandoning textualist arguments in arguing that Congress never intended the words “because … of sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to encompass workplace discrimination against LGBTQ employees, she may have felt the need to remind everyone where she and most of her colleagues stood nowadays. “Did you discriminate against somebody … because of sex? Yes, you did. Because you fired the person because this was a man who loved other men,” Kagan said during the first of the morning’s two hearings, and then added: “If he were a woman, he wouldn’t have been fired.”

Then came this little lecture: “This is the usual kind of way in which we interpret statutes now. We look to laws. We don’t look to predictions. We don’t look to desires. We don’t look to wishes. We look to laws.” Scalia, Kagan’s erstwhile hunting partner, would’ve been proud.

By now, there’s little doubt that the looming decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express v. Zarda, and R.R. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, the three cases the Supreme Court considered over the course of two hours on Tuesday, will be a landmark for gay rights. Until last year, when Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, in effect surrendering his seat and legacy to Donald Trump, those rights appeared secure, yet amenable to a raft of religious challenges that the Supreme Court nonetheless seemed in no rush to settle. No more: Neither Scalia’s replacement, Justice Neil Gorsuch, nor Kennedy’s, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, are the centrist pragmatists that prior Republican appointees strived to be. They’re culture warriors in the mold of Justice Samuel Alito, who has worried publicly about morality and religion being under siege in the United States, and who on Tuesday expressed concern about “what some people will say” if the nation’s highest court were to rule that a civil-rights statute enacted more than 50 years ago were now read to encompass job protections for gay and transgender workers.

Alito couldn’t help but answer his own question: “What they will say is that whether Title VII should prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a big policy issue, and it is a different policy issue from the one that Congress thought it was addressing 1964.” He added that reading that into the law, which lawmakers have declined to amend to cover this kind of discrimination, would be akin to “acting exactly like a legislature.” Alito is correct to note that Congresses past have tried but failed to update Title VII to explicitly bar employers from taking adverse employment actions against LGBTQ workers. This past May, the Democratic-led House passed a sweeping bill that not only would do that, if signed into law, but would also overhaul other federal anti-discrimination laws. The bill is now sitting in committee, and probably will until the Senate changes hands.

But if you’re a real textualist, all of that is beside the point. As Pamela Karlan, the lawyer for the two gay men at the center of the first half of Tuesday’s session, put it in her straightforward first few minutes at the podium, Title VII as it exists today resolves the case:

When an employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing. And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee’s failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not to men.

Karlan’s first few minutes at the podium were so assertive and to the point, she even left the justices speechless for a few seconds. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, herself an early proponent of a slow and incremental understanding of gender equality under the law, asked Karlan to describe why discrimination against gays and lesbians “could not have been in Congress’s mind” at a time when many states outlawed same-sex relationships and homosexuality was considered a mental illness by American Psychiatric Association. Karlan responded: “In 1964, those were the days of Mad Men, so the idea that sexual orientation would have been reached — most courts didn’t find sexual harassment to be actionable until this Court did.”

Indeed, there’s no evidence that the Congress that approved the 1964 law ever had considered sexual harassment of the Me Too kind to be a form of sex discrimination at the moment of passage. It took advocates and social movements beginning in the 1970s to convince American courts, including the Supreme Court, that that was the case. The same goes for declaring unlawful sex stereotypes about how women should dress and behave, or that Title VII covers “severely hostile or abusive” harassment by men against another man for not carrying himself like society expects him to. “The critical issue, Title VII’s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed,” Scalia once wrote in a ruling that’s critical to the plaintiffs in these cases.

Yet this jurisprudential history didn’t seem to carry much persuasive force with some of the more conservative justices on Tuesday. Instead, there were concerns about bathroom usage, “massive social upheaval,” and what would happen to “judicial modesty,” as Gorsuch put it, if the Supreme Court were to find that LGBTQ workers are somehow protected by existing federal law. Not to be left behind, a lawyer for the Trump administration, which tried unsuccessfully to reverse a years-long position by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on these issues, also sounded the alarm, as if to dare the justices to not go where lawmakers haven’t. “I actually find it troubling for courts to take that approach because I actually think it deprives the people of the ability to struggle with these issues democratically,” Noel Francisco, the Justice Department’s solicitor general, said.

Those were precisely the worries voiced at the time the Supreme Court settled, for the entire nation, marriage equality once and for all. The sky didn’t fall — there may still be open questions about wedding cakes and photographers and other religious objections, but the country has more or less adjusted to the new reality. Neither did the sky fall when Congress, several decades ago, imposed on employers and businesses, even those southern establishments that once claimed religion gave them a right to discriminate, an obligation to treat everyone equally. Begrudgingly or not, everyone adjusted.

The question, then, becomes whether the Supreme Court is ready to declare what the law is with the text that’s in front of it. If it does, and there’s a backlash, as there has been in this same area of the law, there’s a solution. “Interpreting a statute is not depriving the democratic process,” the ACLU’s David Cole, who represented transgender worker Aimee Stephens, told the justices on Tuesday. “It is doing what the Court is supposed to do within the democratic process, and of course if the democratic process disagrees with the Court’s interpretation of the statute, it can change it.”"

Warren, who has begun to eclipse Sanders’s standing among the Democratic Party’s most liberal voters, has not yet released her third-quarter fundraising totals.

Another candidate, author Marianne Williamson, said Thursday that she had raised slightly more than $3 million in the third quarter. While that almost equaled her campaign’s total take in the first two quarters of the year, she ended the most recent filing period with less than $656,000 on hand.

Perhaps worse for Biden, his lead over President Trump, which has bolstered his electability argument, is declining. (“The October poll showed Biden beating Trump 51 percent to 44 percent. He led 54 percent [to] 42 percent in September.”)

Let’s look at five critical questions for Democrats, beginning with Biden. His own numbers are slightly down, but his biggest challenge is a clear opponent in second place who has vacuumed up support from other contenders. Warren seems to have improved at Sanders’s expense but also as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Beto O’Rourke and others remain mired in middle to low single digits. While Biden is punching back against Trump and spurious accusations against himself, he has yet to puncture Warren’s appeal. For him, the real question is: How and when does he take on Warren’s progressivism?

That brings us to the second question, this one concerning Warren. She has not had to go after Sanders to establish herself as the stand-out candidate for progressives. Even before Sanders’s heart attack, she was establishing herself as more engaging, prepared and accessible candidate, one with a clear message she articulates well. She has not, however, faced serious challenges, although Buttigieg has begun poking and prodding her to give a direct answer on how she will fund her Medicare-for-all. Debates, we have learned, are not the ideal place to attack another candidate, given the voters’ distaste for intra-party fights. However, at some point either Biden or a Biden alternative from the center of the ideological spectrum is going to need to go directly at voters’ concern that she may be too far left to regain key states lost in 2016. Warren’s big open question: Can she draw from all segments of the party — including moderates and African Americans (many of whom are moderate) — without losing her base?

AD

AD

The third question is whether Sanders, who was already slipping in the polls, falls even further to the point where he is a non-factor or leaves the race entirely? Sanders’ heart attack — and his campaign’s less than immediately candid explanation of his health situation — will undoubtedly and appropriately raise questions about health, age and endurance. (That should also be an issue for Biden, Warren and Trump.) If he does drift down in polling, the assumption is that Warren would win the lion’s share of his voters, but that is far from certain. Polling shows that Biden, however, is the second choice of many Sanders voters. Ryan Cooper wrote in September, “The top second choice for Sanders supporters is actually Biden (26 percent versus 24 percent for Warren). Meanwhile, Sanders is the top second choice for Warren supporters, but only by a small margin (24 percent for Sanders versus 21 percent for Biden). Voters often have weird preferences like that.” Sanders’s question is: Can he can regain his second-place standing and, if not, where do his voters go?

The fourth question has to do with Trump’s impeachment. If he looks more vulnerable, Democratic voters might be willing to take a chance on a riskier candidate; if he is not on the ballot, the entire “electability” argument may be turned on its head given the widespread believe it was Trump personally, not the GOP, who picked the lock on the states in the Upper Midwest. Conversely, Biden might have a good case to make that given the wreckage Trump will leave behind, someone with no learning curve needs to get into the Oval Office as soon as possible, especially on the foreign policy realm. (If the public perceives how badly Trump has bollixed up foreign policy and shredded alliances, Biden’s stock may go up.) So many candidates and voters have operated under the assumption the Trump of pre-impeachment days would be on the ballot, thereby necessitating a certain kind of nominee. The open question for the entire field is: How does impeachment affect both the candidates’ messages and their appeal?

Finally, the early, small states in the primary calendar will have plenty to say about who continues on in the race and who, if anyone, can climb into contention. Both Buttigieg and Harris are campaigning strenuously in Iowa; Buttigieg’s polling and fundraising numbers suggest he could well pass a fading Sanders, especially in an early state Sanders might have been expected to dominate. It once seemed inconceivable that a Midwest mayor of a medium-sized city could move up to challenge the two top contenders. Buttigieg remains a long shot, but not an inconceivable nominee. Our final question then becomes: Is Buttigieg or anyone else in the field capable of riding a wave to a better-than-expected finish in an early state, thereby lifting the candidate into the top tier?

In a recent paper, we studied whether the initial phase of wall construction in the West Bank, between 2000 and 2004, reduced vehicle thefts in Israel. During that period, the Israeli wall was partially constructed, much as is true for the U.S. border wall. We studied vehicle thefts because they are closely related to cross-border smuggling in the United States: About 80 percent of cars stolen in Israel are smuggled to the West Bank to be dismantled into spare parts, which are then sold back to Israeli car shops. Using Israel’s Freedom of Information Act, we obtained data from the Israeli police on all the vehicles stolen in each township, by month, as well as all the vehicle-theft-related arrests, including the detainee’s town of origin. We then tracked whether those thefts dropped as the border wall got closer to completion. Of course, stopping crime isn’t why Israel built the wall; it was fortified primarily to stop Palestinian suicide bombers from entering Israel during the Second Intifada uprising, which lasted from 2000 to 2005.

AD

AD

Much as Trump is doing with the United States’ wall, the Israelis built theirs in stages. The initial segments went up in mid-2002. By the end of 2004, Israel had fortified the border with the northern part of the West Bank, while the southern part was unprotected by the barrier, as you can see in the map below.

Staggered construction divided Israel into three zones. What we’ve marked as “north” was protected by the barrier; “south” wasn’t protected by the barrier; and “outer” included areas remote from the West Bank and unaffected by the barrier. We took advantage of the unequal progress across different segments of the wall to pinpoint whether and how much the wall deterred crime.

The West Bank wall displaced, rather than reduced, smuggling-related crime

AD

A simple comparison of the protected area (“north”) and yet-to-be protected (“south”) areas between 2000 and 2004 suggested a large — but misleading — reduction in cross-border smuggling. This comparison is misleading because on closer inspection, we found that crime had simply been displaced.

AD

To find that, we compared both the protected areas (“north”) and the unprotected areas (“south”) to the unaffected areas (“outer”). We found that vehicle theft in protected areas dropped by 41 percent compared with areas far from the West Bank, while increasing by 34 percent in unprotected towns. The overall reduction in criminal activity was close to zero. During construction, the wall appears to have displaced crime to unprotected areas. Crime rates went back to the pre-wall-period levels once the southern segment of the wall was completed in 2008.

For the protected towns, the wall reduced crime by making it both riskier and costlier to transport stolen vehicles to the West Bank. The reductions in car theft in each protected Israeli town strongly correlated with the increased length of the travel route between that town and the West Bank. On average, each additional kilometer that the wall forced smugglers to transport a stolen car wall decreased car thefts by about 6 percent.

AD

Criminal activity adjusts after the wall goes up

AD

First, the data on arrests on vehicle theft charges showed us that criminals do not appear to shift their activity from protected areas to unprotected towns. The increased crime in unprotected areas probably stems from local criminals becoming more active rather than from northern gangs traveling south.

Second, in the north, we found that although vehicle thefts dropped, other criminal activities — and in particular, burglaries — increased. That’s likely because to sell smaller stolen goods and valuables — electronics, jewelry, cash and the like — criminals could stay in Israel and didn’t have to transport goods to the West Bank.

AD

In other words, while the wall made smuggling costlier and less likely, it also increased other illicit activities. Crime did not decrease.

Lessons for the U.S.-Mexico border wall

AD

Constructing a southern border wall was one of Trump’s keystone campaign promises. So far, he’s made limited progress. By mid-2019, the Trump administration had added only 46.7 miles of new wall to the 654 miles of existing fortifications. Even if the administration succeeds in executing its plan, only 1,000 out of the 1,954 miles of the border will be fortified. It’s supposed to be a partial wall — just like the West Bank wall in the period that we focus on.

The current U.S.-Mexico wall is composed of fencing to stop people from crossing and obstacles to stop vehicles. These measures have not halted cross-border movement. Based on what we found from the West Bank wall, planned fortification along the U.S.-Mexico border is unlikely to result in less crime or less immigration.

AD

Rather, if border fortification reduces migration or criminal activity in one region, it probably will be displaced to a neighboring area farther away, or prompt an increase in other types of criminal activity. A recent study of the U.S.-Mexico border wall suggests this may already be happening: The partially completed wall seems to have ignited inter-cartel competition in Mexico over alternative smuggling routes, leading to more murders in areas less affected by the barrier.

AD

Do our conclusions about Israel’s border wall apply to the U.S. southern border? If walls are ever effective, they should stop the cross-border movement of vehicles, since it is easier for people than for cars to get around a physical barrier. But we find the Israeli wall to be ineffective even at stemming car smuggling. That suggests that a U.S. border wall isn’t likely to meaningfully limit the movement of people from Mexico into the United States.

Then comes the reveal.

AD

Warren’s ad further claims that “if Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they’re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It’s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable — add your name if you agree.”

Warren’s campaign and Facebook’s communications team continued to spar on the subject — on Twitter — well into Saturday night.

Warren (D-Mass.) has called for Facebook to be broken up, an idea that founder Mark Zuckerberg did not like very much. And her latest shot at the platform has continued a debate on disinformation spread by politicians and whether traditional and social media companies have an obligation — or even a right — to curtail them.

AD

AD

Her campaign’s Facebook ad appeared to refer to the controversy surrounding a Trump campaign spot titled “Corruption,” which made false assertions about former vice president Joe Biden and claimed without evidence that the 2020 Democratic presidential contender offered $1 billion to Ukraine to help his son Hunter Biden. It also accused several prominent television journalists of supporting impeachment.

The ad ran as the president finds himself engulfed in scandal, after a whistleblower revealed that Trump appeared to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Those revelations have led House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.

AD

AD

On Saturday night, Facebook’s communications team tagged Warren in a tweet defending the social media giant’s decision to keep the ad, with a new justification that it had also run on some television stations. The senator hit back, writing, “It’s up to you whether you take money to promote lies.”

Politicians are treated differently than other Facebook users when it come to making false claims on the platform, The Washington Post reported Thursday. Politicians’ statements are not subjected to the same fact-checking scrutiny that other advertisements typically go through, the vice president of global affairs and communications Nick Clegg said last month.

“We do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules,” Clegg said. A subsequent post on Facebook’s website clarified that this policy covered “organic content or ads.”

AD

AD

Facebook’s rationale for not curtailing this content boils down to three points: that they fear encroachment on free speech; that these statements are often newsworthy; and that politicians are already fact-checked.

In a written response to the Biden campaign’s complaints, Katie Harbath, the platform’s public policy director for global elections, said that the company allowed such ads to stand because “our approach is grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.”

On Saturday, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone referred The Washington Post to Clegg’s and Harbath’s previous statements.

AD

Of course, it’s not just Facebook that’s taking heat. Democrats such as presidential candidate Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have called for Twitter to take action on Trump’s account, which he has used to share conspiracy theories and lodge racist and sexist attacks against political opponents. Twitter has long refused to do so.

AD

The networks must thread a difficult needle: how to maintain the least toxic political discourse possible without taking actions that will anger privacy experts and free speech advocates, or trigger outrage from conservatives, who frequently allege that the social networks are biased against them.

But campaigns are spending millions of dollars to push these ads to millions of Americans, and citizens on both sides of the aisle are nervous about a repeat of 2016. Facebook has introduced new tools to make political advertising more transparent, including an Ad Library that documents every ad the campaigns and other political entities have run and how much they’re spending on the platform.

AD

But controversies such as the one that has erupted over Trump’s ad suggest to critics that the platform isn’t doing enough to regulate digital campaigning in 2020. If the Trump campaign can claim that Joe Biden tried to give a billion-dollar bribe to Ukraine, then his potential opponents may be left to wonder: What else are they going to try?

AD

Without any clear sense of where lines are on social media, politicians of both parties will likely continue to cross them. And in response, critics of the platform are likely to continue to push for greater accountability.

The controversial Trump ad in question is no longer running on Facebook. It expired on Oct. 6. But according to the Facebook Ad Library, the Trump campaign has since moved on to ads hawking “Where’s Hunter?” T-shirts.

Buttigieg, in contrast, is “trying to focus on choice, not infringing on people’s freedom to make that decision voluntarily.”

It is just the latest example of the increasingly pointed shots the Democratic candidates have been taking at each other in the lead-up to their fourth debate, especially those who are running out of time to break into the top tier.

AD

AD

Buttigieg’s critiques have been particularly notable in recent days. His political persona has generally been that of a genial Midwesterner, but lately he has sharpened his words not only against Warren (D-Mass.) and Sanders (I-Vt.), but also with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) and others.

Buttigieg, 37, has posted impressive fundraising numbers but remains solidly in the second tier — and the single digits — in most polls. In staking out more moderate policy positions than Warren and Sanders, he has cast himself as a potential alternative to former vice president Joe Biden.

Behind him are a slew of other candidates who also appear to be waiting for Biden to falter so they can take on the mantle of field’s leading centrist. That’s led to a series of sharp exchanges in advance of Tuesday’s debate in Westerville, Ohio — – including from Biden. “We’re not electing a planner,” Biden said last week, a thinly veiled jab at Warren, who has made “I have a plan for that” a core refrain in her stump speeches..

AD

AD

In recent weeks, Buttigieg has called a proposal by O’Rourke for a mandatory buyback of AR-15 and AK-47 weapons “a shiny object” that would distract from other, more realistic gun law reform efforts.

O’Rourke, who seized on gun control as a top priority after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August left 22 dead, called Buttigieg’s comments “offensive” to gun violence victims and has repeatedly described the mayor as prioritizing political calculation over doing “the right thing.”

“I really hope that he and other candidates can see that if we’re serious about saving the lives of our fellow Americans, then we have to be serious about the action that we want to take as president,” O’Rourke told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month. “The old way, of triangulating, poll testing, focus-group-driving your way to an answer just is not going to work for America.”

AD

AD

Buttigeig brushed off the criticism in an interview released Monday with host Peter Hamby of the Snapchat series “Good Luck America.

“I get it — he needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,” Buttigieg said of O’Rourke.

He also suggested some of his rivals’ ambitious plans are not politically viable. “My focus right now is on getting something done,” Buttigieg said. “I just don’t think we should wait to have a fight over confiscation when we can win on background checks and assault weapons bans and red-flag laws right now.”

But Buttigieg’s use of the word “confiscation” irked two other Democratic primary candidates, who accused him of using right-wing talking points on guns.

AD

“Calling buyback programs ‘confiscation’ is doing the NRA’s work for them, @PeteButtigieg — and they don’t need our help,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said on Twitter Tuesday.

AD

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) added, “Leaving more than 5 million assault weapons on the street isn’t a ban, it’s a Band-Aid.”

O’Rourke leveled another charge. “Pete can belittle the grass roots; he can call buybacks a ‘shiny object.’ He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people each year. Those people deserve action. I’ll be fighting for them,” he tweeted.

The “grass roots” comment referred to yet another spat among the Democrats, one that arose after Warren vowed last week to eschew big-dollar donors if she is the Democratic presidential nominee.

AD

Buttigieg knocked Warren’s fundraising strategy as one that would be ineffective in the general election, saying the Democratic nominee needs to have “the full spectrum of support” to go against someone as well-financed as President Trump.

AD

“My competitors can go with whatever strategy they like, but we’re going to make sure that we have the resources to compete, because we are going up against the sitting president of the United States,” Buttigieg told Hamby. “He has tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back, and we’re not going to beat him with pocket change.”

The candidates have occasionally targeted each other before this, including an attack by Harris on Biden on racial issues at the first debate. But the recent sniping appears to mark a new phase in a race that has largely been characterized by a unified Democratic field going after Trump.

AD

Buttigieg’s campaign said he was not leveling personal attacks, only highlighting his policy differences with others in the field.

But sometimes the attacks are fairly pointed. On health care, Buttigieg accuses Warren and Sanders of not trusting the American people to choose the right health care plans for themselves. Buttigieg’s plan would create a government-run “public option” but would not abolish private insurance, allowing people to choose between the two.

AD

A Buttigieg campaign official also pointed to Buttigieg’s high favorability ratings, as well as his progress in Iowa polls, and said they are not concerned Buttigieg’s more aggressive shift will cost him support.

AD

Warren, who has risen steadily in the polls and now leads in some of them, has avoided responding directly to Buttigieg. Hours before the debate, she doubled down on her fundraising strategy by saying she would no longer accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at “big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms or hedge funds,” a limit she had already set for fossil fuel and “big pharma” executives.

The Warren campaign said the rule was retroactive and that they intend to return donations that do not meet the new guidelines.

Warren’s campaign raised $24.6 million in the year’s third quarter, just shy of the $25.3 million raised by Sanders, who is also foregoing corporate and big-dollar donations. Buttigieg raised $19.1 million in the same period.

This is the point, after all. Campaigns raise money to spend money, and they spend money with the intent of improving their position in the field. We are admittedly still early enough in this election cycle that campaigns will want to sit on some cash as the primaries and caucuses approach. But campaigns are also spending, with leading candidates laying out more than $182 million over the three-month period from July 1 to Sept. 30. That’s about $2 million a day.

AD

AD

But, for what? What did that spending actually get them? Well, it depends on the candidate.

Take Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Her campaign reported spending just under $19 million over those three months. In return, Warren saw an impressive 9.6-point gain in the polls, according to the average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.

Here’s how her position in the polls shifted relative to where she was June 30. We’ve overlaid her performance on everyone else’s — with everyone’s spending indicated by the width of the line representing poll movement.

Compare Warren with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders’s position in the polls remained about even over those three months — and he paid several million dollars more than Warren for the privilege.

These charts don’t tell the whole story, of course. Spending and improvements in the polls aren’t directly linked, so it’s overly facile to expect more spending to lead to better polling. Nor do campaigns necessarily want to burn through money to see a big increase in the polls right now; for a campaign like that of former vice president Joe Biden, for example, spending less to remain in the lead, as he was on July 1, isn’t a terrible idea.

Except that’s not exactly what Biden did. His standing in the polls moved around a lot, which was in part a function of his relative polling strength coming into the period and in part a function of at least one iffy debate performance, but he ended up shedding a few points while nearly matching Warren’s spending.

It could have been worse: He could have been Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Her campaign surged at the beginning of the quarter after a strong debate against Biden, but ended up spending $14 million in the process of dropping a critical five points in the polling average.

You don’t always want to spend more just to gain a few points, but you certainly don’t want to do this.

Buttigieg, by the way, ended up having a quarter somewhat like Sanders’s. He spent a lot — $18 million — and didn’t really go anywhere. That’s actually worse for Buttigieg, though, since he was only at 6 percent in the average coming into the quarter.

And then there is billionaire activist Tom Steyer. No candidate raised more money last quarter, with Steyer pulling in nearly $50 million. Of course, about $48 million was his own. And he spent nearly all of it — to see his poll numbers soar by 0.6 points. It was enough to get him on the debate stage Tuesday, but it’s probably not going to do much more for him than that.

The exact opposite of Steyer was tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Yang only spent about $4 million, but he gained several points in the polls anyway. He’s not a front-runner by any stretch, but he’s gaining ground and not spending a ton of money doing so.

In fact, if we look at the change in polling as a function of money spent, Yang’s modest spending and modest poll improvement was about as efficient as Warren’s bigger gains and bigger buys. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro were somewhat less efficient, but still gained some ground. Harris, of course, stands out in her own way.

The moral of the story here is probably best exemplified by the last three columns on that graph. Steyer spent an outrageous amount and gained 0.01 points for every million dollars he spent. Warren gained about 0.5 points for each of the millions she spent — as did Yang, even though he spent far fewer millions.

In other words, how much you spend isn’t necessarily going to determine what you get in return. By extension, how much you raise, which determines how much you can spend, doesn’t either.

Unless you only raise $5. That does in fact determine how you’re going to fare moving forward.

Democratic rifts over policing Silicon Valley were on vivid display during last night's Ohio debate, with antitrust issues and President Trump's abundant use of Twitter taking center stage.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is leading in many polls, to join her in calling on Twitter to suspend Trump’s account for tweets she argued obstruct justice or incite violence, just hours after the company defended its policy of preserving newsworthy tweets that would otherwise violate its policy. Warren wouldn’t agree to the challenge, prompting Harris to take a swipe at the core of Warren’s messaging and suggest she has a double standard on corporate accountability.

“You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone,” Harris said.

Warren hit back by touting her recent pledge to turn down contributions over $200 from executives at large tech companies as many 2020 Democratic candidates -- including Harris -- have been aggressively fundraising in Silicon Valley.

“You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,” Warren said.

Tech issues got more air time last night than in any preceding Democratic face-off. The Democratic jabs at Facebook, Google, Amazon and Twitter were the clearest sign yet that the party's romance with Silicon Valley is waning. But the exchanges also underscored the lack of consensus among Democrats about a regulatory approach amid broad agreement tech companies have too much power, endanger consumers’ privacy and did not do enough to protect U.S. elections in 2016.

Warren’s plan to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon has emerged as the buzziest tech proposal on the campaign trail. But other Democrats don’t think antitrust action will solve the tech industry’s challenges -- and as Warren surges in the polls, they did more to highlight those distinctions onstage last night.

""As usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem,"" said Andrew Yang, a New York-based tech entrepreneur who has garnered attention in Silicon Valley for his positions on automation. “But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft.”

Yang said politicians need to focus on the issues facing the tech industry and come up with new solutions. He said antitrust action would amount to using 20th century tools to address 21st century problems. Later in the debate, Yang highlighted his support for a so-called “data dividend,” which would ensure consumers own their digital data and are paid for it.

Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke raised questions about whether it’s appropriate for the commander-in-chief to call for the breakup of individual companies.

“And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up,” O’Rourke said. “That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.”

O’Rourke said if elected, he would treat the companies as publishers. O'Rourke has previously proposed making changes to a key Internet law shielding tech platforms from liability for the content others post on their sites, covered by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He attacked Facebook’s recent decision to run a Trump campaign ad that made false claims.

“They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are,” he said.

Meanwhile, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who is the top Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said there’s a “startup slump” in the U.S.. She has previously introduced legislation to modernize antitrust laws and provide more resources to regulatory agencies charged with enforcing the laws.

“I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed,” she said.

But as tech regulation played a bigger role on the debate stage, some are questioning whether it's an issue that can move the needle with voters -- especially during a general election. Wealthy activist Tom Steyer said he supports breaking up or regulating monopolies but questioned whether that is where Democrats should be focusing their attention.

""But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy,"" he said. ""We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.""

Tom Nichols, a professor, wrote on Twitter that Steyer wasn't wrong, and he wondered if tech antitrust is an issue that would help Democrats secure votes. From Twitter:

BITS: Facebook decided not to fact check political ads, but it continue to haphazardly block those that violate a number of other advertising policies, such as using profanity, Ryan Mac and Zahra Hirji at BuzzFeed News report.

While Democrats continue to slam Facebook for its decision to not send political candidates' ads to fact-checkers, they've endured the brunt of the company's seemingly random enforcement of other advertising policies, Ryan and Zahra report. Of the 160 ads taken down this month, 117 belonged to former vice president Joe Biden. President Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Warren and Steyer also had ads removed.

The most common reason for ad removal was that the images used had “nonexistent functionality,” or in most cases, contained images of buttons that looked interactive but were not. At least one ad was removed for use of profanity.

“None of these political ads were rejected on the basis of being deemed false by our fact-checkers,” Facebook told BuzzFeed News. “They were removed for violating one or more of Facebook's other advertising policies, such as our policy against using fake buttons in ads.”

But BuzzFeed found that application of the policy has been inconsistent and that dozens of similar Biden ads remained up. Facebook removed 32 more Biden ads flagged by BuzzFeed after reporters reached out.

“Evidently Facebook views our graphic design choices as a greater threat to American democracy than Donald Trump's obscene lies,” Biden representative TJ Ducklo told BuzzFeed News. “They gladly profit off of these proven falsehoods, no matter the cost to our national discourse.”

NIBBLES: TikTok is trying to get ahead of growing criticism from Washington by adding two former U.S. lawmakers to its content moderation team.

Former congressman Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and congressman Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) will be part of a team from law firm K&L Gates assisting the Chinese-owned firm to create a committee to “review content moderation policies covering a wide range of topics, including child safety, hate speech, [and] misinformation” and “further increase transparency around our content moderation policies and the practices we employ to protect our community,” TikTok U.S. general manager Vanessa Pappas wrote in a news release.

Social media companies are under more pressure than ever before in Washington, but TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised additional concerns that the company is employing Beijing-mandated censorship abroad. Last week Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called for the U.S. government to investigate the company for national security concerns.

As recently as May, TikTok's global content-moderation guidelines banned criticism of the Chinese government, according to a report from Guardian. TikTok says the guidelines are no longer in use and that local teams shape content moderation guidelines, but has declined to say what those are in the United States. But as my colleague Tony Romm points out, TikTok's announcement does little to clarify what the company's moderation policies are.

we have been trying for many weeks to get TikTok to talk about its rules and standards for content. here's a blog post that raises more questions than answers https://t.co/MER16OdlgR — Tony Romm (@TonyRomm) October 15, 2019

BYTES: Teens are outsmarting Apple's army of engineers to get around Screen Time, a built-in tool that gives parents control of how much time kids spend on their phones, my colleague Reed Albergotti reports. Some experts are accusing Apple of luring parents seeking to limit their kids' screen time into a false sense of security.

Teens use a host of tricks to get around the feature: downloading software meant to exploit Apple security flaws, cracking their parents' passwords or manipulating bugs in the tool. For instance, teens get around restrictions on watching YouTube by watching it via iMessage. One mother found her 14-year-old son could make Screen Time stop working by repeatedly turning the phone on and off . Apple acknowledged in a customer service chat that her son had found a known bug, but didn't tell her if it planned to fix it.

“These are not rocket science, backdoor, dark web sort of hacks,” says Chris McKenna, founder of the Internet safety group Protect Young Eyes. “It blows me away that Apple hasn’t thought through the fact that a persistent middle school boy or girl can bang around and find them.” McKenna argues that Apple, with its large profits and expertise, should be able to put a stop to the long list of loopholes. Other experts alleged that Apple limits the functionality of other apps that might provide parents an alternative means of controlling their children's device use.

Apple spokeswoman Michele Wyman told Reed in a statement that Apple is “committed to providing our users with powerful tools to manage their iOS devices and [is] always working to make them even better.” Wyman did not comment on specific bugs and workarounds or the speed at which Apple fixes them.

As the Democratic candidates offer plan after plan, many are promising single-handed presidential action — rather than new laws that must be pushed through a sluggish Congress — to combat the nation’s big problems.

AD

That trend was particularly evident at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas Wednesday, where almost every candidate who spoke has promised some kind of executive action to bolster gun control.

AD

“Durable reform requires legislation — but right now legislation is impossible,” Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, wrote in releasing her gun plan in August. “Why? A virulent mix of corruption and abuse of power.”

The unilateral approach in some ways echoes President Trump’s strategy, even as Democrats increasingly label him an authoritarian. The Democrats’ policies would not amplify presidential power to the extent that Trump has sought to, but they do reflect a more president-centric approach to governing, a feature that’s become central to Trump’s tenure.

AD

While the question of presidential authority is now at center stage, the popularity of executive action in both parties began growing years ago, analysts say, driven by a growing tension between voters demanding dramatic change and a Congress increasingly paralyzed by partisanship and polarization.

AD

The Democratic hopefuls whose message is more revolutionary — Warren, Sanders, a senator from Vermont, and perhaps Harris, a senator from California — are emphasizing executive action more than those who foresee a return to bipartisan cooperation. In some ways, the issue is drawing a line between candidates, such as former vice president Biden, who see Trump as an aberration, and those who believe the days of bipartisan comity may not return any time soon.

Some lawmakers warn that the trend could distort the balance of powers. Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, is among those arguing that the legislative process, cumbersome though it may be, forces the parties to work together in ways that benefit the country.

AD

“[The Constitution] says you have to get a consensus to get anything done,” he told reporters in June. “And if you can’t get a consensus, guess what? Power flows to the president, and abuse of power takes place.”

AD

Regarding the Democrats, he added, “The idea that we’re going to come along and do the same thing [Trump] did? Not on my watch.”

But even Biden’s platform includes promises such as “on day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach” to tackle climate change.

Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., made a slightly different argument against executive action at that gun control forum Wednesday when he argued that gun control is among those issues “too important to be left to the whim of an individual president.”

AD

“Because an executive action can be reversed — and because an overwhelming majority of American people want this to get done anyway — I really feel that legislation is the best way forward,” he said.

Presidents dating to George Washington have used executive action, some to seismic effect. Franklin D. Roosevelt used his powers to implement key parts of the New Deal. Harry S. Truman’s Executive Order 9981 integrated the U.S. Armed Forces. Both had faced congressional opposition that precluded the passage of legislation to achieve their goals.

AD

“As long as you have a divided government, you’ll have executive action,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and now directs the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. “You can think of it as poor man’s legislation.”

AD

But in recent years, executive action has become an increasingly common substitute for legislation. Presidents often say they’re being forced to act because of Congress’s paralysis. As the Senate and House have become more polarized, they have struggled to enact major bills — prompting presidential edicts on issues such as immigration and health care.

The result can be a whiplash, where each new president enacts sweeping policies only to have them abruptly reversed when the opposition takes over. That’s been most evident in the much-reversed “global gag rule,” a provision banning foreign organizations that get U.S. aid from providing abortions or talking about them.

AD

“A Democrat comes in and says, ‘Yes, we will give foreign aid to entities that perform abortions.’ . . . The Republicans come in and they say, ‘No, we’re not doing that,’ ” Kamarck said. “So things like abortion become like a ping-pong ball.”

AD

The ping-pong balls will probably increase, if Democratic rhetoric on the campaign trail is any indication. In the last debate, Harris was asked about Biden’s charge that she and others were following Trump’s damaging example by promising sweeping presidential actions, some of which might not be constitutional.

Harris didn’t directly rebut the criticism. But talking to reporters at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention last month, she spoke of Congress’s failure to tackle “some of the longest-standing issues that are challenging our country.”

“If the United States Congress fails to act, absolutely I’m prepared to take executive action,” she said. “And that will be no different than previous presidents of the United States.”

AD

AD

In contrast, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who like Biden touts himself as a centrist who can work with Republicans, sees limits to what executive action can achieve, because by definition it shuts out the opposition.

“I think that executive orders can play a critical role,” Bullock said. “But you can’t assume you’re going to lead for four years — if you’re actually going to lead — just by executive action. . . . You’re not going to be able to substantially and sustainably move things forward if it’s just by executive order.”

Harris, saying “elections matter,” argues that immediate corrective action will be needed after Trump leaves office. Many Democrats consider the Trump presidency a crisis that requires an emergency response, and they’ve been frustrated as the president uses his powers to do things such as transfer funds to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier or enact rules aimed at weakening the Affordable Care Act.

AD

AD

Harris and other candidates often say they will ask Congress to pass certain bills and will issue an executive order only if it fails to do so.

But while the candidates often talk about issuing executive actions as though it’s like waving a magic presidential wand, the reality is more complicated. For all their reach and impact, executive orders only cover the activities of the federal government and its workforce, and they can take time to implement.

Harris’s proposed order expanding background checks on gun buyers, for example, would not instantly change the system. Instead, it would direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to change its interpretation of the current law requiring gun dealers to conduct background checks.

By directing ATF to classify as “dealers” even those who sell as few as five guns a year for profit, Harris would significantly expand the number of people covered. That would have a big effect — but the next GOP president could undo Harris’s action immediately upon taking office.

AD

The fight over executive action has been brewing for some time, as each new president pushes the envelope a little further. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Democrats excoriated President George W. Bush for his expansion of national security powers.

Obama then issued 276 executive orders in his eight years in office. That was fewer than other recent two-term presidents, but Republicans criticized the scope of Obama’s actions, such as establishing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — a sweeping bid to end the deportation of those brought to the United States illegally as children.

When Trump took office, he seized on executive orders with particular gusto, staging televised signing ceremonies to suggest bold action on promises such as banning travel from some Muslim countries.

As Trump has tested the limits of presidential power, parts of his orders have been found unconstitutional, and some are still being litigated. Trump, propelled to office by voters looking to shake up the system, has issued 125 executive orders since his inauguration, according to the Federal Register.

Now it’s Democratic voters who are demanding immediate change, suggesting that for all their temporariness and shaky status, the appeal of executive actions continues to resonate with a restless electorate."

Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) speaks to constituents during a town hall meeting on Wednesday. (Mary Altaffer/AP)

NEW YORK — It was supposed to be a “commuting town hall,” with questions and answers about the cost of getting around and out of Staten Island. But Rep. Max Rose dealt with “the i-word” right away.

“To some of you, I'm sure all of this seems like the same old nonsense,” said Rose, one of 31 Democrats, and 21 freshman Democrats, whose district was carried by Donald Trump in 2016. He bemoaned Democrats who wanted to impeach Trump “before they took the oath of office” and Republicans who'd become “deaf, dumb, and blind” as the president's legal team flouted subpoenas.

“While the president of the United States may be willing to violate the Constitution to get reelected, I will not,” Rose said. “That's why I intend to fully support this impeachment inquiry and follow these facts where they lead us.”

Until he spoke those words, Rose had been the only New York City Democrat in Congress who did not support the inquiry. Most of the crowd, more than 100 people packed into a Jewish Community Center, burst into applause. One constituent, holding up printouts from the late Lyndon LaRouche's website, stood up to challenge Rose; he was quickly shouted down. In New York and in other town halls held at the start of this two-week congressional recess, Democrats who have endorsed the impeachment inquiry have encountered more attaboys than jeers — until they go online, where Republican groups have been portraying swing-district Democrats as hateful and unhinged.

“This is a huge deal for our country,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin told constituents in East Lansing, Mich., on Wednesday. “This is only the fourth time in our history that we will go through this. And I do not do it with a light heart. What I would ask everyone, whether you agree or disagree with the decision, is that we treat it with the seriousness that it deserves.”

Resistance from Republican constituents has been visible but small. A half-dozen protesters gathered outside of Slotkin's town hall, holding signs with messages like “He won, get over it.” The crowd was only slightly larger at a protest of Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan, who like Slotkin had flipped a “red” district, albeit one that had been trending away from Republicans. There were some shouts of “hearsay” when Rep. Antonio Delgado met constituents in New York; one voter accused him of mouthing Democratic talking points when he said he took no pleasure in the possibility of impeachment.

“The statute makes it pretty clear that it is a crime to solicit anything of value from a foreign national when seeking office or for an electoral purposes,” Delgado said. “That is the letter of the law.”

The resistance, so far, is a fraction of what Republicans confronted in the summer of 2017, when they were working to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It's quieter than what Democrats faced in 2009, when the ACA was being debated amid false rumors that it would lead to national bankruptcy or “death panels” for the elderly.

What's unfolding instead is a hardening of partisan attitudes, with Republican voters irritated but not mobilized and Democratic voters showing up with thanks. Staten Island Republicans did not organize around Rose's town hall, and his leading Republican opponent kept her criticism to a tweet. (It used the word “socialism” twice, with a reference to a violinist and socialist activist who is challenging Rose in the 2020 primary.) Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) fielded just two impeachment questions at her Allentown town hall Wednesday; voters, she said, were mostly either thanking her or focusing on other issues.

“So far in the district, I’ve heard absolutely nothing,” Wild said, when asked whether her constituents are asking about impeachment. “Crickets.”

Democrats were far more vocal ahead of the Rose town hall, with groups that had worked for Rose in 2018 warning that it would be harder for him to excite them if he wholly rejected impeachment. After the event — which, as advertised, focused on transportation as soon as the impeachment statement was over — some said they were surprised that the congressman didn't get a protest.

“I thought there'd be more people angry at him,” said Alan Walters, 73, who had voted for Rose and came to support him Wednesday. “We live in contentious times.”

“I don't even want to talk about politics on Facebook because it's so divisive,” said Beverly Walters, 71.

Behind the confident ad buys — the Republican National Committee was running anti-Rose spots days before he actually endorsed the impeachment inquiry — polling doesn't suggest a rebellion brewing against swing-state Democrats. A polling memo released Thursday by the National Republican Congressional Committee and designed to rattle Democrats, found that 44 percent of voters in targeted seats, many of them places where Trump had won, nonetheless supported the impeachment inquiry. Public polling has found a surge toward support for an inquiry since a whistleblower first revealed that the president had leaned on Ukraine's president for dirt on the Biden family; nationally, there is far more enthusiasm about impeachment than there ever was for the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton.

While Democratic messaging has stuck to the line set by Nancy Pelosi — focus on the domestic agenda, take no glee — Republican messaging portrays a country being ripped apart. “Rather than spending his time in office accomplishing anything for his constituents, Max Rose would rather waste the next year on another pointless fishing expedition, trying to impeach the president his constituents elected in the 2016 election,” Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House GOP's super PAC, said after Rose's Wednesday night announcement.

But Rose had talked about impeachment for just seven of the town hall's 68 minutes; he ended it by informing the crowd that he had to talk to the reporters in the room, who were focused on “the i-word.” Surrounded by cameras, Rose had the most fun answering a question about the GOP's political strategy in Staten Island.

“I am not concerned at all by the NRCC or anyone that wants to try and challenge me because they already tried once, and we kicked their a--,” he told reporters after the town hall. “Guess what? That’s exactly what is going to happen again. They have been absolute jokes. They will continue to be jokes. And I look forward to beating them by an incredible margin.”

DEMS IN DISARRAY

On Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders supporters jumped onto a call with campaign manager Faiz Shakir. There was nothing but good news: More than 1 million donors, more than 3 million phone calls, at least 10 million voter contact attempts.

“Right now, we have a lot of corporate media who have been trying to deride this campaign, to dismiss this campaign, to write it off and suggest that it was all over,” Shakir said. “They were writing the obituaries, and, sadly for them, it has not turned out like that.”

At that moment, Sanders had been addressing around 250 voters in Las Vegas, when he asked for a chair, telling the crowd it had been a “long day.” The next morning, the Sanders campaign announced that the senator had gotten medical attention after the event; “he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted.”

There is not much precedent for what has happened to the Sanders campaign — it is organizing faster than before in early primary states, but its candidate is off the trail, and an Iowa ad buy has been postponed. Three years ago, Hillary Clinton scrapped some campaign events after a fainting spell resulting from pneumonia, which her campaign had not disclosed until the incident. At the time, Clinton was already the Democratic nominee for president, but the health scare sparked such panic that Donna Brazile, the acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, would later reveal that she considered setting in motion a process to replace Clinton with Joe Biden.

But just as the Democratic Party's apparatus isn't set up to defend a candidate who's not yet the nominee — whether it's Joe Biden from the president's attacks or Sanders, who has received well wishes from his competitors all week. (Elizabeth Warren's campaign even sent the Sanders team dinner.) On Thursday, the Sanders campaign announced that the senator would recover in time for the Oct. 15 debate outside Columbus, Ohio. His wife, Jane Sanders, said that he was “up and about” and would soon head home to Burlington, Vt., from Las Vegas.

“Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone,” Jane Sanders wrote in a statement. “His doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures.”

Apart from the canceled ad buy, and a few events, nothing has changed in the Sanders campaign's strategy this week. Still, that strategy, as laid out in the call, assumes a Democratic primary that is missing most other candidates.

“If you ask people around the country, what's one thing you know about Bernie Sanders, they're often going to tell you Medicare-for-all or taking on the elite special interests in this country,” Shakir said. “The other candidate, Joe Biden: What is his argument resting on? When you go around and you ask people, “What is one thing you know about Joe Biden,” the answer you often get back is, 'he was the vice president to Barack Obama.' I think as his record gets more exposed — how he's been favoring trade deals that have hurt the working class, how he supported the Iraq War and has a mythology of how he opposed the Iraq War, how he's been fundraising at the altar of the rich — I think it is going to be very hard for him to go up against Donald Trump.”

Warren, who has led Sanders in some polls of early states, was not mentioned at all. The conversation about “which candidate can beat Donald Trump” was limited to Biden and Sanders. When Sanders returns to the trail, he'll jump right back into an argument about electability, with a new issue — a brief health scare — that has historically caused Democrats to panic.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest news on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Tom Steyer, “Together.” The billionaire is best known among Democrats for his two-year campaign to start impeaching President Trump. He has since stepped away from Need to Impeach, but it's still on the air, including a new buy in Iowa, and Steyer is also on the air reminding Iowans of how he signed up 8 million people on an impeachment petition. ""Millions of voices demanding accountability, making change happen,"" a narrator says. This theme, that Steyer spent big and organized when politicians couldn't win, has run through all of his Iowa advertising; the news cycle gave him a fresh hook.

Michael Bennet, “2010.” The senator from Colorado introduced himself to Iowans as a critic of Medicare-for-all. His new spot accentuates the positive: He was in the Senate to support the Affordable Care Act, was warned that it could cost him his first election (after being appointed to the Senate seat), and backed it anyway. “I didn't win two swing-state elections by apologizing for Obamacare or making empty promises,” he says. Joe Biden has talked less about the risks it took to pass the ACA than about the vision of President Barack Obama; Bennet, by linking himself to the 2010 vote, continues to portray himself as the Democrat who learned something from the Obama-year defeats.

Did Joe Biden pressure Ukraine not to investigate his son? (Monmouth, 1,161 adults)

Probably did — 43%

Probably did not — 37%

Don’t know — 20%

As the president continues to recast the Ukraine story as a simple question about corruption — he has now called for multiple nations to investigate Biden — his base has followed along faithfully. Thirty-nine percent of voters polled believe that Trump deserves reelection, and a slightly higher number of them believe that the former vice president probably acted wrongly. The question is favorable to Trump’s framing, but the quiet Democratic worry about Biden (or any other Democrat) is that the president can change the discussion around them by throwing as many accusations as Fox News will air.

South Carolina, the first in a wave of southern states that vote over a few weeks in February and March, is frequently described as Joe Biden's firewall state: If things get sloppy in the first three states, he can recover and build up a delegate lead in places where black voters dominate Democratic primaries. Here, Warren leads Biden among white voters by a 29 to 22 margin; Biden leads the field with black voters, who give him 46 percent of their support to 10 percent for Harris, 9 percent for Warren and 8 percent for Sanders.

The California pollster's July survey got a lot of attention for affirming the story line at the time: Joe Biden seems to be taking on water as Kamala Harris surged. Its new numbers add to the teetering pile of bad news for Harris; it's also good for Sanders, who maintains his leads with young voters and Latino voters in the big primary state where he spent the most time. (Sanders's Hail Mary play at the end of the 2016 primary was to win California and move “superdelegates” away from Hillary Clinton. He lost the state by only seven points.) But the poll was conducted before the Ukraine saga began and long before Sanders's health scare, two story lines that have yet to be reflected in polls.

2020

Joe Biden. In nearly every speech, the former vice president tells his crowds that the 2020 election can’t just be about the president. “Everybody knows who Donald Trump is,” he says. “It’s time to tell people who we are.” It’s a way to assuage worries that he, like Hillary Clinton, would chase the president through every twisty news cycle; it’s a way to project confidence that if voters got to hear him and Trump lay out their agendas, Trump would lose badly.

But on Wednesday, Biden turned a stop in Reno into a response to Trump, rebutting a TV ad that falsely accuses the former vice president of leaning on Ukraine to stop a prosecutor from investigating his son, Hunter Biden.

“You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get,” Biden said. “We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pressing them to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do his job with someone who, at the time, we hoped would finally crack down on corruption. Trump, on the other hand, was secretly putting at risk our national security to pursue a personal political vendetta against me because he does not want to run against me.”

It was the third time that Biden had replaced the stump speech with an address about Trump. The first, a June speech in Iowa, embraced the contrast between himself and the president, who was speaking to donors two hours away. The second, an August speech in another part of Iowa, attacked Trump's “vacant-eyed mouthing” of talking points about white supremacy after the mass shooting in El Paso.

A goal shared in each of these speeches was elevating Biden above the other Democratic candidates: He was the one who Trump worried about, and the only one with the stature to respond to him.

But in Reno, Biden — who’s often talked about Republicans experiencing an ""epiphany"" once Trump leaves office — singled out the president’s party for criticism. If that keeps up, it would be a small but vital change to the argument Biden is making

President Trump. He spent Thursday in the Villages, a Florida retirement community, ostensibly to promote an executive order that promoted private plans within Medicare Advantage. The event turned into a riff on Medicare-for-all, with the president insisting that Democrats would “devastate” the health-care system and adding that they were working on their “impeachment crap” because he kept winning.

Cory Booker. He repackaged a suite of plans to “cut child poverty by two thirds,” ahead of a campaign trip to Iowa. They include the Rise Credit, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit; increasing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program maximum by 30 percent; and turning Temporary Assistance for Needy Families into a block grant for states.

Beto O’Rourke. Starting at the Giffords gun forum in Las Vegas and continuing with a BuzzFeed interview, he accused Pete Buttigieg of curtailing his gun plan because he was afraid of blowback. “He probably wants to get to the right place, but is afraid of doing the right thing right now,” O’Rourke said onstage. He expanded on those remarks afterward: “I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll testing and focus-group driving, and triangulating, and listening to consultants before you arrive at a position.”

Steve Bullock. He’s among the Democrats not taking the stage at this weekend's SEIU gathering in Los Angeles; instead, he's spending the weekend in Charleston and Columbia, S.C.

Tom Steyer. He plugged $2.7 million more into Need to Impeach, as it goes up in key 2020 states with Senate races, urging Republicans to listen to evidence if impeachment leads to the trial of the president.

Tulsi Gabbard. She criticized Kamala Harris for urging Twitter to suspend the president’s account, telling Fox News: “I will stand up for every American’s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech.”

COUNTDOWN

Rating: (1.5 stars)

Disney’s revisionist “Maleficent” took the “Sleeping Beauty” story that inspired the studio’s own 1959 animated classic and turned it upside down, right on the horned head of its titular protagonist. In that live-action retelling — a sort of supervillain origin story — the evil sorceress Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) became, as described in the 2014 film, both hero and villain. Aided and abetted by digitally-enhanced cheekbones that looked sharp enough to fillet a fish, Jolie delivered a deliciously complex, even sympathetic portrait of a fairy scorned so badly by a faithless lover that the betrayal twisted her morals.

A new sequel, “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” picks up, more or less, where the first film left off: in the never-never-land known as the Moors, a CGI paradise now ruled by the former Sleeping Beauty, Aurora (Elle Fanning), and overrun with mythical critters straight out of some version of Tolkien Lite.

Aurora’s love interest from the earlier film (Harris Dickinson, replacing Brenton Thwaites) is still in the picture, and, as the film opens, this anodyne Prince Charming — er, Phillip — has just proposed marriage to Aurora.

It’s a political union that will bring together two worlds at tenuous odds: the Moors and its magical denizens, and the human kingdom of Ulstead, ruled by Phillip’s mother and father. It’s also a marriage of love, assuming you’re willing to suspend disbelief enough to entertain the notion that the young actors have any actual chemistry. (They don’t. But then again, there’s no such thing as Dew Fairies, either.)

The nuptials entail a meeting of the in-laws over dinner, a social requirement attended by Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) and King John (Robert Lindsay) and Maleficent, who virtually raised Aurora. (Aurora calls her “godmother.” Maleficent, for her part, calls Aurora “beastie.” It’s kind of cute.)

Such get-togethers are always awkward, but in this case it’s especially so. Maleficent, as a fairy — or Fey — is not trusted by Ingrith, and before dessert has been served, all hell breaks loose. Soon there is out-and-out war between the Feys, the hitherto-exiled race from which Maleficent has descended, and the Ulsteaders.



From left, Elle Fanning, Angelina Jolie and Sam Riley in “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.” (Jaap Buitendijk/Walt Disney Motion Pictures)

Unfortunately, there is no central relationship here to replace the one in “Maleficent,” a poignant dynamic that centered on the mixed feelings — hate gradually giving way to love — between Maleficent and Aurora. In its place, “Mistress of Evil” (whose title, you will discover, does not refer to Maleficent) substitutes the schematics of military battle for character development.

It’s a big and busy film, characterized by a focus on fighting and weaponry. If “Maleficent” was dark — and it was — “Mistress” is positively black. In a troubling scene that evokes unfortunate associations with concentration-camp gas chambers, all manner of adorable characters are rounded up and massacred with a toxic, powdery red poison. Think twice about taking very young children — or even some susceptible adults — to this at-times shocking, if less than graphic, gloom-and-doom fest.

But the worse sin is: It’s boring.

Disney obviously spent a lot of money on special effects. The screen virtually overflows with computer-generated wizardry and cutesy flora and fauna, to a degree that cloys. And the war sequences are tedious and numbing.

But unlike the first film, there’s no one to care about. And Jolie, as good as she is, comes off as just another complicated costumed crusader, one more comic book baddie, like Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck, misshapen by society and bent by resentment. Oh there’s a happy ending — of course there is — but it feels tacked on: an afterthought slapped onto the last 10 minutes some juvenile edition of “Joker.”"

So-so adaptation isn’t spooky, kooky enough; a few scares.

“The Addams Family” is the latest take on the popular characters who’ve already been the subject of cartoons, a classic TV show, and two early ’90s movies. It’s not quite as macabre as its live-action predecessors, but there’s still plenty of dark humor, an emphasis on violence and weapons and incidents in which townspeople raise arms against the eerie Addamses. Insult language includes words like “freaks,” “monsters” and “lemmings,” as well as a few Addams family spins on endearments or encouragements (like “do your worst” and “kick your father good night”). As always, Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) are presented as caring parents who are very much in love; the movie also promotes acceptance, teamwork and empathy. Chloe Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard co-star as Addams children Wednesday and Pugsley. (87 minutes)

Powerful queens go to war in intense, dark fantasy sequel.

“Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” is the even-darker sequel to “Maleficent,” Disney’s live-action retelling of “Sleeping Beauty.” After Aurora (Elle Fanning) becomes engaged to Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson), his mother, Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), threatens not only Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) but all the Moorfolk. The fantasy violence is more intense here than in the first film: Frightening sequences include war, mass destruction and a near genocide of the Fey (think “Avengers: Infinity War”-like deaths). Characters are seriously injured, and one beloved character sacrifices herself. At one point it seems like no one will get to live, much less find a “happily ever after.” Characters drink wine, and romance includes a few kisses, embraces and some longing looks — but it’s the love between mother and daughter that’s really at the core of this story. Themes also include empathy, collaboration and teamwork, as well as the possibility of reinvention and rediscovery. (118 minutes)

Cheerfully vulgar, gory sequel lives up to the original.

“Zombieland: Double Tap” is the horror-comedy sequel to “Zombieland,” set 10 years after the first movie. It’s a worthy companion piece to the original, rather than a pale imitation, and the characters’ chemistry is as strong as ever. But iffy/mature material makes it best for older teens and up. Expect extreme (albeit comical) zombie violence and gore, with guns and shooting, blood sprays, severed heads, destroyed body parts and a monster truck running over hordes of zombies. Language is also strong, with multiple uses of “f---,” “s---,” “c---sucker,”

“motherf----r,” and more. Characters kiss, and there are two sex scenes; they’re more suggested than shown, but sex noises are heard through walls. There are suggestions of drinking (bottles/beer cans shown), and a bag of pot is shown, with spoken references to smoking pot. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin all return. (99 minutes)

He has been under attack from President Trump, who employs his children and makes money off overseas properties, accusing him and his son Hunter over Hunter’s work on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden has struggled to aggressively respond. At Tuesday’s debate, he was able to do that, making clear he and his son did nothing wrong while calling out Trump as the most corrupt president in history. His answer was not as succinct as it might have been, highlighting that others in the race may have a sharper tongue, but to his great advantage, the first block of the debate saw every candidate attacking Trump.

More effectively, Biden also was able to take a shot at Trump’s foreign policy ignorance and showcase his success in beating the National Rifle Association. His strongest moment of the night might have been his defense of his age, arguing he has experience (“with it comes wisdom,” he said) and needs no on-the-job training. He said with much justification that he was the only one to get big things done in the past. He was also successful in piling on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for being “vague” on taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all and zinging Sanders for supporting a hugely expensive health-care plan.

Aside from a few well-placed jabs from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren has faced no real criticism from her rivals despite her climb to the top of the polls. While she started by hitting a softball out of the park with an easy question about whether impeachment was necessary, she was on the receiving end of constant criticism from moderates who more than held their own.

Buttigieg laid into Warren most aggressively for refusing to say whether taxes will go up to pay for her Medicare-for-all plan and for ignoring how unwise it would be to attempt this in a country as divided as ours, especially when alternatives are available. The more times she refused to answer the question on taxes, the worse it got. Even more destructive than holding onto a plan that, as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said, gives Republicans a talking point (socialism!), she looked slippery, a bad image for someone saying she is the person to bring integrity into government. Even Andrew Yang got in a shot, explaining that Warren’s wealth tax idea has been tried and repealed in other countries when the plans didn’t work.

In the long run, Warren’s bigger problem might be her answer seemingly to agree with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) on Syria and arguing in favor of getting all U.S. troops out of the Middle East (“I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East,” Warren said). She actually got to Sanders’s left on foreign policy, obliterating a contrast with Trump that other candidates can exploit.

AD

Finally, she awkwardly thanked President Barack Obama for helping to pass legislation for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, pointedly refusing to credit Biden, who had just explained his role in rounding up votes. It was not a classy moment, eliciting some negative murmurs from the crowd.

Overall, Buttigieg had his best debate, not only cutting Warren down to size on hiding her tax plan but giving a shoutout to the Midwest, where Democrats too often ignored deindustrialization. He also smartly stressed the need to look forward to the day after Trump leaves office when serious problems will persist. Buttigieg particularly shined on foreign policy, explaining that a small contingent of troops was keeping the Kurds from being slaughtered. He was impassioned and on the money when it came to U.S. leadership in the world. (“You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility is in tatters,” he said.) And on gun safety, he lit into former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.) for taking attention off background checks with his plan to forcibly confiscate assault weapons, shoving back on his insinuation that Buttigieg lacked courage on guns. (“I don’t need lessons from you in courage, political or personal,” Buttigieg said.) He wisely backed off a court-packing plan, supporting a review of a variety of reform ideas now circulating. He certainly showed that to be a moderate doesn’t mean to lack passion.

Sanders had a single job: Show he was the picture of health with the stamina to wage a vigorous campaign and then govern. He did that. He was feisty and slyly got in a dig at Warren for saying we should be honest about raising taxes. He was sincere and heartfelt in thanking Americans for their good wishes. Sanders even managed to get in a sound argument on foreign policy opposing Trump for cutting and running in Syria, making the United States an unreliable ally.

AD

AD

Along with Buttigieg, Klobuchar may be one of the best contestants to fill Biden’s moderate lane if the former vice president stumbles. She had her best debate to date as well. Recognizing that the primary is also a commander-in-chief test for the would-be nominees, she excoriated Trump for making “Russia great again,” and laid into Yang for suggesting there was some moral equivalence between Russia and the United States. She also hit Warren on Medicare-for-all, saying there is a difference between “a plan and a pipe dream.” She also pushed back on the Massachusetts senator for accusing others of defending billionaires. And she made a fine argument about championing antitrust legislation to aid in breaking up Big Tech and gave a preview of how she’d take on Trump on abortion. Her ending tribute to her friend, the late senator John McCain, was a moment of genuine emotion.

For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and O’Rourke, the debate offered one more chance to distinguish themselves from their nonviable and in many cases unserious rivals. Harris had a mixed outing, beginning with a forceful statement about impeachment, denouncing Trump for “selling out” the country and getting a hearty round of applause for raising access to abortion. She floundered badly, however, when she kept insisting Twitter should kick Trump off its platform. O’Rourke had a rough debate, in particular getting knocked around for his plan to institute mandatory buybacks of assault weapons.

The debate vividly demonstrated just how fluid the race really is. Rather than a single front-runner, we now see four or five candidates who have the capacity to rise to the occasion on any given day. The winner may be the candidate of that bunch who peaks just as the voting begins.

AD

Each of these winner-take-all games went into extra innings. The Nats won theirs, 7-3, on Howie Kendrick’s 10th-inning grand slam; the Senators again went small-ball — hitting two doubles while capitalizing on two Giants errors to win their game, 4-3, in the 12th inning.

AD

And both games featured Washington starting pitchers earning redemption out of the bullpen after losing their first two decisions. In the Nats’ case, Patrick Corbin was a tough-luck loser in the series opener, giving up just one earned run in six innings as the bullpen and offense faltered in a 6-0 loss. In game 3, Corbin came out of the bullpen in the sixth inning with the Nats nursing a 2-1 lead. The Dodgers torched him for six runs in ⅔ of an inning, and the lefty was tagged with a blown save and a loss. As ESPN’s Eddie Matz put it, “Patrick Corbin caused a Nationals disaster.”

After two games, Corbin’s postseason ERA was an unsightly 9.45, but manager Dave Martinez showed faith in him in Game 5, bringing him in from the bullpen again, this time with the Nats trailing 3-1 and two outs in the seventh inning. Corbin struck out the dangerous Joc Pederson, and after the Nats tied the score in the top of the eighth, Corbin fanned two more in the bottom of the frame to preserve the tie.

AD

In the ’24 World Series, Walter Johnson also lost a tough opener, surrendering four runs in the Giants’ 12-inning, 4-3 victory. He was worse in a Game 5 defeat, giving up four earned runs in eight innings as the Giants took a three games to two lead in the series. After that game, Johnson, 36, said he would likely retire.

AD

But like Corbin, Johnson had a manager who still had his back. Two days later, old Griffith Stadium in Washington convulsed for several minutes after the Senators tied the score in the eighth inning, as fans threw confetti, ripped-up newspapers, hats and coats on the field.

Senators player-manager Bucky Harris had used only three pitchers to that point, but he didn’t hesitate to bring his ace right-hander from the bullpen in the ninth inning on just one day’s rest (there were no off days in that series). The move looked a little dicey at first, when Johnson surrendered a one-out triple to Frankie Frisch. But Johnson pitched out of trouble, then threw three more scoreless innings in relief to win the game.

AD

“Walter was my best bet,” Harris said after the game. “That’s why I put him in. Anyone who thought Walter was through was a fool. I knew he was all right.”

AD

The two games were connected in another important way. Although the Nats’ win ended on Wednesday night L.A. time, in D.C., it was already Thursday — and the 95th anniversary of the Senators’ Game 7 victory. Oct. 10, already a high-water mark in Washington baseball history, now has another important milestone in the city’s long baseball tradition.

The ’24 Senators and this year’s Nats have something else in common. Both were “due” for a championship. By 1924, every team in the American League had been to the World Series at least once except for the Senators and the lowly St. Louis Browns. When Washington mounted its unlikely march for the pennant that year, fans from around the country rallied around them, eager to see the young upstarts topple a Big Apple baseball duopoly. The three previous World Series had pitted the New York Yankees against the Giants.

AD

Generations of fans have come and gone since that first title. Perhaps the Nats, by capturing some of that ’24 magic, are ready to finally deliver a second one.

The Campaign

THE FRONT-RUNNER TREATMENT: It's clear that the 2020 Democrats see Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the one to beat.

As she surges in the polls, the Massachusetts senator took repeated hits from all sides at the Ohio debate on everything to how she'd pay for her Medicare-for-all plan to her tax-the-rich tough talk. But Warren emerged with a strong performance and spent the most time speaking out of the 12 candidates in the fourth debate.

Turning point: ""The tenor of the debate was the clearest sign yet that Warren’s ascendancy would force her campaign to grapple with the challenges of being the front-runner in a large and unwieldy Democratic field,"" our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa, Chelsea Janes and Matt Viser write.

our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa, Chelsea Janes and Matt Viser write. Warren ended the night with a more than six-minute lead on talking time, per our colleagues:

By the numbers: NBC News's Nigel Chiwaya tracked the attacks during the debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times. Warren was swiped at 16 times, more than anyone else.

For comparison: Democratic candidates attacked President Trump 38 times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell twice, Wall Street and corporations 25 times, and the “ultrarich” two times, per Chiwaya.

Swing batter, batter: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg both aggressively called out Warren for giving an evasive answer on whether Medicare-for-all will raise taxes on the middle class, which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had done just moments before.

“At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said. “And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.”

Klobuchar said. “And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.” Zing: “The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,” the Minnesota senator added of the plan Warren supports, which would largely do away with private health-care industry and provide everyone with government-sponsored care.

the Minnesota senator added of the plan Warren supports, which would largely do away with private health-care industry and provide everyone with government-sponsored care. “Well, we heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,"" Buttigieg said. “Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.""

Buttigieg said. “Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Even former vice president Joe Biden later chimed in: Warren's “being vague on the issue of — actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare-for-all.”

Warren, who instead stressed that overall costs for the middle class would go down under her plan, ultimately refused to acknowledge what Sanders said about the Medicare-for-all proposal that he authored: ""At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy,"" Sanders said.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke attacked Warren for “being punitive"" by pushing for a wealth tax on the richest Americans, saying she's ""pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.""

Warren's proposal for an annual tax on households with a net worth above $50 million has central to her campaign. O'Rouke said a wealth tax is just ""part of the solution.""

And Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) chastised Warren for not agreeing with her that Twitter should suspend Trump's account.

Even businessman Andrew Yang took a swing at Warren, who has asserted that automation is “a good story, except that it's not really true” and that bad trade policy is the principal reason for people might lose their jobs.

“Sen. Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation,” said Yang. “And they're smart. They see what's happening around them … Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.”

Warren got a “real dose of being a front-runner” tonight as her competitors piled on the jabs, notes @AlxThomp.

But Warren escaped relatively unscathed: She used the onslaught of attacks against her into an opportunity to cast her opponents as corporatists entrenched in the political system or as too “small-minded or timid for the moment,” as Toluse, Chelsea and Matt write.

Key quote: “Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren said. She attacked ""Washington insiders"" and ""people in our own party"" who believe that ""running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy.""

“Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren said. She attacked ""Washington insiders"" and ""people in our own party"" who believe that ""running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy."" She projected confidence she will be the nominee -- with a dig at Trump: ""Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.""

""Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with."" Warren's team embraced the criticisms as signs of ascendancy: Warren “has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,” her communications director wrote in an email. “She took heat tonight as a result of that momentum, but she stayed focused on what’s broken and how she plans to fix it with a government and an economy that works for the people. That’s how Elizabeth will win the nomination, beat Donald Trump and make big, structural change.”

There was perhaps no better snapshot of this than during a contentious exchange with Biden about the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The former veep stressed that he helped whip support for the agency in Congress: ""I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it.""

Shade: ""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren responded.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren responded. Biden cut off Warren's answer for a... compliment: ""You did a hell of a job in your job.""

And the debate is over.



BIG THEME: Attacks on Elizabeth Warren who has been rising in many polls.



We saw a number of tense exchanges including:



Warren & Sanders v Biden

Warren v Yang

Warren v Klobuchar

Warren v Buttigieg

Warren v O’Rourke

Warren v Gabbard

Warren v Harris — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) October 16, 2019

BIDEN PROBLEMS: Biden's answers, on the other hand, even on topics he had to know were coming, were sometimes garbled and lacking clear points.

He seemed to struggle in a question about his son Hunter Biden's work on the board of an energy company in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Many Democrats were looking for an aggressive takedown of Trump's baseless attacks -- instead Biden was on the defensive.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. ""I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate.""

Biden said. ""I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate."" Hunter Biden said in an interview on Tuesday that he showed ""poor judgment"" by becoming entangled in foreign business deals but not an ethical lapse. He promised to step away from foreign businesses if his father is elected.

The former veep didn't directly answer the moderator's question about why his son needs to do that now -- if it was OK before: ""The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption,"" Biden said. ""That's what we should be focusing on.""

""The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption,"" Biden said. ""That's what we should be focusing on."" Stumbles: ""Not only does he seem to no longer be the candidate his opponents fear most, he was again somewhat off his game,"" our colleague Aaron Blake recaps. ""He offered some odd figures on the middle-class costs of Medicare-for-all. He said 'expidentially' instead of 'exponentially.' He mixed up Iraq with Afghanistan.""

NEW: Biden's cash on hand is just under $9 million.



In comparison:



Sanders: $33.7 million on hand

Warren: $25.7 million on hand

Buttigieg: $23.4 million on hand

Harris: $10.5 million on hand — Michelle Ye Hee Lee (@myhlee) October 16, 2019

$$$: Biden's standing in the race received a further hit on Tuesday night: He was outraised significantly by all of his major primary rivals.

Biden's campaign, according to our colleagues Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy, ""struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months — spending money at a faster clip and having a smaller campaign war chest than his top competitors, according to new filings released Tuesday night.""

“The former vice president entered the final quarter of 2019 with significantly less cash on hand than other candidates who are leading in polls or fundraising. And his share of low-dollar donations — which can signal enthusiasm for his candidacy — was significantly lower.”

And his share of low-dollar donations — which can signal enthusiasm for his candidacy — was significantly lower.” By the dollars: "" The top fundraisers of the quarter were Sanders ($25.3 million); Warren ($24.7 million); Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. ($19.2 million); Biden ($15.7 million); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California ($11.8 million).""

Kamala Harris of California ($11.8 million)."" Response from the Biden camp: “The fundamental question about fundraising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told Michelle and Anu.

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE DEBATE:

Bernie is back: Sanders, who returned to the campaign trail for the first time since his heart attack just two weeks ago, showed that he's still feeling the Bern, by many accounts.

""I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,"" a feisty Sanders responded at one point. He did cut off CNN's Erin Burnett's question about his health to talk about the previous topic -- opioids. But his answer quickly diverged into an argument about what ""unfettered capitalism is doing to this country."" In short, it was vintage Bernie.

But his answer quickly diverged into an argument about what ""unfettered capitalism is doing to this country."" In short, it was vintage Bernie. And he got a solid boost offstage by scoring some major endorsements from the left flank: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will endorse the senator this weekend and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), another member of the so-called ""Squad,"" announced her support last night. ""The surprise endorsements are a political coup for Sanders, 78, who has been fading in the polls and faced growing questions about his age and health,"" our colleagues Sean Sullivan and David Weigel scoop.

Beto and Buttigieg get personal over guns: You knew it was coming, but boy was it a clash. Buttigieg pushed back on O'Rourke's mandatory buyback plan for assault weapons, calling the idea ""a shiny object."" In the end, Buttigieg landed what might be one of the most devastating lines we've heard thus far:

Amid a clash over Beto O'Rourke's proposed mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles, Pete Buttigieg tells O'Rourke, ""The problem isn’t the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" #DemDebate https://t.co/GnrM5echj6 pic.twitter.com/7nNDPqISqp — CNN (@CNN) October 16, 2019

While Castro brings up police violence: Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro said he has two problems with mandatory buybacks: ""Folks can't define it. And if you're not going door to door, then it's not really mandatory."" But it was how he connected the issue of gun violence to the recent death of a woman inside her Texas home that particularly resonated.

""Police violence is also gun violence,"" Castro said: ""In the places that I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth,"" Castro said. ""And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.""

""And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that."" Jefferson, who is black, was shot in her home by a white police officer through a closed window in the early hours of Saturday morning. The officer resigned on Monday and was later charged with murder.

Castro's answer was the most tweeted about moment of the night, according to Twitter.

Harris made sure abortion was not ignored this time: Harris took exception to the fact that the three hour debate in September failed to include a question about abortion or reproductive rights, Vox's Anna North reports. This time, she refused to wait for the moderators to bring it up:

Kamala Harris says there has been “not nearly one word” on the issue of women’s reproductive health during previous debates, even as there is a “full-on attack” on abortion access in some states. #DemDebate https://t.co/D9U4FPR3t2 pic.twitter.com/Z5VzUMWjgo — HuffPost (@HuffPost) October 16, 2019

Klobuchar seizes the moment: ""The Minnesota senator arguably made herself Warren’s chief foil in this debate, creating contrasts on taxes, Medicare-for-all and other issues,"" Aaron writes. ""At one point, she rejected the charge that she was creating a Republican talking point by pressing Warren on whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would raise taxes on the middle class. 'You are making Republican talking points right here in this room' by talking about getting rid of private insurance, Klobuchar charged. And she wasn’t wrong.""

She finished third in total speaking time: A remarkable achievement considering she is not even in the top-five in the RealClearPolitics national polling average where is currently tied for eighth with Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.). In Iowa, her best early state, she is only sixth.

And how can we knot bring it up?: Billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer just spent $47 million dollars on his campaign last quarter. But honestly, we're not convinced he owns more than one tie -- and it's red plaid:

Aides in the two offices have otherwise been at odds since the transcript was released, according to administration officials.”

What happened behind closed doors on the Hill: A State Department official told lawmakers that the administration’s Ukraine policy was stripped away from career diplomats and handed to the “three amigos” consisting of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, EU ambassador Gordon Sondland and special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, our colleagues Paul Kane, Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade report.

RUDY PUSHED TRUMP TO EJECT MUSLIM CLERIC: ""Giuliani privately urged President Trump in 2017 to extradite [Fethullah Gulen], a Turkish cleric living in exile in the United States, a top priority of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to multiple former administration officials familiar with the discussions,"" our colleagues Carol D. Leonnig, Ellen Nakashima, Josh Dawsey and Tom Hamburger scooped last night.

Rudy's efforts alarmed other officials: ""The former New York mayor brought up Gulen so frequently with Trump during visits to the White House that one former official described the subject as Giuliani’s 'hobby horse,'"" our colleagues write. ""He was so focused on the issue — 'it was all Gulen,' recalled a second former official — that White House aides worried that Giuliani was making the case on behalf of the Turkish government, former officials said.""

Every four years, the third fundraising quarter gives us a presidential primary gut check. We learn who has tapped out their biggest donors, who has succeeded in creating an online donor base, and which candidates are living up, or down, to their hype.

This quarter offered mixed news for both parties. Most of the Democrats running competitive presidential bids actually raised more than they had three months ago, breaking the old pattern from the days before massive online donations. Republicans, who say that the impeachment push fired up their base, have only a few days of the quarter to reflect that. They're raising less than many Democrats they want to beat, but they're in the hunt. And the left-wing Democrats who changed their party in 2018 have seen everything from breakout fundraising for new challengers to flops that will please the party leaders, who want as little disruption as possible on the way to 2020.

Trump led the field … but Democrats, combined, continued to outraise him. The president who once eschewed big fundraising events has continued to break records. As his campaign announced weeks ago, the reelection effort and its joint fundraising with the Republican National Committee combined for $125 million; the president's own campaign raised $97.8 million of that. The money has funded an ambitious grass-roots campaign operation, and increasingly it has been going to TV and digital ads designed to attract Trump-friendly (but infrequent) donors and to bash Joe Biden.

But for the second consecutive quarter, Democrats actually managed to raise more. Combined, the 17 candidates who are not self-funding their campaigns raised $119.3 million over the quarter. Tom Steyer, the self-funder, raised $2 million and put in more than $47 million of his own money. Even as the DNC continues to struggle to raise money, the party and its candidates are competitive with the incumbent president, a departure from what was happening at this point in 2003 and 2011, the last off-years when a president was seeking reelection.

Obviously, only one Democrat is going to get this nomination; maybe two of these Democrats will end up on the ticket, as happened in 2004 and 2008. Not everyone who threw a check to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is likely to become an excited Joe Biden donor, and vice versa. But the long legacy of 2016 is a growing number of Democrats ready to chip in small amounts to various candidates. That conditioning, which started after 2016, really matters; there are hundreds of thousands of liberals happily giving online when they see something they like. Sanders's campaign has made the most of it, as it's the only one that got more donors in the quarter than Trump's. Put together, the Democrats lapped the president with small donors.

Not many people are donating to the president's primary challengers. That might not be a surprise. After all, what kind of future in Republican politics awaits someone who donates to an anti-Trump campaign? But the combined fundraising haul for William Weld, Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh, three Republicans all with more than 20 years of political experience, was $647,000. If the three of them were running as a Democratic candidate, they'd be running 16th in the cash race, ahead of Tim Ryan (who raised $425,731) and Joe Sestak (who raised $374,000).

Joe Biden has a war chest problem. The former vice president has been flat in polling for the past few weeks, with little sign that the president's attacks on him have stuck. Why are Democrats increasingly worried about him? Because of his fundraising — fourth overall for the quarter ($15.7 million) with less cash on hand than four of his rivals. Sanders had $33.7 million left to spend; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had $25.7 million; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg had $23.4 million; and Sen. Kamala D. Harris had $10.5 million.

Biden had just $9 million in the bank, less than anyone who has led in the polls at this point in the recent history of Democratic primaries. Having sworn off “super PACs” — a collective Democratic decision that has limited big-money impact on the race — Biden has no independent air cover as the president attacks him. And he does not have the cushion that Hillary Clinton used in 2008 and 2016 to build robust post-Iowa operations for unexpectedly long primaries.

Embattled House Democrats are stacking up cash. There are 31 Democrats in the House whose districts were won in 2016 by Trump. Thirty of those Democrats are seeking reelection. Twenty-two of them support the impeachment inquiry. It's those 22 who have been under particular pressure from Republicans, who argue that they cannot run in 2020 saying they tried to find common ground.

But those 22 Democrats are seriously raking it in. Together they've raised more than $16 million, in districts that range from suburbs trending away from the president ($712,000 for New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill) to largely rural districts that trended away from Democrats in 2016 ($463,631 for Iowa's Abby Finkenauer). None of them got out-fundraised by Republican challengers, though some came close — possible opponents for Rep. Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and Rep. Max Rose of New York raised more than half a million dollars each.

Liberal Democratic challengers are doing well in safe seats — not swing seats. Left-wing groups such as Justice Democrats started this cycle with a big but strategic goal: Replace as many incumbents as possible in deep blue districts. They've largely filled out that slate, and their star candidates had strong quarters. Ohio's Morgan Harper raised $323,000, besting Rep. Joyce Beatty, who raised $247,323. (Beatty, like every incumbent under fire, leads the challenger in cash on hand.) Texas's Jessica Cisneros raised $310,000, while Rep. Henry Cuellar raised $376,000. Insurgent candidates don't expect to outraise incumbents — New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was lapped by Joe Crowley, on the way to beating him. But so far, they're competitive.

The same can't be said for challengers in races that Democrats are nervous about winning. In Colorado, John Hickenlooper raised $2.1 million over the quarter; his closest competitor in the primary, Andrew Romanoff, raised about one-quarter of that. That happens to be one of the states Democrats must win if they're to control the Senate in 2021, and there's not a ton of donor interest, yet, in a competitive primary.

It's the same story in other competitive Senate races. In Maine, where national Democrats have already endorsed legislator Sara Gideon as their challenger to Sen. Susan Collins, Gideon raised $3.2 million over the quarter. That wasn't just better than Collins — it was 30 times more than Betsy Sweet, her leading liberal challenger, who raised just $102,000. In Iowa, where Democrats have anointed real estate company president Theresa Greenfield, she raised $1.1 million, actually putting her ahead of Sen. Joni Ernst. Attorney Kimberley Graham, who's running as a Medicare-for-all supporter, raised a paltry $23,116. That's not good for Republicans, who are trying to bloody up Democrats by intervening in their primaries and have actually bought ads on Graham's behalf. (They portray her as “too liberal for Iowa,” a common tactic to raise the name recognition of a weak candidate.)

Republicans are trailing in some key Senate races, with three exceptions. The Republican path to holding or expanding their Senate majority is simple: hold every seat and try to flip Alabama, Michigan and Minnesota. Just one of those states yielded good news, as Michigan's John James, who raised $12.4 million for his 2018 Senate run, raised $3.1 million for the quarter to $2.5 million for Sen. Gary Peters. In 2018, James remained outspent by Sen. Debbie Stabenow; at the moment, Peters has $6.3 million on hand to $3.9 million for the Republican.

But in Alabama and Minnesota, Sen. Doug Jones and Sen. Tina Smith continued to outpace Republican challengers. In Arizona, Kentucky, Iowa and Maine, Democrats bested Republican incumbents in fundraising. The president's party isn't dominating the Senate dollar chase like Democrats did two years ago, when no incumbent Democrat — not even the four who lost — trailed in off-year fundraising.

The better news for Republicans came in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina (three states the party expects to be competitive and one it doesn't), where incumbents kept their advantages. But in Colorado, the combined Democratic field outpaced Sen. Cory Gardner (he raised more than Hickenlooper, but less than all Democrats) and in North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis faces a conservative primary challenge, he only narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham.

Republicans remain well positioned to hold the Senate. Several seats that they picked up in 2014 have yet to attract strong Democratic challengers. No Democrats running in Alaska, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota raised more than six figures. But so far, between House and Senate races, Democrats are showing more desire to spread their money around, and Republicans are focused more on the race for president. That could change as impeachment heats up, but it's not what might have been expected when the crowded Democratic primary began.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Since Tuesday night's debate, when Pete Buttigieg made his most forceful case yet against Medicare-for-all, the mayor's many left-wing critics have been asking what happened. Not onstage — before that.

Buttigieg, who has been rising in national Democratic politics since 2017, had repeatedly suggested that he supported “Medicare-for-all,” in some form or another. In February 2018, he responded to the left-wing People's Summit's Twitter account with a “pledge” of sorts: “I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forth with declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare-for-all, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered.”

This February , shortly after he announced an exploratory committee, Buttigieg tweeted a photo of a restaurant bill that someone had scrawled “Medicare-for-all” onto, with another message of his own: “On it.” And not long after, during the battery of TV interviews that helped turn him into a top-tier candidate, Buttigieg told a skeptical “Morning Joe” panel that one single government insurance plan was really the midpoint between “government-run health care” and the laissez-faire conservative plan.

“The compromise position is a single-payer system, where you have private doctors, but a public payer,” Buttigieg said. “We've got to stop allowing the right to move the goal posts and characterize the center of the debate.”

Buttigieg is now one of the primary opponents of the House and Senate's Medicare-for-all legislation, which would replace all private health insurance with a tax-financed, expanded Medicare system. But Buttigieg has also been consistent: He has called single-payer the eventual goal of “Medicare-for-all who want it,” which would create a “glide path” to the system that advocates simply call “Medicare-for-all.”

How can both positions be true? Because “Medicare-for-all” is both a specific piece of legislation and a slogan. Because Medicare is popular, everyone in politics — from democratic socialists to Republicans trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — have built their arguments around it. And because several different ideas would actually bring more people into the Medicare system, voters — even attentive voters — have been liberal in what they consider “Medicare-for-all.”

Advocates for the legislation have been stricter. Michael Lighty, who spent two decades advocating for Medicare-for-all with National Nurses United, said Buttigieg’s initial statements were encouraging. (National Nurses United runs the People’s Summit, which had that dialogue with Buttigieg.) They came at a time when all sorts of Democrats — even some who had never supported single-payer health care — were holding up the banner.

“We thought at the time that Mayor Pete was part of the effort, or at least the broad movement,” Lighty said. “We did take him as a supporter of Medicare-for-all.”

At that time, it seemed like nearly every top-tier Democrat was a supporter. The first Democrats to announce their candidacies for 2020 — Elizabeth Warren, Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders and Buttigieg — had either co-sponsored the Sanders legislation or vocally endorsed the policy. And that was just a few months after Barack Obama lumped Medicare-for-all into the “good new ideas” coming from his party.

But over the course of the primary, the sheen fell off. One reason was a multimillion-dollar campaign by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a coalition of insurance groups that ran its first ads against Medicare-for-all in January. Days later, Harris appeared in a CNN town hall where host Jake Tapper pressed her on the text of Medicare-for-all legislation, which would make private insurance illegal if it competed with (as opposed to supplemented) Medicare.

“Listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care,” Harris said. “Who among us has not had that situation, where you got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, wait, I don’t know if your insurance company is going to cover this? Let’s eliminate that. Let’s move on.”

Harris was caught flat-footed; Republicans quickly noted she had, indeed, called for eliminating private insurance, leading to a next-day cleanup where her campaign said she was open to “multiple paths” to universal coverage. That was the first in a string of Democratic clarifications, which by the summer meant that most of Medicare-for-all’s co-sponsors in the presidential race did not actually support the full text of the bill.

Buttigieg’s statements came during that period of confusion. Neither he nor the others abandoned the term “Medicare-for-all,” but he began to redefine it, as a goal. In the future, Americans might enjoy universal Medicare. If they did, it would be because Democrats let everyone buy into the system, and Americans “voted with their feet” to drop their private plans and adopt Medicare.

“When it comes to Medicare-for-all, I believe in universal coverage,” he said in an April interview with New England’s WBUR. “I believe in getting to a Medicare-for-all destination, which is where I want us to go. I think whenever a politician says those words, we also have a responsibility to explain how we get there. I don't think it's as simple as just declaring that it will be so.”

By June, that meant that just three 2020 Democrats supported Sanders’s proposal as written: Sanders himself, Elizabeth Warren and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. And that disturbed Medicare-for-all advocates, who don’t see a “glide path” as the same thing as their plan.

“It’s a false choice, because it preserves the multi-payer system that’s responsible for administrative waste,” said Lighty, who supports Sanders. “The bottom line is that the insurance companies don’t want to pay claims. If you do a ‘glide path’ you’ve still got that problem and you’ve got premiums people may or may not be able to afford.”

In the last few weeks, the private insurance debate has actually given way to a more confusing one: whether Medicare-for-all would raise “middle-class taxes.” The program’s advocates, like Sanders, point out that even conservative cost estimates find that a single-payer system costs less than a mixed private-public system. But in the new system, premiums and co-pays would be replaced by taxes. And since even the Medicare-for-all legislation does not specify how high taxes would go — there’s a separate “white paper” of possible payment methods — opponents have focused on the risk of higher tax bills.

Medicare-for-all advocates are baffled by the debate, which often ignores what patients would not be paying and emphasizes what they would. In every Democrat's health-care plan, insurance costs money. On one hand are Democrats who want, someday, to achieve universal health insurance that people would pay premiums for — partially subsidized by taxpayers, depending on need. On the other are Democrats who want, someday sooner, to achieve universal health insurance for which people would pay taxes.

Buttigieg’s case against Medicare-for-all was aimed at Warren, who, unlike Sanders, won’t answer the question about whether taxes will go up. She pivots, talking about the total cost for middle-class Americans every time, and pledging that she'll drive it down, even as more than 100 million health insurance plans would be replaced. The argument is less about the future of health insurance than about which candidate can explain this stuff in a way that doesn't hurt them — something the term “Medicare-for-all” was supposed to be doing.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

The latest on the impeachment inquiry:

AD WATCH

Eddie Rispone, “Pro.” The wealthy business executive who made it to next month’s runoff against Gov. John Bel Edwards pitched himself as Louisiana’s own President Trump: a successful guy who was tired of politicians. His first post-primary ads consist entirely of Trump delivering the message, “You’ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out.” Every race for governor this year is taking place in a deep red state where Hillary Clinton won less than 40 percent of the vote; the Louisiana race, in particular, has seen Republicans try to force a referendum on Trump.

John Bel Edwards, “This Election.” The Democrat is trying to do something no incumbent from his party has done: win a second term despite being forced into a runoff. His message is the same party-blurring one that he used all year, rephrased to target his GOP opponent. “We have a choice to make,” he says. “Let Eddie Rispone drag us back to the deficits and cuts to health care and education of Bobby Jindal, or continue moving forward and investing in our future?” Jindal, a once-rising star and former governor who left office with a shattered reputation and busted state budget, remains the focus of the Democrats' campaign; Republicans point out that he hasn't been on a ballot since 2011.

Tate Reeves, “Teachers.” Like Kentucky’s Matt Bevin, Mississippi’s lieutenant governor has struggled to win some independent voters because of a conservative policy priority: facing down teachers in a series of budget negotiations. Earlier this year, Reeves signed off on a smaller pay raise than teachers wanted. But it was a raise nonetheless, and Reeves promises here to keep rising wages “to the southern average,” with no tax hikes. “Most teachers don’t do it for the money, but we’ve got to pay them more,” Reeves says.

Jim Hood, “Can't Trust.” The new Reeves ad has been remixed by his Democratic opponent, who draws attention to the details of that pay raise deal. “Last-minute promises on education from a politician we can't trust,” a female narrator warns. ""Tate Reeves has repeatedly killed teacher pay raises.”

No — 47% ( 2)

Do you support a national health plan, a public option, to compete with private insurance?

As Democrats continue to wrestle over Medicare-for-all, the policy’s opponents point to public polling to warn that, whatever the issue’s merits, it’s a political loser. Two years ago, in the aftermath of the GOP’s botched efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Medicare-for-all enjoyed a 12-point advantage in public support. After months of friendly fire from moderate Democrats, it remains popular, but less so, something opponents are taking as a cue for the die-hards to move on.

The wrinkle: Medicare-for-all is still popular, just less popular than the “public option.” Fully 71 percent of Democrats, and 51 percent of independents, support Medicare-for-all. The numbers on the public option are 85 percent and 74 percent, respectively. Democratic jitters about single-payer health care are still about the politics, and about alienating potential voters who disagree with them, more than the policy or the costs.

Joe Biden. He held a post-debate media gaggle in Ohio, as he has done around previous debates, and attacked Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in starker terms that he'd used onstage. ""Bernie doesn’t pay for half his plan,"" he said of Medicare-for-all. ""Look, the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy.""

Bernie Sanders. He quickly fired back at Biden in a statement, calling it “sad” that he was “using the talking points of the insurance industry” to attack him. “Joe must know that we currently spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of almost any other major country and that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.”

Kamala Harris. She introduced a new “justice for rural America” plan while in Iowa, with the centerpiece of new business tax credits; $10,000 for businesses “that hire in rural zones for each full time job they create, with a maximum tax credit of $250,000 per year.”

Elizabeth Warren. It went with just one mention at the debate, but Warren had joined Sanders in proposing big new restrictions on corporate donations to the Democratic National Convention.

Steve Bullock. He tweeted that an Emerson poll showing him at 4 percent in Iowa was big news for his campaign. Unfortunately for him, Emerson is not among the polls that meets the DNC's standards for inclusion in debates.

Michael Bennet. At an appearance in Iowa, he called the president a “treasonous MF,” by way of arguing that he could handle him in a general election.

Tulsi Gabbard. In a Fox News appearance, she continued her criticism of CNN and the New York Times.

Beto O'Rourke. He's holding a counter to the president's Dallas rally, his second “alternative programming” event of the kind.

At least one National Security Council official alerted the White House’s national security lawyers about the concerns, three sources familiar with the matter said, a detail that had not been previously disclosed.

On Saturday, Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, was fatally shot in her Fort Worth home by a white police officer through a closed window. The officer resigned Monday and was later charged with murder.

“Police violence is also gun violence,” Castro said at Tuesday night’s debate, bringing up police shootings in response to a question about gun policy.

“In the places that I grew up in, we weren’t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth,” he said, discussing the idea of police gun-buyback efforts. “And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.”

Castro served in the Obama administration and was once viewed as having potential to shake up the 2020 race, given his relative youth and potential appeal to Hispanic voters. But he has struggled to gain traction. My colleague Aaron Blake noted Castro’s poor fundraising haul and the likelihood that he won’t qualify for the next Democratic debate.

But his drawing attention to the issue at Tuesday’s debate was well received by many black viewers and activists — some of the people who feel most affected by police violence.

Castro keeps being the guy who brings up the thing people aren't talking about. Today, police violence. He's a great national leader and whatever happens, needs to be heard. #DemDebates — David M. Perry (@Lollardfish) October 16, 2019

Activist April Reign, who counts Castro among the three candidates she supports most, praised the former San Antonio mayor for consistently addressing an issue that she says media has ignored.

AD

“I expected Secretary Castro to address the issue of police violence, because he has consistently said the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of state-sanctioned violence, both tonight and during previous debates,” Reign told The Fix. “Secretary Castro also has a comprehensive new policing reform plan; not all of the candidates do. I hope all candidates do a better job of affirmatively discussing issues of importance to black women, the most consistent voting bloc that Democrats have. One of those issues is police violence, as we are constantly in fear for our partners, our children, our family members and ourselves.”

During the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) highlighted the issue in their quest to win younger black voters. This year, however, it appears that the candidates drawing the most attention to the issue are not gaining significant traction with black voters — or any voters. Former vice president Joe Biden holds the lead with black voters, according to polling, suggesting they are not penalizing him for not leading the conversation on this issue.

But that does not mean black voters won’t continue to pressure candidates to discuss what very much remains a real issue despite a decrease in shooting deaths by police. The Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery wrote last year:

AD

While police shootings have continued, the number of unarmed people being killed has dipped and therefore so has the number of videos of such shootings that galvanize the public, In 2015, 36 unarmed black men were fatally shot by police; footage of the armed yet compliant Castile, 12-year-old Tamir Rice and Walter Scott dying from their wounds prompted massive protests. In 2017, the figure was 19. Of the 33 black people fatally shot by police so far in 2018, only two incidents are known to have been caught on a body camera. Some policing experts say officers have become more cautious.

For real change to happen, an action plan must be articulated, especially to win black voters, said Ibram Kendi, director of the American University Antiracist and Policy Center, a research center focused on developing public policies that fight racism.

AD

“It is not enough to condemn police violence,” he told The Fix. “I want to hear a substantial policy debate about how to curb police violence. I would like the candidates to put forth sweeping policy plans to address this crisis of police violence.”

Kendi said the lack of attention given to this issue at debates may have to do with who is overseeing the debates and their target audience.

“It seems as if the networks and moderators are focused on framing questions that speak to three things: profound policy disagreements between the candidates, topics grabbing persisting national headlines and matters that speak to white moderates,” he said. “Police violence doesn’t fit the mold. White moderates are making up the ‘all lives matter’ crowd. Police violence doesn’t snatch national headlines for more than a day. And all the front-running candidates have spoken out against police violence and racism.”

Dante Barry, co-founder of the Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, a human rights organization focused on eradicating gun violence, said he expects Castro and Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) to aggressively speak out about gun violence, “given their backgrounds and where they come from.” But discussions about gun violence’s impact on people of color appear to be missing from the national conversation, Barry said.

“The conversations around gun violence that get the most amount of attention are mass shootings and school shootings, particularly when the incidents are impacting predominantly white communities, even though mass shootings represent a fraction of the hundreds of lives taken every day by gun violence,” he told The Fix.

For many black voters, police violence should be part of the conversation about gun policy as long as perceptions about systemic discrimination among law enforcement stay prevalent. According to a Pew Research Center survey, the overwhelming majority of black adults, 84 percent, say black people are generally treated less fairly than whites by police.

Tuesday’s debate was an echo of the previous three. In past debates, Biden, the perceived front-runner, was the target of attacks. On Tuesday, Warren, the rising candidate, came under sharp criticism from several rivals over the specifics of some of her many plans, the tone of her rhetoric and her repeated unwillingness to answer a direct question about health care and taxes.

There was another disagreement over whether Medicare-for-all is the best policy to ensure affordable health care or an expensive and disruptive pipe dream. The health-care issue has figured in every debate, an ideological divide that continues to separate those in the progressive wing from those on the center-left.

Biden began the campaign as the clear leader in the polls but with questions about his candidacy. He has had opportunities to put those to rest, though a series of shaky debate performances has put him in a more challenging position. Although he still is the co-leader in the polls, he is no longer seen as the dominant candidate. Some Democrats believe that his debate performances have contributed to his inability to consolidate his position at the start of the campaign.

AD

AD

Warren has benefited from a succession of steady and effective debate performances, reflecting the discipline she has brought to other aspects of her campaign. From the start, she has run her campaign on her own terms, an operation long on policy initiatives and energetic grass-roots organizing.

Her discipline and consistency have paid dividends politically, but as Tuesday’s debate showed, she will become as much a focus of attacks from the other candidates as Biden. Her rise heightens the importance of the ideological divide that has been part of the backdrop of the Democratic nomination contest from the start, as well as questions about who is the most electable candidate.

Sanders has been steady in the debates but rarely the standout, and he continues to be a powerhouse grass-roots fundraiser. But he has lost support over several months, and now there is a new challenge to overcome.

The Ohio debate was Sanders’s first major event since he suffered a heart attack, prompting questions about his health and age, though Tuesday night, he was robust and vigorous on the stage. Busting in at one point, Sanders said, “I’m healthy, I’m feeling great.”

The first votes are still months away, but already the campaign has run through several cycles of conventional wisdom. Earlier, Biden was seen as the person to beat, with all the others chasing him. Later, the race was considered a contest among four or five candidates: the top three plus South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.). Then it became a three-person race, and today some commentators wonder whether it is a two-person campaign pitting Biden against Warren.

The shifting assessments are a reminder that more changes could come in the months ahead. Past campaigns have seen dramatic shifts between Labor Day and the results in Iowa and New Hampshire. Whether it is the surprise emergence of a dark horse or the unexpected collapse of a serious contender, fortunes change as more voters begin to check in and pay attention.

But getting attention is a constant challenge for all the Democrats. President Trump is a master at setting and commanding the conversation, for good or ill. His dominance of the media’s focus is unlike anything seen before. Democrats have had few moments this year when they weren’t sharing the spotlight with the president.

On Tuesday, the debate was competing for attention with House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry as well as the controversy over the president’s decision to pull back U.S. forces in northern Syria, opening the way for Turkey to invade and take out Kurdish fighters who were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State.

Trump isn’t the only problem the Democrats face in gaining a hearing from voters. The sheer size of the field inevitably has drawn more attention to the best-known candidates. “The number of candidates makes it difficult for anyone to really break through except the front-runners,” said Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter. “When lower-tier candidates do break through, it’s usually because of an attack, which doesn’t necessarily gain them more support.”

There are plenty of examples of that — of candidates scrambling to produce a viral moment, only to see it disappear quickly. Harris went after Biden in the first debate and saw her poll numbers spike. Ahead of the second debate, those numbers began to slide, and in that debate, she was attacked and faltered. Her poll numbers fell further, and she has yet to recover.

In the first debate, former housing secretary Julián Castro attacked Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, on the issue of immigration. He was able to raise some money off the exchange but saw no significant rise in his support.

In a later debate, he hectored Biden, accusing him of not being able to remember something Biden had said minutes earlier, in what was widely seen as a veiled attack on the former vice president’s age and mental fitness. The gambit rebounded against Castro.

“It’s clear in this cycle that one good moment, one good jab, is not sufficient to move the polls,” an O’Rourke adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment freely, said in an email. “We had a great moment last debate, and it didn’t do much for us in terms of poll movement.”

On Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) trained her sights on Warren, attacking her fellow senator on health care, in particular why Warren would not say whether her plan for Medicare-for-all would require raising taxes on middle-class Americans. Klobuchar has tried in previous debates to make her mark as a results-oriented moderate, without success. Whether Tuesday night will change that is debatable.

An adviser to one of the candidates looking for a breakthrough emailed this assessment: “The questions in the debate are disproportionately directed towards those who are already ahead in polls. Then the post-debate coverage is framed about what happened to and between those candidates. So it’s largely a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

For many of the candidates, the route to success is now more likely to come from developing support on the ground, starting in the early states, rather than assuming that a debate will provide the springboard.

“Anyone who thinks they’re going to walk away with this nomination purely on the debate stage” is wrong, said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’s campaign manager. “You’re going to have to win all other facets of this campaign.”

Tuesday’s debate generated sharpness at all levels. It wasn’t just lower-tier candidates attacking those at the top. In the final hour, Biden squared off against Sanders and Warren. His exchange with Warren was about who had gotten big changes enacted into law, and a brief moment of testiness was palpable, foreshadowing the campaign to come.

House investigators are hearing from Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, behind closed doors. McKinley resigned last week amid worsening morale at the State Department and widespread concern that Pompeo has done little to defend diplomats who became ensnared in efforts by Trump to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

8:15 p.m.: Trump tweets derisive remarks about Pelosi, calls her ‘a very sick person’

Hours after their contentious White House meeting, Trump suggested Pelosi was mentally ill and told people to “pray for her.”

“Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her ‘upstairs,’ or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!” Trump tweeted.

AD

Earlier he tweeted a photo of the meeting where Pelosi is standing while speaking and everyone else is seated. The White House said it was evidence of her “meltdown,” but Pelosi supporters said it showed she was standing up to the president, literally. Pelosi made the photo the main image for her Twitter account.

AD

Trump’s attack on the speaker of the House are in contrast to the many kind things he’s said about her in the past. He seemed to stick up for her when she was vying for votes to become speaker earlier this year, and after she secured the gavel he said she deserved a “great deal of credit for what she’s done and what she’s accomplished.”

6:45 p.m.: Schiff sends House members update on impeachment, says he intends to make transcripts public

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, who is overseeing the impeachment inquiry, said in a letter sent to House colleagues that he intends to make the interview transcripts public, but was vague on when.

AD

“As the investigation proceeds, and at a time that it will not jeopardize investigative equities, we will make the interview transcripts public, subject to any necessary redactions for classified or sensitive information,” Schiff wrote. “We also anticipate that at an appropriate point in the investigation, we will be taking witness testimony in public, so that the full Congress and the American people can hear their testimony firsthand.”

Schiff also pushed back at the claim by Republicans and the White House that the Democrats have blocked GOP members from participating in the interviews with key witnesses, saying both “the majority and minority have been provided equal staff representation and time to question witnesses.”

He also said the decisions by Trump administration agencies and officials, including Vice President Pence, to defy congressional subpoenas would be viewed “as evidence of the President’s effort to obstruct the impeachment inquiry, and we may also use that obstruction as additional evidence of the wrongfulness of the President’s underlying conduct.”

5:15 p.m.: McCarthy says Pelosi’s ‘whole focus has to be on impeachment,’ even though it didn’t come up in meeting

After exiting the White House, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) took aim at Pelosi, calling her behavior “unbecoming” and accusing her of storming out of what had later turned out to be “a very productive” meeting.

“Unfortunately, the speaker tries to make everything political,” McCarthy said, adding: “Her whole focus has to be on impeachment.”

Asked whether the impeachment inquiry came up during the meeting, however, McCarthy said that it did not.

5 p.m.: Democrats walk out of Syria meeting with Trump, saying he was insulting and went on a ‘nasty diatribe’

AD

At their first meeting since the impeachment inquiry began, Trump disparaged Pelosi, prompting the speaker, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) to make an abrupt exit.

AD

“He couldn’t handle it,” Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol, referring to a House vote earlier Wednesday condemning Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. “He just couldn’t handle it. . . . So, he just kind of engaged in a meltdown.”

Pelosi added that she is praying for Trump’s health. Pressed for more, she responded: “I’m not talking about mentally. I’m talking about handling the truth.”

AD

In remarks outside the White House, Schumer had told reporters that Trump had called Pelosi a “third-rate politician.” Pelosi later clarified at the Capitol that Trump had called her a “third-grade politician.”

Schumer said that during the meeting, Trump “was insulting, particularly to the speaker.”

“She kept her cool completely. But he called her a third-rate politician. . . . It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts,” Schumer told reporters after the meeting, which focused on Syria and during which impeachment was not discussed.

AD

Hoyer said after the meeting that Trump had made disparaging remarks about a number of Democrats, including former president Barack Obama.

“It became a derogatory meeting from the president’s side and very quickly went downhill,” he said.

4:05 p.m.: Conservative group to air TV ads against Romney

The Club for Growth, a free-market advocacy group historically focused on fiscal conservatism, has a new TV ad going after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).

The ad calls Romney “slick, slippery, stealthy” and a “Democrat secret asset” who is “plotting to take down President Trump with impeachment.”

Romney has been more critical of the president over the Ukraine issue than any other congressional Republican, and Trump has fired back angrily.

Notably, the group targeted Trump with attack ads in 2015, warning conservatives that “he’s really playing us for chumps.”

At the time, Trump called the Club for Growth “little respected.”

3:30 p.m.: McConnell says he expects Senate to meet six days a week during impeachment trial, beginning around Thanksgiving

McConnell told Senate Republicans he expects that the House will vote to impeach Trump and that the Senate trial will probably begin around Thanksgiving, according to a senator who attended.

At the weekly Senate GOP luncheon, McConnell also fielded questions about the details of the process and told lawmakers that the Senate would probably meet six days a week during the trial, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.

“There’s sort of a planned expectation that it would be sometime around Thanksgiving, so you’d have basically Thanksgiving to Christmas — which would be wonderful, because there’s no deadline in the world like the next break to motivate senators,” Cramer said.

AD

He added that McConnell, his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) fielded “every question you could imagine” during the luncheon.

“I have to admit I was grateful for the civics lesson, because it’s not something we deal with very often, thank God,” he said.

One issue that came up, Cramer noted, was the fine line Republican senators walk between criticizing the House-led impeachment inquiry and maintaining neutrality ahead of the likely Senate trial.

“The question becomes, how do we as a conference remain strongly united and open-minded should it come to trial, while at the same time, in the meantime, standing up for obvious injustices between now and then?” Cramer said.

2 p.m.: Trump claims, without evidence, that Obama was behind 2016 election ‘corruption’

At a joint news conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday, Trump was asked by an Italian reporter about Attorney General William P. Barr’s meetings with Italian officials.

Trump dodged the question, saying he didn’t know the details. He then pivoted, declaring that there was “a lot of corruption” in the 2016 campaign and accusing former president Barack Obama of being behind it.

No evidence has emerged to back up Trump’s assertion.

“There was a lot of corruption; maybe it goes right up to President Obama,” Trump said. “I happen to think that it does.”

1:50 p.m.: One Giuliani associate released on bond

One of two associates of Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani arrested at Dulles International Airport last week has been released on bond, a day before they are both set to appear in federal court in New York on campaign finance charges .

Igor Fruman left the Alexandria federal courthouse with his attorney just before 2 p.m. Wednesday and declined to answer questions about his case.

Fruman put up property in Florida worth $1 million to secure his release, according to court records. Lev Parnas, his business partner, remains behind bars. A federal judge in Alexandria agreed to release Parnas if he could offer as collateral a $1 million business. He has not yet done so.

Where Parnas and Fruman got the money they are accused of illegally pouring into American politics remains a mystery. Parnas paid Giuliani $500,000 as a consultant while helping him drum up support for an investigation into Hunter Biden in Ukraine. But he also owes more than that in a civil suit involving a failed movie project.

1 p.m.: ‘Mr. President, release your tax returns, or shut up,’ Biden says

In an exchange with reporters in Ohio, Biden faced repeated questions about the actions of his son in Ukraine.

He said his son’s comments speak for themselves, then turned the question back to Trump: “Mr. President, release your tax returns, or shut up.”

12:45 p.m.: Schumer says Senate Republicans should withhold judgment on Trump

In remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer called on Republicans in the chamber to withhold judgment on Trump, given that the Senate may be called upon to act as jurors in a potential impeachment trial.

“We are several steps away from a potential trial in the Senate,” Schumer said. “The House continues to do its work diligently, even-handedly, with only the facts in mind. So I’d remind my Republican colleagues in this chamber that committing, today, to vote ‘not guilty’ is contrary to their oath to ‘do impartial justice.’ That’s their oath.”

He took particular aim at McConnell and Graham, arguing that they “seem determined to turn this serious inquiry into another partisan exercise.”

12:40: Democrats plan to derail resolution calling for censure of Schiff

Democrats are expected to vote Thursday to derail a Republican-sponsored resolution to censure Schiff for his handling of the impeachment inquiry, according to a House Democratic aide.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) is the lead sponsor of the resolution.

Republicans have taken issue with several aspects of Schiff’s handling of the inquiry, including a statement in a recent hearing in which Schiff included an embellished version of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Schiff later said his remarks were intended as a parody and that should have been apparent to Trump and other critics.

Pelosi has stood by Schiff, and Democrats are expected to have the votes to “table” the resolution, which will prevent a vote on the measure itself.

12:15 p.m.: Perry declines to say whether he will comply with subpoena

In an appearance on Fox Business Network on Wednesday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry declined to commit about complying with a congressional subpoena.

“Hey, listen,” Perry said. “The House has sent a subpoena over for the records that we have. And our general counsel and the White House counsel are going through the process right now. And I’m going to follow the lead of the, of my counsel on that.”

Friday is the deadline for documents to be released from the White House and Perry. Trump has said Perry asked him to make the July call to Zelensky, but Perry told reporters last week he did it so that the two could talk about energy issues.

11:45 a.m.: Trump says Pelosi has ‘done this country a tremendous disservice’

Hours before they were set to meet face-to-face for the first time since the launch of the impeachment inquiry, Trump told reporters that Pelosi has “done this country a tremendous disservice.”

“She’s created a phony witch hunt, another one,” Trump said of the impeachment inquiry focused on his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. “This one is just absolutely crazy. . . . This is an open-and-shut simple case.”

Trump’s comments came during an Oval Office meeting with Mattarella. Later Wednesday, Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders, including Pelosi, about the Turkish incursion in Syria.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump contended Democrats are “desperate because they know they’re going to lose the election.”

“They’re playing games,” he said. “They figure they can’t win the election, so maybe we can find some ground, somebody that Trump never met, and maybe they’ll say something bad about Trump, and if they do, really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit. I don’t think it’s going to work.”

11:30 a.m.: ‘I don’t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani,’ Trump says of Bolton

In an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office after meeting with Mattarella, Trump claimed he personally got along “pretty well” with his former national security adviser, John Bolton, but suggested that there was friction between Bolton and Giuliani.

“Look, John Bolton, I get along well with him,” Trump said when asked whether he was concerned that Democrats may call Bolton to testify in their impeachment inquiry. “I actually got along with him pretty well. It just didn’t work out. . . . I don’t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani.”

Trump defended Giuliani, arguing that he “was seeking out corruption, and I think there’s nothing wrong with seeking out corruption.”

According to two people familiar with the matter, Fiona Hill, the National Security Council’s former top adviser on Russia and Europe, told lawmakers earlier this week that Bolton was infuriated by a shadow operation being conducted by Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the president’s political rival.

Bolton had likened Giuliani to a “hand grenade” and had instructed Hill to raise the matter with White House lawyers, the people said.

Pressed Wednesday about a Washington Post report that Giuliani had urged Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric living in exile in the United States, the president dismissed the fact that Giuliani had not registered as a foreign lobbyist.

“You have to ask Rudy those questions,” Trump said. “Don’t ask me.”

11:15 a.m.: Fourth defendant in Giuliani associates’ case arrested at New York airport

David Correia, the fourth defendant in a campaign finance case involving business associates of Giuliani, was arrested Wednesday morning at a New York City airport, officials said.

Correia has been charged with participating in a scheme to use foreign money to build political support for a fledgling recreational marijuana business in Nevada and other states, according to an indictment unsealed last week. The indictment also charged Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman with conspiracy and making false statements to election regulators.

The other three defendants were quickly arrested by the FBI, including Andrey Kukushkin, who is also accused in the alleged scheme. But Correia’s whereabouts have been unclear until Wednesday morning. All four defendants are due to appear in federal court Thursday morning.

“The defendant was taken into custody by the FBI at JFK earlier this morning,” said Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan.

10:45 a.m.: House Republicans accuse Democrats of ‘Soviet-style tactics’

At their weekly news conference, House Republican leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against Democrats, accusing them of “Soviet-style tactics” for holding closed-door depositions — even though Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in those depositions.

“What is Chairman Schiff trying to hide from the American people?” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said, referring to the House Intelligence Committee chairman.

Biggs struck a similar note, saying of Schiff: “He’s taken this to a Soviet-style inquiry.”

McCarthy argued that Democrats’ handling of the impeachment inquiry suggests they “believe you’re guilty until you prove your innocence.”

But McCarthy also denied that Trump had asked foreign countries to investigate Biden — even though the president has done so publicly in remarks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.

“Every single day in America, we work with other countries to solve open cases,” McCarthy said, adding that the president “did nothing wrong.”

10:40 a.m. Jeffries says Republicans are ‘unable to defend the indefensible’

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a Pelosi ally in House leadership, on Wednesday defended her resistance to Republican demands to hold a full House vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry.

Speaking at a news conference, Jeffries said it was a “textbook abuse of power” for Trump to have pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid was being withheld.

Jeffries said there is nothing in the Constitution, Supreme Court precedent or House rules that requires a vote to launch an impeachment inquiry.

“They are unable to defend the indefensible, so the Republicans are arguing about cosmetic procedural matters,” he said, characterizing Trump’s actions as “abhorrent behavior.”

10 a.m.: Pompeo adviser to decry politicization of State Department in impeachment probe testimony

McKinley, the former senior adviser to Pompeo until his sudden resignation last week, will tell House impeachment investigators Wednesday that career diplomats were mistreated during his tenure and that some had their careers derailed for political reasons, according to a person familiar with his testimony.

McKinley will outline how his concerns culminated with the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a punitive action he and many other rank-and-file diplomats viewed as wholly unjustified.

“The unwillingness of State Department leadership to defend Yovanovitch or interfere with an obviously partisan effort to intervene in our relationship with Ukraine for the political benefit of the president was too much for him,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.

Kurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, has arrived at the Capitol. He is reviewing transcripts of his Oct. 3 testimony, according to a committee aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details that are not public.

Volker previously gave House committees text messages depicting State Department officials apparently coordinating with Giuliani to leverage a public promise of an investigation into the Bidens for a meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s new president.

8:30 a.m.: Trump, Pelosi to see one another for first time since inquiry began

Trump and Pelosi are scheduled to come face-to-face for the first time since the launch of the impeachment inquiry during a meeting at the White House scheduled for 3 p.m. Wednesday about Turkish military aggression in Syria. Trump has invited congressional leaders from both parties.

Trump might get questions earlier in the day about the impeachment inquiry. He is scheduled to hold a joint news conference at noon with visiting Italian President Sergio Mattarella.

7:45 a.m.: Trump suggests he’s facing possible impeachment because the Democratic presidential field is weak

In morning tweets, Trump panned the performances of the Democratic presidential candidates in Tuesday night’s debate — and suggested he is facing an impeachment inquiry because the field is weak.

“You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States,” Trump wrote. “Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!”

He later predicted dire consequences if any of the Democrats prevail.

“Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!” he wrote.

In another tweet, Trump quoted conservative cable host Graham Ledger calling the impeachment inquiry a “Constitutional Travesty” and said he is the wrong politician to target.

“It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!” Trump tweeted, referring to the House Intelligence Committee chairman and the House speaker, both California Democrats. Members of Congress cannot be impeached.

Trump also echoed the arguments of his Republican allies who have spent more time attacking the impeachment process than defending Trump’s actions.

“Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted.

7:30 a.m.: McCarthy ramps up attacks on Pelosi over process

McCarthy ramped up his attacks Wednesday on Pelosi, arguing that Democrats were treating Trump unfairly during the impeachment inquiry.

“You’ve got a better chance of having a fair judicial system in China than in Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives,” McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends.”

McCarthy complained that House investigators are taking depositions behind closed doors, that only Democrats can call witnesses and that Trump does not have a lawyer present to cross-examine witnesses.

During the depositions, Republican lawmakers and staff are allowed to question witnesses. Democrats have said that they are conducting depositions behind closed doors so that witnesses cannot tailor their accounts to previous testimony.

Earlier this week, Schiff said he expects some witnesses to testify again in open sessions and said transcripts will be released later.

The process is consistent with House rules but has differed in some respects from previous impeachment inquiries.

“You know in America you’re innocent until proven guilty until you let the Democrats become in charge,” McCarthy said during his Fox News interview.

7 a.m.: Former Pompeo adviser to testify about State Department

McKinley is expected to testify before House investigators leading the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday morning.

He will come to the Hill with an intimate understanding of how Pompeo wielded power in the highest echelons of the State Department, given his proximity to the top diplomat on his many trips abroad.

The format for the testimony is a “transcribed interview,” said a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet made public, which places fewer restrictions on the interview process than in a formal deposition.

6:40 a.m.: Trump campaign calls inquiry a ‘sham’ because of no formal vote

The Trump campaign seized Wednesday morning on the announcement by Democratic leaders that they still have no plans for a full House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry.

In morning tweets, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Democrats were “trampling all over due process” and called the ongoing inquiry an “illegitimate, unprecedented sham” and an “illegitimate plot to overthrow a duly elected President.”

In a news conference Tuesday, Pelosi noted that there is no constitutional requirement for a full House vote to open an impeachment inquiry.

“There is no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,” Pelosi said.

Schiff told reporters that Republicans are calling for a vote because “they don’t want to discuss the president’s conduct; they would much rather discuss process.”

6 a.m.: Impeachment first topic in Democratic presidential debate

The impeachment inquiry was the first topic tackled at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump’s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.

Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt U.S. president in history. He highlighted the White House’s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. “They have no choice but to move,” he said of House Democrats.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn’t think the impeachment process would take very long."

Candidates line up onstage at the fourth debate, at Otterbein University in Ohio. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

WESTERVILLE, Ohio — The largest presidential debate in history offered at least one surprise: Less time was spent on intra-Democratic swiping than in any of these prime-time forums so far. Before their umpteenth fight about Medicare-for-all, 12 Democrats took turns explaining why the president deserved impeachment. At the one-hour mark, they got to attack the Trump administration's out-of-nowhere abandonment of Syria's Kurds.

Both exchanges delivered what Democratic voters want out of these debates — a focus on how their party will defeat the president in 2020. And the result was simultaneously the debate with the most pointed exchanges but the least damage to any potential nominee. Here's what mattered, with candidates listed in the very neutral order of who got the most time to who got the least.

Elizabeth Warren. It's one of these debates' great mysteries: Why do Warren's rivals keep telegraphing how they're going to attack her? In campaign stops and interviews over the last week, Pete Buttigieg said he'd hold the senator from Massachusetts accountable on Medicare-for-all, and he did. Amy Klobuchar told Bill Maher last week that “just because people say ideas are bold doesn’t mean they are bold,” a line she reformulated onstage. (“I have bold ideas to get us there. Just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're not bold.”)

Nothing, in other words, came at Warren like a surprise. No one rattled her on health care. She never lost control and frequently spun the debate back to the places she was comfortable. Twice, she was attacked in a way that teed up her absolute favorite topics. That happened when former congressman Beto O'Rourke accused her of “punitive” tax policies, which became a cue for Warren's riff on how billionaires owe the country more: “Pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.” It happened again when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) asked why she would not demand that Twitter deactivate the president's account: Warren simply began talking about campaign finance reform.

A curious mythology has been built around Warren's success so far, crediting that success on opponents' reluctance to attack her. But this was actually the third time, in a row, that Warren was accused of making impossible promises, especially on health care, and she was ready for it, making the memorable promise not to “sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.”

Worst moment: A minor slip in an exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), when Warren said she didn't want “troops in the Middle East,” forcing her campaign to clarify that she meant “combat troops.” But none of her rivals pounced until after the debate, and it's not clear that anti-interventionism is a loser with Democratic voters.

Best moment: “I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

Joe Biden. He entered the debate facing louder and more numerous questions about his sharpness as a candidate. None of that got settled onstage. Biden's response to his son's work for a Ukrainian energy company lacked the lectern-slamming power of the speeches he'd been giving over the last two weeks. “My son's statement speaks for itself,” Biden said, referring to a Hunter Biden interview that not all viewers had seen. “He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself.”

Democratic voters don't think the attacks on Biden, from Trump, have been accurate or fair. Biden's recent stagnation is more about how primary voters view his ability to wage a general election campaign, and in some ways he was less engaged in Ohio than he was during last month's debate in Texas. Biden's habit of packing multiple policies into one answer showed up in a head-scratching response about taxing the very rich.

“No, look, demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done,” he said. “And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax — I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5 percent. I would double it, because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who’s clipping coupons in the stock market make — in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is — like I said — the — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.”

Worst moment: Leaning into Warren's space to tell her that he “went on the floor and got [her] votes” for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, something that Biden seemed to quickly recognize as a mistake; seconds later, he said she did “a hell of a job.”

Best moment: A question about Biden's age let him give the succinct, convincing case for why voters should want a trusted, tested statesman to replace Donald Trump. “Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience,” he said. “With it comes wisdom.”

Amy Klobuchar. Donors with doubts about Biden have been waiting for the senator from Minnesota to come into her own as a centrist alternative; specifically, they were waiting for her to supplement her own pitch with a case against Warren and Sanders. She did so, though there hasn’t been much demand, among Democrats, for the sort of attacks Klobuchar decided on — a line about “the difference between a plan and a pipe dream” fed right into Warren’s argument that other Democrats simply ruled out big ideas.

Klobuchar might have connected more to primary voters in less flashy moments, spelling out her specific plans on topics like small business and drug company abuses. “The people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place,” said of companies that had flooded the opioid market.

Worst moment: Klobuchar began one volley against Warren by saying she was “tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points.” Warren had called attacks on Medicare-for-all “Republican talking points” two debates earlier, but not on Tuesday.

Best moment: A great joke at both Warren's and Tom Steyer's expense: “No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.”

Beto O'Rourke. With every debate, the Texan's rivals have become less subtle about their contempt for him. O’Rourke didn’t get a real “hell yes” moment, something to recapture the excitement of his mandatory gun buyback position. More than ever before, his style of emphasizing where he had been and whom he had talked to got thin. What was effective in his Senate bid against Ted Cruz, whom he could reasonably peg as a distracted senator, was much less effective deployed against fellow Democrats who’ve been campaigning just as much as he has.

Worst moment: The baffling minute when O'Rourke asked Warren if she'd raise taxes on families that make less than $250,000 per year, when Warren was reiterating that her signature policies were paid for by a wealth tax.

Best moment: O’Rourke stood his ground when Pete Buttigieg accused him of being glib about the gun buyback. “That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47,” said O’Rourke, channeling the position of Parkland survivors.

Bernie Sanders. The senator's heart attack was a setback for his campaign, with one upside: It dramatically lowered expectations for the candidate who's got the most experience in presidential primary debates. After a stent and nearly two weeks off the trail, Sanders hadn’t changed at all. He teamed up with Warren to defend Medicare-for-all. Other candidates latched onto Sanders’s comment that “taxes will go up” under his bill to attack Warren; Sanders never did.

“The way you win an election in this time in history is not the same old, same old,” he said. “You have to inspire people. You have to excite people. You've got to bring working people and young people and poor people into the political process.”

Worst moment: There wasn’t really one. He didn’t answer in detail about his heart attack, but moderators asked just one question without a followup.

Best moment: Right near the end, Sanders got to land a Biden critique that, for whatever reason, there hadn't been time or space for previously. “You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.”

Pete Buttigieg. Like Klobuchar, Buttigieg has become increasingly interesting to donors and voters who have worries about Biden. Like her, he adopted a much harsher approach than in any previous debate.

Sometimes it worked, as there’s definitely an audience for attacks on Warren’s Medicare positioning. Sometimes it made much less sense, like when the South Bend, Ind., mayor followed up on Warren’s case for a wealth tax by asking what Democrats would do to win Midwestern voters who picked Trump “because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything.” Warren had actually offered a popular policy — the wealth tax — while Buttigieg hadn’t. The effectiveness of Buttigieg's strategy will take a few days to suss out, as Democrats have not yet rewarded any candidate for going negative. But Buttigieg had framed his attack as straight talk, and his oratorical skills were what attracted so much support in the first place.

Worst moment: The second repetition of his most canned-sounding line: “Let me tell, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live.”

Best moment: There were several; he really was the most effective attacker on the stage. It might be a tie between his teeth-baring response to O'Rourke (“I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal”) and the deft way he tied Gabbard to Trump (“You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policy, as you're doing”).

Kamala Harris. Just as she did in Houston, Harris benefited from a fall to the middle of the pack; she can get twisted up when defending specific polices but is compelling when describing the crises worsened or left unmanaged by the president.

Best moment: She conveyed what many, many Democrats think about these debates: that moderators keep going after the same issues and ignoring liberal priorities. “This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today.”

Worst moment: The decision to go after Warren for not, like Harris, calling on Twitter to remove the president's account. Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, one of Harris's surrogates, argued that the president's abusive tweets were especially threatening to nonwhite voters, and that Warren, revealingly, didn't appreciate that. But Harris didn't make that connection herself.

Cory Booker. Democrats simply don't know what to make of the senator from New Jersey, who keeps delivering solid, occasionally captivating turns at these debates, moving into the top three or four choices of early state voters … and never moving up to number one.

Worst moment: A joke about Donald Trump being the least healthy candidate running for president didn't really land, but it didn't do harm.

Best moment. No one is happier when defending fellow Democrats from attacks, as he did even after a negative question to Biden was long over. “I saw this play in 2016's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies.”

Andrew Yang. He's settled into a unique role in the primary: He talks about universal basic income and worries that other Democrats are too reliant on traditional politics. And that's it.

Worst moment: The strange decision to impugn Warren over her wealth tax while promoting the far less popular Value Added Tax (VAT), a regressive sales tax.

Best moment: The most memorable was his hype man cheering for Beto O'Rourke's call to legalize marijuana.

Julián Castro. He had suffered from attacking Joe Biden last month, a fact that deeply frustrated his supporters — there's a feeling that other candidates can make a debate point and win, but Castro gets singled out as nasty.

Worst moment: Nothing stood out: No harm, no risk, no damage. But not much discussion of his candidacy since the debate, either.

Best moment: Having shown up O'Rourke in their first debate together, Castro did it again by asking why O'Rourke trusted police to go door to door and confiscate guns: “I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.”

Tulsi Gabbard. In June and July, the Hawaii congresswoman earned a reputation as a knife-fighter, embarrassing Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in an exchange about the 9/11 attacks and unloading on Harris over her “deeply concerning” record as a prosecutor. Gabbard's fan base, and sometimes the candidate herself, embraced the idea that she would flatten her opponents. Instead, Gabbard largely fell flat, bungling two attacks on Warren (one of them cut off by a commercial break) and repeatedly taking Republican-friendly stances that have little support among Democrats. Not many primary voters want to be told that their party has been trying to divide the country because Donald Trump won.

Worst moment: Using an unrelated question to make a swipe at, of all people, Hillary Clinton: “When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables, I see fellow Americans.”

Best moment: Laying out her anti-“regime change war” philosophy, when not paired with an attack, was effective: “Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war.”

Tom Steyer. For a first-time candidate, he fit in naturally on a stage with professional politicians. He fit in so well, in fact, that he left without making much of an impression.

Worst moment: Like Buttigieg, he went after Washington in general for having “failed.” That's just not much of an argument for Democratic voters, who do not share Republican aversion to professional politics.

Best moment: Using his very first seconds onstage to praise the field: “Every candidate here is more decent, more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.” Of course, that tempted the question of why Steyer decided to run in the first place.

POLL WATCH

Kentucky governor (Mason-Dixon, 625 registered voters)

Andy Beshear (D) — 46% (-2)

Matt Bevin (R) — 46% ( 6)

Bevin, elected in a 2015 upset, has been one of the country's least popular Republican governors. Democrats have been optimistic all year about Beshear, the state's attorney general (and son of the last Democratic governor), running an education-centric campaign and beating the governor. This is the first in a series of (very intermittent) polls that have found Bevin recovering, and the pollster itself speculates that Republicans could be coming home to Bevin out of anger at the impeachment inquiry. Nearly two-thirds of voters say they oppose that inquiry, more than support the president.

ON THE TRAIL

As first reported by the Post’s Sean Sullivan and some other guy, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will appear at Sen. Bernie Sanders’s Saturday rally in Queens to endorse him for president. Also supporting Sanders: Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. They make up most of the four-member “squad,” the left-wing female Democrats who roared into power in 2018; the fourth member, Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, remains neutral.

Each endorsement was a coup for Sanders; Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib, in particular, had been courted by Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts lunched with Ocasio-Cortez in March, and months later she took time during a Detroit campaign swing to record a video about “environmental racism” with Tlaib.

The Warren campaign had nothing negative to say about their choices. The Sanders campaign, meanwhile, argued that the “squad” endorsements would help their candidate build a “multi-racial coalition” and win the primary and the general election.

“As you've heard Bernie Sanders say a million times, in order for him to win, we have to mobilize young people,” said Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. “If we can have a turnout of young people that doubles, you'd have the revolution that Bernie Sanders has been eager to see come about.”

The endorsements come as Sanders has slipped with that coalition. In its early days, the 2020 Sanders campaign pointed to polls to argue that their candidate had the youngest, most diverse and most working-class support of anyone seeking the Democratic nomination.

That’s changed as Sanders has fallen back — though, to be fair, he runs stronger in some polls than others. In June, according to Quinnipiac’s near-monthly polling, Sanders was winning 25 percent of nonwhite voters and 24 percent of voters making less than $50,000; Warren was at just 11 and 10 percent in those demographics.

By this month, Sanders was at 5 percent with black voters (the pollsters had changed its nonwhite sampling) and 18 percent with voters making under $50,000; Warren was at 18 and 19 percent with those groups. Sanders had led by 16 percentage points with voters under 50, and those voters have moved to Warren.

How much can one group of endorsements change that? The Sanders campaign is bullish.

President Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani have alleged without evidence that former vice president Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to quash a probe into the natural gas company on whose board his son sat. Former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists have widely disputed Trump's unsubstantiated theory.

But environmental groups, which are increasingly opposed to all fossil fuels at a time of heightened concern about climate change, are split over how to respond to the fact that a leading presidential candidate's son worked in the natural gas business. And Hunter Biden's work has put some of the former vice president's 2020 rivals in the awkward position of responding to whether they would want members of their own vice president's family to work at a foreign energy company.

Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings is serving as a backdrop of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of abusing his office for personal gain by pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart in a July 25 phone call to open an investigation into the Bidens.

Here are the facts: For five years, the younger Biden served on Burisma's board. The firm's owner came under scrutiny by authorities there, but Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the course of the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden separately pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, as The Post's Paul Sonne, Michael Kranish and Matt Viser report.

Some environmental groups drew a connection between Hunter Biden's role at the Ukraine gas company and energy policies promoted by his dad as vice president, which included helping Ukraine produce its own gas.

""It's not just Hunter — it's Vice President Biden's multitude of connections to energy experts who continue to push the false narrative that there's a place for gas in a clean energy future,"" Collin Rees, a campaigner for Oil Change U.S., wrote by email.

Rees, whose organization is pressing presidential candidates to renounce donations from fossil-fuel executives as part of a “No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge,"" noted that Biden attended a New York fundraiser last month hosted by Andrew Goldman, a businessman who helped start a natural gas company.

""Joe Biden's continued refusal to stand up to the fossil-fuel industry and make it crystal clear that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground and that gas is not a bridge fuel is troubling indeed,"" Rees added.

But other green groups are more reluctant to wade into the political thicket surrounding. The Sunrise Movement, which also has cornered candidates at events to ask them to sign the “No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge,"" declined to comment on Hunter Biden's job history. The Sierra Club also declined to comment.

Back in 2014, Joe Biden flew to Ukraine to announce a U.S. aide package meant to boost Ukrainian gas production. One of the goals was to wean the nation off of dependence on Russian fuel. ""Imagine where you’d be today if you were able to tell Russia: ‘Keep your gas,’” Biden told the Ukrainians.

“The global peddling of natural gas is a Democratic and a Republican problem,"" Karen Orenstein, deputy director of economic policy at Friends of the Earth, wrote by email. ""Exploitation of natural gas in Ukraine under the guise of so-called 'national security' promotes climate pollution in an age of climate emergency. The only way to promote real energy security is to work together with Europe to rapidly end our shared reliance on fossil fuels, and to help other countries to do the same.""

Now five years later, as a presidential candidate, Biden has made a series of commitments to shrink, rather than grow, the use of fossil fuels. Biden has called for the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and — in an major about-face from the Obama administration — has promised to ban new leases for coal, oil and gas extraction on federal land.

But Joe Biden has still stopped short of calling for nationwide bans on fracking and on fossil-fuel exports, as some of his Democratic rivals have.

Several fellow Democrats running against Biden for president, too, were weary of amplifying an unsubstantiated story about the Biden being pushed by Trump.

When asked by a reporter over the weekend if she would allow the son or daughter of her vice president to serve on the board of a foreign oil company, Sen. Kamala D. Harris said ""probably not.""

But the senator from California added that focusing on the Bidens is a ""distraction"" from the real issue, which is Trump's allegedly corrupt conduct.

""As far as I'm concerned, leave Joe Biden alone,"" Harris said. ""Leave him alone."" She added: ""I'm not going to be distracted by what this president is trying to play, which is a game, because he knows he's actually probably looking at an indictment.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) similarly has said she is uncertain whether a vice president's child could serve on a foreign company's board under her proposed ethics rules.

""I'd have to go back and look at the details of the plan,"" said Warren, who earlier this year introduced an anti-corruption bill that would make the vice president subject to conflict of interest restrictions.

A Warren spokesperson later told to The Post's Annie Linskey that the legislation ""doesn’t prevent any children of a VP from serving on a company’s board.""

— 2020 watch: In case you missed it, Warren and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer released the latest in a slew of plans on Friday:

Warren: The Massachusetts Democrat’s plan would reinstate the Office of Technology Assessment as a way to curb lobbying power. She cited the changing climate as one need for the independent congressional office, which was disbanded in the 1990s under then-House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). “Over the last 20 years, lobbying spending has grown much faster than Congress’s budget has. As the urgency of confronting climate change bears down upon us, fossil fuel companies spent more than twice as much on lobbying than they did 15 years ago,” she wrote in a Medium post. “… If the OTA had survived Gingrich’s purge, it would have provided Congress with a vital resource to counter the disinformation peddled by the fossil fuel industry and climate change deniers.”

OIL CHECK

— BP leader eyes exit: Bob Dudley, the chief executive at oil and gas giant BP, is planning to step down next year, “ending a tumultuous decade at the helm of the oil and gas company that swung from near collapse in 2010 to rapid growth today,” Reuters reports. No final date has been determined, but Dudley has mentioned the possibility of retiring numerous times in recent years.

The turnaround: Dudley took over in 2010 shortly after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which “shook the company to its core,” the executive told The Post's Steven Mufson last year. ""Since the blowout, BP has sold off $75 billion of assets to cover unprecedented government fines, private damage claims and legal bills,"" Mufson wrote in his 2018 profile of the oil giant. ""It has retooled facilities, ousted two top executives and been lucky with the ups and downs of oil prices. Now it is once again investing profitably in massive oil and natural gas projects, including a Caspian gas pipeline, wells offshore Egypt and the fracturing of shale gas rock formations in east Texas.""

Trump is an effective party recruiter — for Democrats. “More than one in four (27%) say they have become more likely to think of themselves as Democrats, fewer than one in five (17%) say they have become more likely to think of themselves as independents, and only 13% report they have become more likely to think of themselves as Republicans.”

While Trump’s approval remains underwater, Democrats should exercise caution in their choice of a presidential nominee. “Almost two-thirds (65%) of Americans say they are certain about the candidate they will support in November 2020. Nearly four in ten (37%) say they will support the Democratic candidate over President Donald Trump no matter who the Democrat is, and nearly three in ten (28%) say they will support Donald Trump no matter who becomes the Democratic nominee. Notably, one-third (33%) of Americans say their vote will depend on who wins the Democratic primary.” Moreover, opposition to Trump is more intense and fixed than is his support, “with three in four (75%) saying there is almost nothing Trump could do to win their approval. … Americans who approve of Trump’s job performance are more open to the idea of changing their mind: Two-thirds (66%) say he could do something to lose their approval.”

The good news for Democrats is the high percentage of Americans overall who agree with their progressive policy stances — “making college tuition free at public institutions (68%), making recreational use of marijuana legal (67%), and a ‘Medicare for All’ plan that would replace private health insurance with government-backed health insurance coverage for all Americans (63%). About one in three Americans strongly favor each of these proposals.”

Right now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) leads the Democratic field in net favorability among Democrats and Democratic leaners with 55 percent. He is followed by former vice president Joe Biden with 46 percent and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with 43 percent, then Sen. Kamala D. Harris (31 percent).

Whatever the issue (favorability, impeachment, personal conduct, stirring white nationalism), white evangelical Christians remain far more supportive of Trump than any other subset of the electorate. For example, “Nearly two-thirds (63%) of white evangelical Protestants say Trump has not damaged the dignity of the office. Majorities of all other major religious groups agree that Trump has damaged the dignity of the presidency.” Likewise, “Majorities of nearly every demographic group, with the exception of white evangelical Protestants and Republicans, say Trump’s conduct makes them less likely to support him.”

White evangelical Christians are much more likely to reflect male resentment (e.g., society is too feminine, society punishes men for being men) than any other group. In short, Trump (his personality, his prejudices, his anti-immigrant sentiment, his climate change denial, etc.) almost perfectly matches up with white evangelicals but runs counter to other groups in American society (e.g., nonwhites, non-Christians). His cultlike status among these voters contrasts with the animosity he engenders among most other segments of the population.

Opposition to child separation runs high (about 75 percent), although evangelicals are far less averse to it than are other Americans. “Nearly four in ten (39%) white evangelicals support this policy, compared to 57% who oppose this policy. By contrast, only 28% of white mainline Protestants, 22% of Hispanic Protestants and 18% of black Protestants.” A majority of Americans favor more restrictive immigration policies, but “white evangelical Protestants (85%) are more likely than white mainline Protestants (66%) to be in favor of placing restrictions on immigration, and both groups are remarkably more supportive of restrictive policies than are Hispanic Protestants (53%) and black Protestants (45%).” Big majorities think immigrants are hard-working and family-oriented, but white evangelicals are much less likely to believe so.

There are a few takeaways from the survey.

First, Trump (along with those who espouse his brand of right-wing nativism and know-nothingism) is hugely dependent on the overwhelming support of white evangelicals, but in doubling and tripling down on positions and conduct that pleases this core part of his base, he winds up turning off more of the electorate.

Second, that makes evangelicals out of step with the majority of Americans on everything from immigration to climate change to impeachment to beliefs about gender and race. If they feel like a minority on issues ranging from gender to climate change, they are. Their burning resentment toward “elites” masks a more fundamental alienation from a majority of all Americans.

AD

Third, Trump and the GOP’s hyper-dependence on white evangelicals is an electoral problem, given the declining number of white evangelicals who are aging and seeing significant drop off among millennials. Each election it becomes harder to win outside deep red environs.

AD

In sum, we may be “two Americas,” but they are not equal. Trump and Republicans’ segment is smaller than the rest and is shrinking over time. Republicans are playing a losing hand as the electorate as a whole becomes more diverse and identifies with progressives on policy and cultural issues. It turns out, math matters.

This time it was Sen. Elizabeth Warren fielding attacks from all sides as the Democratic candidates vigorously debated Medicare-for-all in their fourth primary debate.

Their differences over how to expand health coverage have been on display in all the previous debates, but last night the candidates especially tried to portray the Massachusetts senator who has been rising in the polls as cagey or extreme on the issue.

Despite the pressure, Warren again refused to say whether Medicare-for-all would result in higher taxes for the middle class or talk specifically about how it would eliminate employer-sponsored coverage for 160 million Americans. She notably vowed that her plan would not raise overall costs for the middle-class, and evaded the specific issue of taxes.

“So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families,” Warren said. “I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot.”

New York Times's Margot Sanger-Katz:

Warren is doing a careful dance here. Focusing on whose “costs” will go up under “Medicare for all,” and not saying whose taxes will be affected. — Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) October 16, 2019

CNN's MJ Lee:

The difference between basically every other policy plan that Warren is confident defending vs. Medicare for All? Medicare for All isn't Warren's own plan. She does not have a health care plan of her own. — MJ Lee (@mj_lee) October 16, 2019

HuffPost's Amanda Terkel:

It’s clear that Warren is the frontrunner now! Everyone is going after her. In the past debates, she was near the top, but didn’t have to take all the hits. — Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) October 16, 2019

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg slammed Warren for refusing to get specific about how she’d fund Medicare-for-all and for advocating a single, government plan everyone would have to enroll in.

“Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,” Buttigieg said. “No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Politico's Elena Schneider:

The Warren v. Buttigieg face-off is here.



Warren says Buttigieg's Medicare for all who want it ""is ""Medicare for all who can afford it, and that's the problem we've got."" — Elena Schneider (@ec_schneider) October 16, 2019

Even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) – the candidate Warren has most closely aligned with on Medicare-for-all – gave a subtle jab.

“I do think it’s appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up,” Sanders said. “They will go up significantly for the wealthy.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) suggested Warren wasn’t being “honest” in how she talks about the issue.

“At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said. “And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.”

Vox's Ezra Klein:

One difference between Sanders and Warren is that Sanders recognizes that if you want to build a much bigger social safety net, you need to be willing to argue that higher taxes are worth it, including for the middle class. He's right about that. — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) October 16, 2019

PBS News Hour's Yamiche Alcindor:

WOAH. ANOTHER BIG MOMENT.



Sen. Amy Klobuchar just accused Sen. Elizabeth Warren of essentially peddling a ""pipe dream"" with her healthcare plan rather than a plan that can be realistically implemented. — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) October 16, 2019

Compared to the first primary debate in June, the candidates by now have more clearly-defined positions on how to achieve universal health coverage. As in past debates, they were eager to differentiate themselves on exactly how they’d expand coverage to the uninsured and improve coverage for those who already have it.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has proposed a version of Medicare-for-all that would involve private insurers administering it. Buttigieg wants to keep workplace coverage but let anyone buy into Medicare, in his “Medicare-for-all-who-want-it” plan. Former vice president Joe Biden has laid out how he’d provide a government-backed plan through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Biden recited his now-familiar lines about expanding the ACA versus trying to overhaul the whole system. He also lobbed pointed attacks at Medicare-for-all, alleging it would raise taxes by about $5,000 a year for people making in between $50,000 and $75,000.

“On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them,” Biden said. “The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.”

Sanders and Warren, who are aligned on the most expansion version of Medicare-for-all, have faced tricky questions of how they’d pay for it and why they would need to do away with the private health insurance industry.

Their most effective response has been to point to systemic and widely-acknowledged problems in the country’s health-care system. Last night, Warren returned again and again to the theme of bankruptcy stemming from medical bills (we recently wrote a Health 202 about this very problem), saying she has heard from people with multiple sclerosis, diabetes and cancer about the costs they incurred.

“They all had great health insurance right at the beginning,” Warren said. “But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.”

Our Post colleague Robert Costa:

Warren continues to get a lot of space and time to flesh out position. She doesn't take on other candidates directly, sticks to policy. Keeps hammering her position. A reminder that her ascent in polls has come amid a message-centric strategy and not about big moments/sparring. — Robert Costa (@costareports) October 16, 2019

Here are some other key health-related moments from the debate:

CANDIDATES AND THEIR HEALTH: Sanders, 78, said he was “healthy, I’m feeling great,” when asked how he can assure voters he's fit to tackle the presidency after his heart attack earlier this month. He plugged an upcoming campaign rally in New York -- where, as our Post colleagues Sean Sullivan and Dave Weigel scoop, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plans to endorse the Vermont senator.

“I’ll be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,"" Sanders said. ""That is how I can reassure the American people.” He thanked people who supported him during his recovery. “Let me take this moment to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here for their love, for their prayers, and their well-wishes… I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Political strategist Caleb Hull:

Cory Booker: ""I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage... when looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.""

Booker: He's also in favor of medical marijuana.



""I'm not on it tonight,"" Sanders retorts. — Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 16, 2019

LA Times correspondent Matt Pearce:

""I'm healthy, I'm feeling great,"" says Sanders, to cheers from the audience. One of the bigger stories tonight (in my opinion) isn't really much of a story at all, which is that Sanders looks and sounds like he did before he had a heart attack. — Matt Pearce 🦅 (@mattdpearce) October 16, 2019

Biden, 76, vowed to release his medical records ahead of the Iowa caucuses in February. And 70-year-old Warren, when asked about her age, said: ""I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump or Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

ABORTION: Harris chimed in during the Medicare-for-all debate to point out a lack of questions about states passing new abortion restrictions.

Kamala Harris: ""It's not an exaggeration to say women will die — poor women, women of color will die — because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies"" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019

When asked about how the candidates would stop laws restricting abortion, Harris said under her administration, the Justice Department would review whether laws comply with Roe v. Wade, otherwise they wouldn’t go into effect.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) joined in: “We are seeing all over this country, women's reproductive rights under attack and... women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight."" Booker said he would create an Office of Reproductive Freedom, and called for codifying Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and Klobuchar also said they would codify Roe v. Wade.

Warren reminded people that even when abortions were illegal, women still had access to the procedure if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal.

Rep.Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) said the need for “safe, legal and rare” abortions was one area she agreed with Hillary Clinton. She said there should be limits on third-trimester abortions “unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.”

OPIOID CRISIS: Several candidates called for holding opioid executives accountable and sending them to prison for their role in the opioid crisis.

Harris said she thinks pharmaceutical executives should be locked up. “I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers,” she said. “They should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice understands that you want to deal with who is really a criminal.”

Castro said the executives “need to be held accountable not only financially but also with criminal penalties.”

Business executive Andrew Yang cited Ohio as an epicenter of the crisis, saying there was a “point when there were more opioid prescriptions in the state of Ohio than humans in the state of Ohio.” Our fact-checker colleague Salvador Rizzo reports that statistic was accurate. “Ohio had a peak of 102.4 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons in 2010, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Ohio’s rate has since declined. In 2017, it was 63.5 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons, but that was still higher than the U.S. average of 58.7,” Rizzo writes.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: Pete Buttigieg sharpened his aim at rivals Warren and Sanders with a new ad released ahead of last night's debate.

The ad, titled “Makes More Sense,” cites Buttigieg’s health-care plan, contrasting it with the Medicare-for-all proposal touted by Sanders and Warren and framing the South Bend, Ind. mayor as more moderate on the issue. It features political analysts and television anchors talking about his plan.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare-for-all, where private insurance is abolished,” one commentator says. The ad adds Buttigieg is “trying to focus on choice, not infringing on people’s freedom to make that decision voluntarily.”

—""Buttigieg’s campaign said he was not leveling personal attacks, only highlighting his policy differences with others in the field,"" our Post colleague Amy B Wang reports. ""But sometimes the attacks are fairly pointed. On health care, Buttigieg accuses Warren and Sanders of not trusting the American people to choose the right health care plans for themselves. Buttigieg’s plan would create a government-run 'public option' but would not abolish private insurance, allowing people to choose between the two.""

The Health 202 wrote last month that Buttigieg’s “Medicare-for-all-who-want-it” plan appears to be a riff off the Sanders plan, but actually builds on the Affordable Care Act and looks more like a public option, comparable to the public option plan laid out by Biden.

OOF: A group of state attorneys general failed in a last-minute bid to delay the landmark opioid trial set to begin next week amid discussions about a settlement deal with the nation's three largest drug distributors.

The state AGs told U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster they were trying to reach an $18 billion settlement with distributors McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, our Post colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Scott Higham, Sari Horwitz and Aaron C. Davis report.

Polster said during a hearing that jury selection will proceed today as scheduled. ""The state attorneys general have filed their own lawsuits against the drug industry for saturating their states with highly addictive pain pills,"" our colleagues write. ""... Lawyers representing the local communities said Tuesday night they are not part of the settlement talks with the distributors.""

The bellwether trial, meant to be a test case to determine how other lawsuits against the drug companies might play out, will begin in a Cleveland courtroom next week. There, jury selection will begin to pick the dozen people who will determine if the companies should be held responsible for the epidemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives and left millions addicted.

“Described as the most complex litigation ever, the trial will begin to sort out the welter of accusations over the crisis,” Lenny writes. “While six drug companies are defendants in the case, jurors also may hear blame cast widely on doctors, government agencies and perhaps even drug users themselves. The jury’s response will help decide who should bear the cost of one of this century’s worst public health crises.”

OUCH: More than 150 cases out of the more than 1,000 people who have been sickened by a vaping-related lung illness are teenagers under the age of 18.

The news has swept across social media platforms, as teenagers try to warn peers about the illness, sharing images of young patients in hospitals. Still, on those very platforms, others have mocked their classmates for quitting the use of e-cigarettes and vaping products and high school vape dealers have advertised their products.

“The posts offer a glimpse into the contradictory forces teens face: the draw of nicotine and marijuana, the pressure to fit in and be cool, the inclination to rebel — and now the potential that vaping, which has become central to adolescent culture in some places, could cause immediate and lethal harm,” our Post colleague Moriah Balingit reports. “…Interviews with pediatricians, public health officials and more than a dozen teenagers reveal that while many young people are trying to quit, others are resistant to the notion that vaping might be dangerous.”

Pediatricians are warning that even users who don’t acquire a lung injury could become addicted to the vaping products, as long-term effects are unknown. “But teens, like many adults, have cherry-picked information to justify continued use,” Moriah writes.

— There’s a dearth of women in top roles in the health-care industry, even as there are a lot of women who work in the industry overall. It has the highest share of women who work in entry-level roles, the Wall Street Journal’s Lauren Weber reports, citing data from LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co.

But women make up only 33 percent of the highest levels of the corporate ladder at a sample of 22 companies, and 75 percent of the employees at the lowest rungs of the ladder. That’s compared with men who make up 67 percent of the top leaders and 25 percent of entry-level workers.

The numbers are lower for women of color. Compared with white women, who make up 29 percent of top roles, women of color make up just 6 percent of C-suite positions.

Everyone gets a chance, but the septuagenarians go first. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) rehashes stuff she has said before about the Mueller report and the rule of law. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), recently recovered from a heart attack, looks well as he explains President Trump’s alleged crimes. Former vice president Joe Biden, coifed and tailored as if he just stepped out of a men’s store catalogue, can’t settle on whether Trump is “the most corrupt president in modern history” or “all of our history.”

AD

AD

5 minutes. Because everyone has basically the same answer on impeachment, the candidates search for ways to define their brands. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) quotes the author Maya Angelou. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) speaks about feelings and duty. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) says Trump is making “Russia great again.” Former housing secretary Julián Castro talks about Ohio job losses. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg gestures with his hands as he asks America to envision the day after Trump is pushed from office. “It starts out feeling like a happy thought,” he says. “But really think about where we’ll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.”

12 minutes. Gabbard says impeachment should not be partisan. Steyer tries to get applause by calling Trump a “criminal in the White House.” Yang uses the moment to blame Amazon, a company run by the owner of The Washington Post, for “closing 30 percent of America’s stores and malls” and paying no taxes. Former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.), in his trademark poetry-slam cadence, riffs on how Trump has betrayed those who have served the country in uniform.

16 minutes. Biden gets a question about his son Hunter, who got a job for a Ukrainian gas company while he held elected office — and whose dealings have become a focus for Trump’s attacks on the former vice president. “I want to point out there’s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you,” Cooper says, before asking if it was wrong for family members of vice presidents to take jobs like that. Biden doesn’t seem to want to answer. Instead, he says no one did anything wrong and he never talked business with his son. “This is about Trump’s corruption. That’s what we should be focusing on,” Biden says.

AD

AD

18 minutes. Cooper tries to get Sanders to bite on Hunter Biden. Sanders responds by talking about “the pain of the working class of this country.”

20 minutes. Now it is Warren’s time in the frying pan. Marc Lacey, an editor at the New York Times, which is co-hosting the debate with CNN, asks the question Warren won’t answer. Will she raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all? Warren still won’t answer. Instead, she talks about the “70,000 selfies” she has taken with voters, which really aren’t selfies because someone else is holding the camera.

21 minutes. Lacey tries again, asking if she should acknowledge what is obvious. Warren, a former high school debate champion, responds this time with a double negative. “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,” she says. She won’t say taxes.

AD

AD

22 minutes. Nearly half the people onstage are ready to pounce. Some want to debate the policy. Others want to turn Warren’s strategy of not admitting what everyone knows into a proxy for her character. “Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer,” says Buttigieg. Warren bites back by saying the mayor’s plan — Medicare-for-all who want it — is really “Medicare-for-all who can afford it.” Snap.

25 minutes. After a quick rebuttal that notes his plan’s subsidies, Buttigieg deftly pivots back to his opening theme. Warren, he says, wants to disrupt and divide the day after Trump leaves office. “Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all?” he asks. Sanders chimes in to say taxes will go up under Medicare-for-all. “Well, at least that’s a straightforward answer,” says Buttigieg, getting in yet another dig at Warren.

26 minutes. CNN cuts to a shot of the four in the center of the stage, Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren, which is a nice compliment for Buttigieg and a dismissal of Harris, who has recently faltered in the polls. Both Klobuchar and Biden chime in to hit the same points on Warren’s refusal to say what her policy would do. They score blow after blow, and in response, Warren keeps lapsing into her stump speech, talking about how the middle class has been hollowed out. Maybe this strategy worked better in high school.

AD

AD

31 minutes. Sanders gives Warren a break. He attacks Biden for not backing his bill. He says 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical costs, a contested statistic. Then, he accuses Biden of a lack of courage. Biden smiles, but before he can respond Harris breaks the spell by changing the topic. She says its time to talk about “women’s reproductive health care.”

33 minutes. The resulting applause serves as a palate cleanser. But the moderators move on. Now everyone is talking about robots taking jobs. Yang disagrees with Sanders about whether the best response is more government employment or cash subsidies. But then, just as the robot conversation gets going, Booker chimes in to sayHarris is right about reproductive health care. “Women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies,” he says.

37 minutes. CNN’s Erin Burnett tries to get the topic back on robots and jobs. Warren talks about bad trade deals. Castro talks about infrastructure investment and a Green New Deal. Yang challenges Warren for not adopting his universal basic income plan, which would pay adults $1,000 a month. He mentions the self-driving trucks and self-serve kiosks at McDonald’s. Warren responds by saying she supports increases in Social Security payments. The conversation continues for a while, with several candidates endorsing stronger unions and better trade deals.

AD

AD

46 minutes. Burnett appears to try to set a trap. She asks Sanders if he thinks billionaires should be taxed into millionaire status. Steyer, a billionaire who has joined the debate stage for the first time, is just a few feet away. “We cannot afford a billionaire class,” Sanders responds. But Steyer is ready. “First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right,” he says. He flips class politics on its head and makes the case that he is as radical on economic inequality as the Democratic socialist.

49 minutes. But Warren is not ready to give up the class struggle. She asks why everyone on the stage besides Sanders and herself thinks “it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?” Biden takes offense. “No one is supporting billionaires,” he says. So does Buttigieg, who generally sounds the best in these debate settings. Here, he tries some next-level mental jujitsu. He says people in the Midwest have come to distrust politicians who focus on “who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing.”

53 minutes. Klobuchar does not want to lose the pile-on-Warren thread. “I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,” she says. “Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.” Warren is dismissive, without actually engaging with Klobuchar. “Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren says. Klobuchar is ready. “Simply because you have different ideas doesn’t mean you’re [not] fighting for regular people,” she says.

AD

AD

57 minutes. A discussion continues about the wealth tax embraced by Warren. Yang likes the idea, but he says it has failed in lots of places. O’Rourke says it is part of a solution, but worries that Warren is being “punitive.” This gives Warren a chance to say she is “really shocked” that anyone would consider her punitive and to lapse into another part of her stump speech, where she says the wealthy got help from public infrastructure and need to “pitch in” to pay some of it back.

63 minutes. “We’ve got to take a quick break,” says Cooper. Only two hours left. Democracy is hard.

68 minutes. We’re back with foreign policy. The focus in on Trump’s recent decision to pull troops out of Syria. Everyone on the stage is against either the withdrawal or the way Trump handled the withdrawal, leaving behind former Kurdish allies to face Turkish forces alone. Biden seems particularly worked up. “This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,” he says.

AD

AD

70 minutes. Gabbard, the only candidate who raises doubts about reports of Syrian chemical weapons use on her campaign website, scrambles the conversation by blaming the Turkish slaughter of Kurds on “the regime change war that we’ve been waging.” The Syrian civil war started before U.S. troops arrived, and the U.S. troops in the country were not focused on changing the Syrian regime. Gabbard goes on to say accusations that she is Russian asset are “completely despicable.” She repeats the phrase “regime change war” four more times.

73 minutes. The other candidates work to distance themselves from Gabbard. Warren says she wants to get out of Syria but in a smarter way, and she appears to be reading talking points from a piece of paper on her podium. Buttigieg, who is delivering his most forceful debate performance of the year, calls Gabbard “dead wrong.” This prompts an odd exchange where Gabbard and Buttigieg debate the difference between “regime change war” and “endless war.” “What is an endless war if it’s not a regime change war?” Gabbard asks.

78 minutes. The discussion turns to the U.S. standing in the world and the trust of its allies. Candidates agree that Trump has not been good for either. Several also point to growing Russian geopolitical strength.

AD

AD

91 minutes. Cooper changes the topic to gun violence, pitting O’Rourke and Buttigieg against each other. O’Rourke wants a mandatory buyback of assault weapons, although he offers only vague notions of how it will be enforced. Buttigieg thinks the proposal could prevent other new gun regulations from becoming law by polarizing the debate. The back and forth gets a bit nasty. “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,” Buttigieg says to O’Rourke, who responds by saying Buttigieg’s position is a “slap in the face” to gun violence survivor groups. The other candidates also weigh in on guns.

105 minutes. The topic changes to opioid policy. Several candidates say they support strong enforcement against pharmaceutical companies that flooded the market with drugs. Yang and O’Rourke says they support decriminalizing small amounts of opiates. When O’Rourke says marijuana should be legalized, Yang chimes in. “Yes. Preach, Beto,” he says.

112 minutes. Sanders, 78, gets a question about his age and his health, given the heart attack. He answers by bragging about his youthful allies. “Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we’re having in Queens, New York,” he says. “We’re going to have a special guest at that event.” The guest is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), 30, who, The Washington Post later reports, will be endorsing him at the rally. Sanders also thanks all the well-wishers during his illness. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening,” he says.

115 minutes. Biden, 76, responds to the age question by saying his experience is one of his best qualities. Warren, 70, basically dares anyone to keep up with her. “I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone,” she says.

119 minutes. Gabbard, 38, gets the age question and answers by saying that as a military veteran she is ready to be commander in chief. Then she tries to ask Warren to justify her qualifications to lead the military, but the moderators cut her off and go to another commercial break.

124 minutes. And we’re back. The topic is big tech and whether companies like Facebook and Amazon need to be broken up. Most are leaning that way, although the details differ somewhat. Warren is particularly bothered by Amazon’s ability to gather information from vendors on its network and then use that information to compete with those vendors. “Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time,” she says.

132 minutes. Harris takes a question about Facebook and turns it into a question for Warren about Twitter. She asks Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump’s account for violating the rules. Like other platforms, Twitter tends to give public officials more leeway to be abusive. “No,” says Warren. “No? Wow,” says Harris, looking shocked. “You can’t say you’re for corporate responsibility if it doesn’t apply to everyone.”

139 minutes. The previously scheduled reproductive health section of the evening arrives. The candidates support reproductive health and are unhappy with the Trump administration.

145 minutes. Buttigieg has spent much of the night telling other candidates that they are too polarizing, but now he revels in the fact that he was the first candidate to prominently embrace the idea of overhauling the Supreme Court to prevent a conservative majority. “Some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate,” he brags. He hasn’t settled on how he would “depoliticize” the court, but options include term limits, rotating justices off and increasing the number from 9 to 15. Castro and Warren say they are interested in the ideas.

149 minutes. Biden gets a question about whether his platform is bold enough. He boasts of all he has accomplished and pivots to attack Warren and Sanders. “Both are being vague on the issue of Medicare-for-all,” he says, trying to bring back the argument from earlier. Sanders is happy to oblige, listing off some of Biden’s less popular accomplishments. “You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA,” he says.

152 minutes. Rather than respond on Medicare-for-all, Warren begins listing off all the things she got done while working in the Obama administration fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This leads Biden to praise her. “I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden says.

153 minutes. Warren can’t manage to return the compliment, at least not directly. “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it,” she says.

154 minutes. Buttigieg does the meta-thing that politicians do when they want to make it look like they are not politicians, calling the debate between Biden and Warren a “false choice.” “If I had a buck for every argument that I’ve witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody,” he says, delivering what is clearly a rehearsed line. “We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I’ve been alive.”

156 minutes. Klobuchar weighs in to say bold doesn’t matter if you don’t win, and she knows how to win in the Midwest.

157 minutes. Cooper asks Sanders why his approach is more likely to beat Trump. “Here’s the radical reason,” says Sanders. “It’s what the American people want.” This is not yet clear.

160 minutes. A final break. Almost there.

165 minutes. And we’re back. The final question is for everyone. Each candidate is asked to talk about a surprising friendship. Castro talks vaguely about people he has known who are different from him. Gabbard talks about her friendship with former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). Klobuchar talks about former senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died last year. “I miss him every day,” she says. Steyer talks about a woman he met in South Carolina who is fighting for cleaner water. O’Rourke talks about his former colleague Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.). Booker talks about bible study in the office of Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). Yang talks about a Trump-voting trucker he met and turned into a supporter. Harris talks about Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Buttigieg talks about the friends he met serving in Afghanistan. Sanders talks about Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Warren talks about Charles Fried, a Republican solicitor general who helped her get a job. Biden talks about McCain as well."

But it’s unclear where they originated.

Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged during a news conference in Rome that he listened in on the call, on which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.

AD

Current and former U.S. officials also told The Washington Post that Trump involved Vice President Pence in efforts to pressure Zelensky at a time when the president was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to Biden.

The former vice president, meanwhile, told reporters at a forum on guns that the president’s actions were “beyond anything I frankly thought he would do.” And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a television interview that she believes Trump is “scared” of the inquiry.

8:50 p.m.: CNN: Giuliani says some of the inspector general documents were from him

Giuliani told CNN that at least some of the conspiracy theory-filled documents that the inspector general showed Congress were his.

He said he sent Pompeo in March information outlining allegations against Biden and the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Masha Yovanovitch based off interviews he’d done with Ukrainian officials.

7:00 p.m.: Democratic chairmen say State inspector general’s ‘urgent’ documents were a packet of debunked conspiracy theories

The State Department inspector general, who met privately with House and Senate committees, handed over documents that include disinformation about former vice president Joe Biden’s son and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Masha Yovanovitch, but it’s unclear where the documents originated.

AD

House committee chairmen Eliot Engel of Foreign Affairs, Adam Schiff of Intelligence and Elijah E. Cummings of Oversight, released a joint statement about their committee staffs’ briefing with Inspector General Steve Linick.

AD

“The documents provided by the Inspector General included a package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations in an envelope marked ‘White House’ and containing folders labeled ‘Trump Hotel.’ These documents also reinforce concern that the President and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the President’s personal political interests,” they wrote.

Sen. Robert Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also released a statement about the pages received from the intelligence community’s top watchdog.

AD

“We are just beginning to examine the documents provided by the State Department Inspector General, but they appear to contain long-debunked theories and false statements about the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and one of President Trump’s political opponents,” Menendez said. “These documents provide further evidence of a concerted, external effort to conduct a disinformation campaign against a career U.S ambassador, who has been the subject of baseless attacks, including by the President himself.”

AD

Some were let down by the inspector general’s big reveal, which came about because he requested an urgent meeting to discuss the documents, because there was no information about where the packet came from or for whom it was intended.

6:50 p.m.: GOP Rep. Upton supports an inquiry, but not one with impeachment in front of its name.

AD

Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, a moderate Republican who has been critical of President Trump in the past, said Wednesday that he supports an inquiry into the president’s actions pertaining to Trump’s controversial July call with the Ukrainian president, but not an impeachment inquiry.

“Let’s really look at all the details, ask lots of questions and see where it takes us,” Upton told NPR’s Michigan station.

AD

“So you’re supportive of the idea that there needs to be this inquiry. You’re not questioning that,” a reporter clarified.

“Yeah, I want the answers to the questions that need to be raised,” Upton said.

But when pressed later on whether that meant he was supportive of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry of Trump, Upton’s spokesman said, “he does not” and pointed to other comments made by the congressman that parse his desire for information about what Trump did with a formal impeachment inquiry.

6:15 p.m.: Trump on Schiff: ‘They should look at him for treason’

Trump on Wednesday renewed his attacks on Schiff by arguing that the California Democrat should be tried for treason — which is defined as aiding an enemy with which the United States is at war.

AD

“It should be criminal,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, referring to Schiff’s characterization of his phone call with Zelensky at a hearing last week. “It should be treasonous. … He should resign from office in disgrace, and frankly, they should look at him for treason.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump’s assertion that Schiff committed treason. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump has directed his administration to pursue legal action against Schiff.

AD

The U.S. Constitution defines treason as the act of someone who, “owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere.”

AD

While the common usage of the term can be very broad, the legal definition of treason is limited to Americans who act on behalf of a country with which the United States is at war. There are fewer than three dozen treason convictions in U.S. history, including during World War II and the Whiskey Rebellion.

6 p.m.: Trump involved Pence in efforts to press Ukraine’s leader, though aides say vice president was unaware of pursuit for dirt on Bidens

Trump repeatedly involved Pence in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine at a time when the president was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to a Democratic rival, current and former U.S. officials said.

AD

Trump instructed Pence not to attend the inauguration of Zelensky in May — an event White House officials had pushed to put on the vice president’s calendar — at a time when Ukraine’s new leader was seeking recognition and support from Washington, the officials said.

Months later, the president used Pence to tell Zelensky that U.S. aid was still being withheld while demanding more aggressive action on corruption, officials said. At that time — after Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy — the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

4:45 p.m.: Biden: ‘It’s way beyond anything I frankly thought he would do.’

Biden told reporters that he was surprised that Trump asked a foreign leader for help getting information that could damage his presidential campaign, saying, “It’s way beyond anything I frankly thought he would do.”

Biden, who spoke to reporters at a forum on gun violence in Las Vegas, was told that the president that afternoon had referred to Biden and his son Hunter as “stone cold crooked.” Asked whether he has spoken to his son about any of the controversy, Biden said they’d “communicated a couple times.”

“Look, the issue is — this president of the United States engaged in something apparently that is close to, well, engaged in activity which, at minimum, gives a lot of running room for the Russians and Ukraine, and I think we should just focus on — he’s the issue,” Biden said. “Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what’s that fellow’s name? Rudy? … Giuliani?”

4:15 p.m.: Buttigieg and Castro dodge questions about whether they’d allow their vice president’s child to serve on a foreign board

Pete Buttigieg and Julián Castro, both 2020 candidates, were asked whether they’d allow the son or daughter of their vice president to serve on a foreign board as former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter did in Ukraine.

Both candidates dismissed the question as doing Trump’s bidding.

“So one thing that is really important right now is to deny this president to change the subject, and the subject is that the president confessed on national television to an abuse of power. Let’s deal with that and not get caught in the shiny objects he’s going to throw out,” Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., said.

Castro, who was housing and urban development secretary in the Obama administration, said the question allows Trump to “use the same playbook against Joe Biden as he used against Hillary Clinton.”

“He’s trying to besmirch the reputation of an honorable public servant who has given a lot of honest years of public service so that he can try and win a narrow electoral college victory,” Castro said.

Buttigieg and Castro each spoke to reporters after speaking at a forum on gun violence. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) were asked about impeachment and their role as jurors if the Senate holds trial, but not the specific question related to Hunter Biden.

3:30 p.m.: White House will preserve records of Trump’s communications, Justice Department says

Justice Department attorneys promised a federal judge Wednesday that the White House will not destroy records of the president’s calls and meetings with foreign leaders while the court weighs a lawsuit brought by historians and watchdog groups.

In a two-page filing, Justice Department lawyer Kathryn L. Wyer told a federal judge in Washington that the Trump administration and executive office of the president “voluntarily agree … to preserve the material at issue pending” litigation.

The filing came after U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of Washington, D.C., on Tuesday set a 3 p.m. deadline for the government after the suing groups requested a temporary restraining order in a lawsuit filed in May to compel the administration to comply with the federal Presidential Records Act.

Three organizations — government watchdog groups Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, and National Security Archive, and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations — alleged that the White House was failing to create and save records as required of Trump’s meetings and communications with foreign leaders.

The lawsuit preceded the current storm surrounding a Democratic House impeachment inquiry into the White House. However, the plaintiffs on Tuesday asked Jackson for an emergency order, saying the whistleblower’s complaint and the White House’s subsequent’s admissions exposed record keeping practices “specifically designed to conceal the president’s abuse of his power,” CREW said in a statement.

The Justice Department has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, saying appeals courts have precluded courts from weighing in on presidents’ compliance with the archiving law, “not to mention the President’s broad authority to negotiate with foreign leaders.”

3:15 p.m.: Trump doesn’t answer when asked what he wanted from Ukraine on Bidens

During Wednesday’s joint news conference, Trump refused to answer what exactly he wanted from the Ukrainian president regarding Joe and Hunter Biden.

Instead, Trump ignored the question and focused his answer on why he held back military aid to Ukraine, citing, as he has in the past, corruption in Ukraine and the unsubstantiated claim that the United States is the “only one who gives the big money to Ukraine.”

When Reuters’s Jeff Mason tried again and again to ask the Biden-specific question, Trump became angry and demanded that Mason “not be rude” and instead ask a question of the Finnish president. When Mason pressed him, Trump responded that “Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,” then leveled his oft-made attack against the “fake news” media.

3 p.m.: With no evidence, Trump accuses Schiff of having helped write whistleblower complaint

At a fiery joint news conference late Wednesday afternoon with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, Trump continued to lash out at Schiff, accusing him, with no evidence, of having helped write the whistleblower’s complaint.

Trump made the comment in response to a question about a New York Times report stating that Schiff had learned the outlines of the whistleblower’s concerns days before the individual filed a formal complaint.

“Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before,” Trump said of Schiff. “I’d go a step further. I think he probably helped write it, okay? That’s what the word is. … He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.”

Schiff said in a statement ahead of the news conference that “at no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance,” and that his panel did not receive the complaint until the night before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified last Thursday.

The whistleblower first contacted the Intelligence Committee “for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community,” Schiff said.

“This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee’s unique oversight role and responsibilities,” he said, adding that “consistent with the Committee’s long-standing procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel.”

2:10 p.m.: Pelosi said Trump ‘scared’ of impeachment inquiry

Pelosi said during a television interview Wednesday that she believes Trump is “scared” of the impeachment inquiry being led by House Democrats.

“I think the president knows the argument that can be made against him, and he’s scared,” Pelosi said in an interview with ABC News, excerpts of which were released Wednesday afternoon. “And so he’s trying to divert attention from that to where [he’s] standing in the way of legislation.”

ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Pelosi whether Trump had fear in his voice when the two spoke last week before her announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry in response to the whistleblower’s complaint about Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“I saw the surprise in his voice that he didn’t understand that I thought what he did was wrong,” Pelosi said. “That he was undermining our national security, that he was undermining our Constitution by his actions, and he was undermining the integrity of our elections. He just didn’t see it.”

1:30 p.m.: California’s governor offers a rejoinder to Trump

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) took to Twitter to respond to Trump’s comments about him during a 13-minute stretch of Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Niinistö in which they fielded questions from reporters.

In the midst of insults directed at Pelosi and Schiff, Trump also derided Newsom as “a do-nothing” as he complained about a California law that would keep him off the primary ballot in the state next year if he doesn’t publicly release his taxes.

“Hello @realDonaldTrump...heard you just gave me a shout out in the Oval Office,” Newsom tweeted. “Actually watched your press conference — mainly just feel bad for the poor President of Finland who had to endure that. Today, we are all Sauli Niinistö.”

12:50 p.m.: Trump says identity of the whistleblower’s sources should be public

Trump, during an event in the Oval Office, called for the identity of those who provided information to the whistleblower to be publicly disclosed.

“This country has to find out who that person was, because that person’s a spy, in my opinion,” Trump told reporters while visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö looked on.

The whistleblower said his complaint was based on conversations with more than a half dozen U.S. officials.

In his remarks Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that there is value in protecting the identity of whistleblowers in some cases.

“I think a whistleblower should be protected if the whistleblower’s legitimate,” he said.

Trump also expanded on grievances aired earlier Wednesday on Twitter and took repeated shots at Schiff and Pelosi.

The president called Schiff “a low life” and a “shifty dishonest guy” and again called for him to resign.

Among other things, Trump took issue with Schiff having criticized Pompeo, saying “that guy couldn’t carry his blank strap.” Trump said he was trying to sanitize a common phrase about carrying a jock strap.

Trump suggested Pelosi should focus on her San Francisco-area congressional district, where he said there are people living in tents and “people dying in squalor.”

12:15 p.m.: State Department employees feel caught in the middle, diplomat says

Many State Department employees feel that they are caught in the middle of a political battle between the agency and House committees, said a U.S. diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment frankly about the adverse impact on morale.

Career Foreign Service officers are expected to follow the direction of State Department leadership and respond to congressional requests. It may not be possible to do both now.

“People are not politicized, and they’re very anxious not to be,” the diplomat said, referring to a number of clashes, including the impeachment inquiry, the pressure on Ukraine that led to the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Kiev and a reopened investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. “They want to do their jobs, serve their country and not be pulled into this.”

The diplomat has not spoken to anyone who feels bullied and intimidated, as Pompeo characterized the reaction to congressional outreach.

But the diplomat said employees expect Pompeo to defend them more vociferously than he has so far. The gold standard, still recalled with admiration in Foggy Bottom, the diplomat said, was set by George Shultz when he was secretary of state. In 1985, he threatened to resign over a Reagan administration proposal to require lie detector tests for all employees with access to highly classified information.

“The idea is that the secretary of state should stand up for them,” the diplomat said. Of Pompeo, he added: “There have been some generic comments, but nothing specific. The expectation is he should say more, and do more.”

11:50 a.m.: Trump insults Pelosi and Schiff, uses profanity to describe inquiry

Trump continued to hurl insults at Pelosi and Schiff as they conducted their news conference, and he later referred to the impeachment inquiry as “BULLSHIT.”

Writing on Twitter, Trump dismissed comments by Pelosi that House Democrats continue to want to work with the White House on trade and lowering prescription drug prices.

“She is incapable of working on either,” Trump said of Pelosi. “It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!”

Trump also sought to make the case that Schiff compares unfavorably to Pompeo.

“Adam B. Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,” Trump tweeted. “For a lowlife like Schiff, who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me, to demean a First in Class at West Point, is SAD!”

At a hearing last week, Schiff presented an embellished version of Trump’s phone call with Zelensky. He later said it was meant as a parody and said that should have been apparent to Trump.

Shortly after the new conference wrapped up, Trump returned to Twitter.

“The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306,” he wrote, referring to the electoral college results in the election. “Get a better candidate this time, you’ll need it!”

Trump’s tweet did not accurately convey the final electoral college results. Because of “faithless electors” who ended up voting for other people, Clinton’s final electoral college tally was 227, reduced from 232, and Trump’s went from 306 to 304.

11:30 a.m.: Schiff says, ‘We’re not fooling around here’

Schiff warned the White House on Wednesday that stonewalling could lead to an additional article of impeachment on obstruction of justice.

“We’re not fooling around here,” Schiff said as he appeared with Pelosi at a news conference on Capitol Hill shortly after House Democrats announced that they would subpoena the White House for documents. The subpoena will go out this week or next, Schiff said.

Democrats, he added, “are deeply concerned about Secretary Pompeo’s effort now to potentially interfere with witnesses whose testimony is needed before our committee.”

Pelosi said Democrats “place ourselves in a time of urgency” and observed that the country’s founders never thought they would have a president “kick those guardrails” of checks and balances provided by the Constitution.

She noted that “we have to give the president the chance to exonerate himself,” but so far, he’s described his actions as “perfect.”

11:20 a.m.: Trump accuses Democrats of trying to hurt the country

Trump asserted Wednesday that the stock market was going down because of the impeachment inquiry and accused House Democrats of trying to deliberately hurt the county.

He latest tweet came as Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) held a news conference on Capitol Hill.

“All of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere, is driving the Stock Market, and your 401K’s, down,” Trump tweeted. “But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!”

10:35 a.m.: Trump attacks Democrats ahead of Pelosi news conference

Trump went on Twitter to attack House Democrats shortly before Pelosi was scheduled to hold a news conference on Capitol Hill with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

In a pair of tweets, Trump renewed his call for Schiff to resign and attacked Democrats more broadly as “Do Nothing Democrats.”

At a hearing last week, Schiff presented an embellished version of Trump’s phone call with Zelensky. He later said it was meant as a parody and said that should have been apparent to Trump.

“Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of, after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect), fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress, as though mine! He is sick!” Trump tweeted.

He also shared a quote from Jeanne Zaino, a political science professor at Iona College in New York state, who had appeared as a guest on Fox News.

“Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats haven’t met the standards of impeachment. They have to be very careful here,” read the quote.

10:30 a.m.: House Democrats to subpoena White House for documents in its impeachment inquiry focused on Ukraine

In a memo issued Wednesday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said that the White House’s “flagrant disregard of multiple voluntary requests for documents — combined with stark and urgent warnings from the Inspector General about the gravity of these allegations — have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.”

The subpoena will be issued Friday, according to Cummings’s memo.

The memo said the subpoena will seek documents that the committee first requested on Sept. 9.

9:30 a.m.: Eric Trump cites Republican fundraising as he taunts Democrats

The president’s son Eric Trump went on Twitter on Wednesday morning to taunt Democrats for their impeachment inquiry.

In a tweet, he attached an Associated Press news story about Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee having raised a record $125 million in the third quarter of the year.

“This is what happens when you manufacture nonsense... the American people see right through it. Keep it up @SpeakerPelosi,” Eric Trump wrote.

9:15 a.m.: State Department’s inspector general headed to Capitol Hill for afternoon meeting

Steve Linick, the State Department’s inspector general, plans to meet with staffers of key House and Senate committees Wednesday at 3 p.m. at his request.

The committees were notified Tuesday that Linick wants “to discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine,” according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

The offer by Linick’s office, which operates mostly independently from the State Department and is responsible for investigating abuse and mismanagement, comes amid a standoff between Pompeo and House Democrats, who are demanding documents and testimony on Ukraine-related matters for their impeachment inquiry.

Linick’s office “obtained the documents from the acting legal adviser of the Department of State,” the letter said. The inspector general doesn’t have to seek Pompeo’s approval to approach Congress with information, especially if it is not classified.

It is unclear exactly what Linick will provide the committees, which include the panels in charge of foreign relations, intelligence, appropriations and oversight in the House and Senate. But the demand for any credible information related to Ukraine and the State Department is at a fever pitch as Democrats seek to build the case for Trump’s ouster based on his dealings with Ukraine’s leadership.

9 a.m.: Trump focuses on other issues in first tweets of the day

Unlike previous days, impeachment did not dominate Trump’s early activity on Twitter on Wednesday.

He instead turned to other topics, including his promised border wall and a federal judge’s order to block a California law that would require Trump to release his tax returns for access to the state’s primary election ballot.

“I won the right to be a presidential candidate in California, in a major Court decision handed down yesterday,” Trump wrote. “It was filed against me by the Radical Left Governor of that State to tremendous Media hoopla. The VICTORY, however, was barely covered by the Fake News. No surprise!”

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said the state would appeal the ruling.

In early tweets, Trump also urged Louisiana voters to pick a Republican candidate in the state’s gubernatorial primary on Oct. 12. Candidates from both parties compete in the state’s “jungle primary.”

8:15 a.m.: Former staff members say it’s unusual for a secretary of state to listen in on a call with leader of small nation

Former staff members who worked on foreign leader calls said it is very unusual for a secretary of state to listen in on calls with leaders from a country as small as Ukraine.

Partly it is because the secretary of state’s schedule is very busy and rarely aligns with the president’s schedule of routine calls to heads of state, so they arrange only to be on major foreign leader conversations.

When Rex Tillerson was secretary of state, for example, he would coordinate plans to listen in on Trump’s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The former staffers on the National Security Council said Pompeo’s presence on this call suggests the subject or the purpose of the call had high importance to the president, and thus to him. The former staffers spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more candidly.

7:15 a.m.: Pompeo confirms he was on Trump’s July call with Zelensky

Pompeo acknowledged publicly for the first time Wednesday that he was on the July call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine.

Asked about the episode during a news conference in Rome, Pompeo said, “I was on the phone call.”

In response to a multipart question, he did not say whether he was comfortable with Trump’s pressing of Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.

Pompeo said the call focused on issues such as the threat that Russia poses to Ukraine and the need for Ukraine to root out corruption.

He said the United States would consider to pursue those issues “even while all this noise is going on.”

During a Sept. 22 appearance on ABC News’s “This Week,” Pompeo was asked what he knew about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky following an initial Wall Street Journal report that the call was part of a whistleblower complaint.

Pompeo responded by saying he hadn’t seen the whistleblower report. He later said he had seen a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister that there was no pressure applied on Zelensky. Pompeo made no mention of being on the call.

During his news conference Wednesday, Pompeo also repeated his claims from a letter on Tuesday that House Democratic staffers have been seeking to intimidate State Department officials in their efforts to learn more about Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“We won’t tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees. That’s unacceptable, and it’s not something that I’m going to permit to happen.” Pompeo said.

6:30 a.m.: Country to hear directly from Trump, Pelosi on Wednesday

The country will hear directly from the two leading figures in the impeachment drama — Trump and Pelosi — at separately scheduled news conferences on Wednesday.

Pelosi plans to hold a news conference on Capitol Hill at 10:45 a.m. She will be accompanied by Schiff, who has become the public face for Democrats in the impeachment inquiry.

Trump, meanwhile, has a 2 p.m. joint news conference scheduled with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, who is visiting the White House on Wednesday. Trump is certain to get questions from U.S. journalists about the impeachment drive.

6:15 a.m.: Critics blast Trump for calling his impeachment inquiry a ‘COUP’

Trump claimed he was a victim of a coup d’etat on Tuesday night, continuing his dramatic rhetoric that has drawn fierce pushback from legal scholars and Democrats since the House impeachment inquiry began last week.

“As I learn more and more each day,” he wrote on Twitter, “I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of the United States of America!”

Critics disputed the president’s tweet by pointing to basic definitions of a coup d’etat, a violent illegal overthrow of the government by an opposing group, and impeachment, a legal process laid out in the Constitution. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, even suggested Trump should not be allowed to make such a remark on Twitter, sharing his “COUP” tweet with CEO Jack Dorsey.

6 a.m.: Giuliani suggests suing Democrats over Ukraine probe

On Tuesday night, Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed an unusual legal strategy in response to the ongoing investigation into President Trump’s dealings in Ukraine: suing Democratic members of Congress.

Speaking on the Fox News show “The Ingraham Angle,” Trump’s personal attorney said that he “had a couple of talks” with attorneys amid the accelerating impeachment probe and a House subpoena for his own personal records concerning Ukraine. Their recommendation, Giuliani said, was “that we should bring a lawsuit on behalf of the president and several people in the administration, maybe even myself as a lawyer, against the members of Congress individually for violating constitutional rights, violating civil rights.”

Host Laura Ingraham noted that Giuliani’s suggestion was “novel,” and that congressional immunity prevents House members from being sued for anything they say on the floor. But outside those parameters, Giuliani argued, they could be held liable for forming a “conspiracy” to deprive the president of his constitutional rights.

She gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is “too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.” And she doesn’t think the same country that elected Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.

“I don’t think a woman would win,” said Beck, 68. “I just saw how they beat up on Hillary Clinton, and I’m afraid they’re going to do the same thing to [Warren].”

Johnny James, 53, of Hampton County, S.C., said that despite Warren’s ability to attract big crowds, he prefers Biden. “He’s already seasoned,” James said. “He knows the Washington game.”

Republicans have stepped up their attacks on Biden in recent weeks, noting that his son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian company while Biden was spearheading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy. But many Democrats continue to consider Biden to have the best chance of defeating Trump, and for a significant portion that is the overriding factor.

Shedron Williams, a state representative from Hampton, S.C., predicted that “Biden is going to do well in South Carolina.” Williams has not endorsed the former vice president, but said he continues to be popular among black voters.

“Whoever is going to win South Carolina, it’s going to take the African American vote,” Williams said.

Polls back up that contention. In South Carolina, 37 percent of Democrats in a recent CNN poll said they support Biden, who leads Warren by more than 20 percentage points in the state.

The ongoing support for Biden has emerged as one of the campaign’s central story lines, even as he’s come under attack from rivals such as Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) for his onetime work with segregationists, and as former Housing secretary Julián Castro has made comments that struck some as questioning Biden’s mental acuity.

AD

AD

Some of Biden’s rivals hope that if he stumbles in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary, Democrats in states like South Carolina, which votes a short time later, will reconsider their support.

But James noted that South Carolina is the first primary state with a significant number of African American voters and said he would consider Biden the best candidate even if he doesn’t win any primary states before South Carolina.

“You can come in second and still be stronger than the first horse,” James said. “Even if someone else wins [Iowa or New Hampshire], that doesn’t say how you’ll do with black voters.”

Biden over his career has forged strong ties in South Carolina and especially with African Americans, who make up nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State. He frequently vacations on Kiawah Island, a spot in the lowcountry near Charleston where residents got a semiannual glimpse of the vice presidential motorcade.

AD

AD

Biden also has decades of relationships with South Carolinians. He counts Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) as a close friend. At Clyburn’s annual fish fry in June, a South Carolina mainstay for those who want to be president, Biden shook hands and took photos along a rope line until nearly midnight. He was the last presidential candidate to leave.

Maria Washington, 64, of Charleston, said she was a Biden fan well before then.

“I’m ride or die Biden,” she said as she ate a barbecue lunch Saturday at the Blue Jamboree. “I look at each of them and what they have done. . . . Biden has been on an even keel for 40 years.”

Washington’s friend, Hermine Hawkins, who like Washington is black, said her questions about whether Biden would be good for African Americans were answered when President Barack Obama selected him as a running mate.

AD

AD

“If Barack Obama pulled him on his team, there’s some validity there,” she said.

Still, critics have been particularly vocal in recent weeks, and Biden has faced threats to his presidential aspirations from multiple fronts.

On Wednesday, Biden called for Trump’s impeachment, using his strongest language yet, in an offensive that came as Trump has inundated Twitter with false claims about the Bidens and Ukraine. That same day, the president’s reelection campaign announced a $10 million ad buy targeting Biden and focused on early-voting states.

Meanwhile, Warren has gained strength, sometimes attracting large crowds to her events, something Biden has struggled to do.

AD

But those setbacks have not significantly dented Biden’s support. That’s in large measure because his closest rivals, Warren and Sanders, have had trouble winning the backing of black voters.

AD

For Biden’s Palmetto State supporters, the question is whether he can win there in a way that propels him for the contests that follow. The Feb. 29 South Carolina primary is followed on March 3 by Super Tuesday, featuring a diverse slate of 16 states that includes North Carolina, Alabama and California.

Williams, the state representative, predicted that Biden’s success in South Carolina “is going to send a message to the rest of the country.”

Three, Klobuchar, Sanders and Biden, named the late senator John McCain. Buttigieg said the people he met in the military from different walks of life. Warren said Charles Fried, a solicitor general in the Bush administration, who helped her get a job 27 years ago. She also mentioned her three older brothers whose politics are different from hers.

Harris said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Gabbard said former congressman Trey Gowdy, and O’Rourke recalled driving with Rep. Will Hurd from Texas to Washington and airing the whole thing on Facebook. Booker referenced working with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and his effort to dine with every Republican senator, including Ted Cruz (Tex.).

Gabbard also used the moment to take a veiled shot at Hillary Clinton, saying, “When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans.”

Yang cited a trucker named Fred, an avid supporter of President Trump who he said is now supporting him.

“He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs, and I’m happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we’ve remained in touch ever since,” Yang said.

Warren, Biden face off on CFPB

Biden, situated onstage between liberal champions Sanders and Warren, attempted to distinguish himself as the realist with a résumé of successes.

“I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here. But I'm the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,” Biden said. “The question is who is best prepared. We all have good ideas.”

Warren shot back that she came up with the idea to create a consumer agency to keep big banks in check and that she helped get it passed.

Biden responded that he played a key role in persuading people to support that bill. “I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “So let’s get those things straight too.”

Warren paused before responding, “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed in the law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it. And who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

“Understand this: It was a dream-big fight-hard,” Warren said. “People told me go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept … we have to be willing to make big structural change.”

Candidates address abortion rights

Harris said that if she were elected president, her Justice Department would use “pre-clearance” to fight back against state legislators that pass unconstitutional abortion restrictions, so that those laws would not go into effect. She also recalled questioning Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and asking whether he could think of a law that sought to control only men’s bodies.

“And the answer was ‘Uh, uh, uh, no,’” Harris said. “The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America.”

Several candidates, including Klobuchar and Castro, said they would codify Roe v. Wade. Booker said he would create an office of reproductive freedom in the White House to elevate the issue.

AD

Gabbard said the necessity of “safe, legal and rare” abortions was one of the rare things on which she agreed with Hillary Clinton. However, she said there should be restrictions in place so that abortions were not allowed in the third trimester “unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.”

AD

Warren said she lived through a time in the United States when abortion was illegal and reminded the crowd that people still got abortions — if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal. It was the poor and young who were denied access, she said.

Biden takes stronger stance on justices

Biden has previously taken heat from the Democratic base because he suggested that Republicans would be willing to work with him if he were elected president.

AD

“With Trump gone, you’re going to begin to see things change,” Biden said earlier this year. “Because these folks know better. They know this isn’t what they’re supposed to be doing.”

On the debate stage Tuesday night, he struck a different note, declaring that he would take the same approach to the Supreme Court as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did when he blocked the Senate from considering the nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016.

AD

At the time, McConnell had argued that the successor to the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia should be chosen by whichever president won the November 2016 election.

Biden said Tuesday night that, if one of the current Supreme Court justices steps down, he would make sure as the Democratic nominee that his party “would do exactly what McConnell did last time out: We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.”

Harris wants Warren to join her call to kick Trump off Twitter

In their first notable disagreement of the night, Harris pressed Warren to join her in calling for Trump to be kicked off Twitter, accusing Warren of having a double standard when it comes to holding corporations accountable.

“I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,” Warren responded.

AD

Warren then said the real problem is not whether Twitter will suspend Trump but the amount of corporate money in politics.

“You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,” Warren said.

AD

Harris pivoted back to the corporate accountability issue, arguing that Warren has different standards for different businesses.

“This is a matter of holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people’s perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors, we all have to agree this is their power,” Harris said. “And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.”

“I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don’t have a problem with that,” Warren said, though she didn’t clarify whether she would support Harris’s call to kick Trump off Twitter.

Biden has an answer on his age

Biden had an answer ready when the moderators eventually asked him about his age. He turned the question around, emphasizing the experience and wisdom he has gained through his decades of public service.

AD

“I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,” the 76-year-old former vice president said.

Warren, 70, also fielded a similar question. She emphasized her tenacity, arguing that she will work harder than any other candidate, regardless of age.

“Well, I say, I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said, a nod to the possibility that Trump may be removed from office before the 2020 election.

Sanders, asked about health, says he’s ‘feeling great’

As the debate approached the two-hour mark, Sanders faced a question about his health.

“I’m healthy. I’m feeling great,” he said when a moderator broached the subject, before he insisted on weighing in on a previous question about drug laws.

When Booker pointed out Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders quipped, “I'm not on it tonight.""

Then Sanders, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago, gave a more serious answer, telling Americans he would prove to them that he has the fitness to serve by “mounting a vigorous campaign,” including a comeback rally with a special guest in New York on Saturday.

Klobuchar makes opioid epidemic personal

Klobuchar made a question about the opioid epidemic personal by relating a story about her father, who struggled with an alcohol addiction, as a reason there should be more investment in treatment programs.

“My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI, they said to him, ‘you’re going to face jail or you got to go to treatment.’ He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace, and he has been sober ever since,” Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar has spoken about her father’s struggles before, most famously during the confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh.

The senator also mentioned drug executives’ emails revealed by The Washington Post, in which one said about pills: “Just like Doritos keep eating. We’ll make more.”

Debate turns to gun control

The candidates delivered impassioned arguments on gun control, with several — including Booker, Harris and Castro — referencing their personal experience with gun violence in their communities.

Harris said that there are 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America today and noted her experience meeting with the family of gun violence victims, including police officers shot in the line of duty, during her time in California.

“I’m done,” Harris said. “And we need action. And Congress has had years to act and failed because they have not had the courage.”

Klobuchar noted that polls show a majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks. “I just don’t want to screw this up,” she said.

Castro prompted applause from the crowd when he called for action on the case of Atatiana Jefferson, who was fatally shot in her home by a Fort Worth police officer.

“Police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that,” Castro said.

O’Rourke and Buttigieg also had a heated exchange on guns, after a moderator asked O’Rourke how he would enforce his proposed mandatory buyback of AR-15s and AK-47s.

O’Rourke said he would trust his fellow Americans to follow the law.

“You just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the street. If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait,” Buttigieg shot back. “We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.”

O’Rourke said those challenges were not mutually exclusive. He said he also supports a ban on the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines, and red-flag laws. He called for a comprehensive gun-control policy. “Let’s decide what we are going to believe and what we are going to achieve. And let’s bring this country together in order to do that,” O’Rourke said. ““Let’s … not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups.”

“The problem isn’t the polls. The problem is the policy,” Buttigieg said dryly. “And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

Biden calls on foreign policy experience

Playing up his decades of foreign policy experience, Biden said that he’s the only person on the stage who had “spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan,” referring to the leaders of Russia and Turkey.

Biden also blasted Trump for how he’s conducted global affairs.

“We have an erratic crazy president, who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says: ‘I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don’t believe our intelligence.’”

Booker also attacked Trump’s relationship with Putin, saying he had turned “the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire.”

“Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president, time and time again, is showing moral weakness. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron,” Booker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. “… I will stop this, and restore American integrity abroad.”

Asked about Trump’s decision, Castro launched a double-edged attack, criticizing the president’s policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking aim at his withdrawal of troops from Syria.

“Think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free,” Castro said.

Sanders isn’t toning it down

Sanders gave a fiery answer, a signal that he is not toning down his combative tendencies in the wake of his health scare.

“Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they engage in another mass slaughter,” he said forcefully in the second hour of the debate.

Earlier, he eagerly reminded viewers that when it comes to Medicare-for-all, he “wrote the damn bill.""

And he gave one of the most impassioned defenses yet of his health-care plan, challenging Democrats to have the “guts” to stand up to the insurance companies and fight for a system that offers universal care.

Two veterans onstage face off on involvement in Syria

Gabbard and Buttigieg, the only veterans onstage, faced off on the question of U.S. involvement in Syria and what to do about Turkey’s attack on the Kurds, waged days after Trump ordered U.S. troops out of Syria.

Gabbard called the situation “yet another negative consequence of the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.” But she placed blame beyond Trump to include politicians “from both parties” and the mainstream media.

“Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” Buttigieg told Gabbard. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

He said U.S. troops were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and the resurgence of the Islamic State.

“Really, what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is you would continue to support having troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time, to continue this regime-change war?” Gabbard asked.

Buttigieg said what the United States was doing in Syria was keeping its word.

“Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too,” he said. “I would have a hard time today looking at an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there, and it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.”

Buttigieg, Klobuchar call Warren’s plans unrealistic

For the second time this evening, Buttigieg and Klobuchar attacked Warren for promoting an unrealistic policy. Both went after her wealth-tax plan and tried to appeal to more-moderate voters.

“Washington politicians … [offer] the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes,” Buttigieg said, a comment directed at Warren.

Klobuchar chimed in with a more pointed attack, suggesting that Warren’s characterization of her competitors’ plans was unfair.

“I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea,” Klobuchar said.

O’Rourke joined in too, calling the Massachusetts Democrat’s wealth-tax plan “punitive.”

Warren quickly fired back. “I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive,” she said.

After the moderators tossed a question to Booker, the New Jersey Democrat took a moment to call on his competitors to tone down the intraparty attacks.

“You know, we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate really matters,” Booker said, drawing applause from the crowd.

Billionaires’ place in America is discussed

At one point, Sanders was asked whether his goal was to “tax billionaires out of existence.” The Vermont senator launched into a lengthy speech about income inequality in the United States, lamenting the staggering number of homeless, uninsured, underinsured and debt-burdened Americans.

“Then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is a moral and economic outrage,” Sanders said. “And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class.”

Steyer, the only billionaire on the debate stage, agreed that Sanders was right to go after the wealthy.

“There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful,” Steyer said. “As Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income, it’s absolutely wrong, it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.”

Steyer then advocated for a wealth tax, ending Trump’s tax cuts and increasing the minimum wage.

Warren takes on Yang on universal basic income

Warren found herself on defense for much of the first half-hour of the debate. But as the end of the first hour neared, she played offense against Yang, taking on the entrepreneur over his signature issue, universal basic income, which would guarantee every American $1,000 a month, no matter their employment status.

“I think the thing closest to universal basic income is Social Security,” Warren said, arguing that her proposal for strengthening Social Security would do more to protect vulnerable Americans than Yang’s plan.

She added that she wants to “see the data.”

“I have the data,” Yang quickly shot back.

Harris brings up abortion

During the back and forth on Medicare-for-all, Harris noted that women’s reproductive rights did not come up in any of the previous debates, even though, she said, Republican state legislatures are trying to dismantle those rights.

“This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women’s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,” she said. “It’s outrageous.”

Harris continued, “People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.”

Medicare-for-all: Who would pay?

In the first policy debate of the evening, Warren and Buttigieg sparred over whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare-for-all.

“I have made clear what my principles are here: Costs will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Warren said.

Buttigieg, who has previously accused Warren of being “evasive” on that question, said she was doing so again on the debate stage.

“A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Buttigieg charged, before touting his own plan, “Medicare for All Who Want It,” which institutes a public option but allows private insurance companies to remain.

Sanders cut in, noting that he was the person “who wrote the damn bill.”

If the proposal is passed, taxes are going to go up significantly — for the wealthiest Americans, Sanders said.

Warren faced more flak from another opponent: Klobuchar, who argued Warren was “making Republican talking points right now in this room.”

Klobuchar also prompted applause from the crowd — a rarity so far this evening — when she raised the issue of the opioid epidemic.

Sanders and Biden, who have long disagreed over health-care policy, engaged in one of their sharpest exchanges on the topic in any debate.

Biden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg’s thunder by saying that the mayor’s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded — expanding Obamacare.

Sanders snapped back, arguing that those who are defending the current system are advocating for a problematic approach in which many Americans are suffering. He said he gets “a little tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.”

Biden addresses questions on Ukraine

Biden said he did nothing wrong when he worked on Ukrainian policy as vice president while his son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on,” Biden said.

Biden then pivoted to talking about Trump’s corruption, saying a statement his son put out today “speaks for itself.”

Pressed to answer whether it was a mistake for his son to take the position, Biden dodged the question.

“I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,” Biden said. “We’ve always kept everything separate even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We never discussed it so there’d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say.”

It was unclear what judgment Biden was referring to, but he seemed to be talking about his son’s public statement where he said it was a mistake for him to take the job.

Yang wants to talk about economic problems

While many of the candidates spent their first few minutes talking about Trump and the impeachment inquiry, Yang took a different approach, encouraging Democrats to focus on the economic problems that paved the way for Trump’s win in 2016.

“When we talk about him, we are losing,” Yang said of Trump. He noted that the debate was unfolding in Ohio, a state Trump won. “Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?” he asked, before pointing out the manufacturing job losses that have occurred in the state.

“These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected,” Yang said.

Steyer makes debate-stage debut

In his first debate appearance, Steyer noted that he began his “Need to Impeach” campaign two years ago, long before the other Democrats onstage embraced the idea.

Even as he sought to distinguish himself from the others onstage, Steyer also praised them, saying that every Democratic candidate was “more decent and patriotic than the criminal in the White House.”

Buttigieg, meanwhile, cast himself as a uniter who can bring the country together after Trump has left the White House. “One way or another, this presidency is going to come to an end,” Buttigieg said, asking listeners what it’s going to feel like the first day the sun comes up after Trump is no longer president. “Really think about where we’ll be — vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.”

“I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country,” he added.

Candidates talk about impeachment support

In his first comments, Biden said Trump’s decision to stonewall every congressional investigation led him to support the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Biden drew a contrast between Trump and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. At that time, Biden said lawmakers needed to be mindful of the American people’s vote.

“He’s gone so far to say since this latest event … I will not cooperate,” Biden said. “They have no choice but to move.”

Biden, who has found himself at the center of the impeachment inquiry, said nothing more about the specifics of the House investigation or his role in it.

Harris echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn’t think the impeachment process would take very long.

“Because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it,” Harris said.

Striking a more cautious tone, Booker said he understood “the outrage that we all feel” but said it was important to conduct the impeachment process in an “honorable” way that did not further divide the country.

Both Klobuchar and Castro brushed off concerns that impeachment would be a “distraction,” saying U.S. lawmakers and voters were capable of doing two things at once.

“When [Trump] made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent,” Klobuchar said. “That’s illegal conduct; that’s what he was doing.”

Sanders goes after Trump and Republicans

Sanders, who has been off the campaign trail for two weeks after suffering a heart attack, also went after Trump and Senate Republicans. “Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” said Sanders, speaking about the topic of impeachment.

While his voice was a bit scratchy as he spoke, Sanders sounded much clearer than he did in the last debate, when he was noticeably hoarse. He is positioned toward the middle of the stage, to the left of Biden. Sanders stood patiently with his hands in front of him as Biden delivered his first remarks of the debate.

Debate starts with discussion of impeachment

The moderators wasted no time tackling the issue of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Warren got the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump’s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.

Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt president in history. He highlighted the White House’s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. “They have no choice but to move,” he said of House Democrats.

The debate

To qualify, candidates had to hit 2 percent in at least four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee and receive contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors. The debate is at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, in the Columbus suburbs."

Something along the lines of, “Don’t worry, I’m gay.”

The three present the Supreme Court with a blockbuster question at the start of its new term: Is it legal to fire someone for being gay or transgender?

AD

The cases will be argued Tuesday.

This is one of the most consequential issues of the term, with more than 70 friend-of-the-court briefs dividing states, religious orders and members of Congress. More than 200 of the nation’s largest employers are supporting the workers.

AD

To some, it might seem surprising that this is an unsettled question. Cultural acceptance of the LGBTQ community is at a high. Transgender actors were spotlighted at the recent Emmy Awards, and “Orange Is the New Black” star Laverne Cox hit the red carpet accompanied by Chase Strangio, a transgender American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.

The gay rights movement has won victory after victory at the Supreme Court, capped by the landmark 2015 decision that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

AD

But gay rights leaders say “married on Sunday, fired on Monday” is a possibility in more than half of the United States, where there is no specific protection for gay or transgender workers. The states that prohibit discrimination are not uniform — some protect only gender identity or transgender status, and some differentiate between public and private employment.

AD

The issue for the court is the reach of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, besides protecting against workplace discrimination because of race, also prohibits discrimination “because of sex.”

For 50 years, courts read that to mean only that women could not be treated worse than men, and vice versa, not that discrimination on the basis of sex included LGBTQ individuals. The Trump administration says that is what the Supreme Court should find as well.

AD

“The ordinary meaning of ‘sex’ is biologically male or female; it does not include sexual orientation,” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said in a brief to the court in the Bostock and Zarda cases, which have been combined.

Employers violate Title VII only by treating members of one sex “worse than similarly situated members of the other sex. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, standing alone, does not satisfy that standard,” he wrote.

AD

Francisco makes a similar argument about gender identity in Stephens’s case.

That puts the Trump administration at odds with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which decided in 2015 that gay and transgender individuals were federally protected.

AD

Treating a man who is attracted to men differently than a woman who is attracted to men is discrimination, the EEOC reasoned.

The commission also looked at a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said federal law protected against discrimination based on stereotypes; the court found for a woman who had not been promoted because her employers found her too aggressive, and her manner of dress not feminine enough.

Discrimination because of sexual orientation is the same thing, the EEOC said, because it relies on stereotypes about to whom men and women should be attracted.

AD

Some courts have come around to those arguments. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled for Zarda, and said its contrary past decisions on the issue were wrong.

AD

Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann wrote that “sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.” (Zarda died in 2014, and his case is being advanced by his sister and partner.)

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit came to a similar conclusion in Stephens’s case. The panel found it “analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee’s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee’s sex.”

But in Bostock’s case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit went the other way, ruling for Clayton County, a suburb south of Atlanta, that Title VII did not protect on the basis of sexual orientation.

AD

AD

Bostock ran a program for about a decade that recruited volunteers to serve as advocates for abused and neglected children. “We achieved great success, statewide recognition,” Bostock said in an interview.

“But everything changed when I joined a gay recreational softball league,” he said.

His job was recruiting volunteers, and he recruited from the league, too.

One Monday in June 2013, Bostock found himself denied access to his office. He was told he was being fired.

The county says Bostock was terminated after an audit of the program, not because he is gay. Bostock’s suit was dismissed at an early stage because the lower courts ruled that Title VII did not cover sexual orientation.

AD

There is little dispute about the facts in Stephens’s case.

Stephens wrote an emotional letter to co-workers that said she suffered from gender dysphoria — a mismatch between the sex assigned at birth and a person’s gender identity — and said that after years of therapy she had decided to transition. Before surgical procedures, doctors said she should live for a year as a woman.

AD

“At the end of my vacation on August 26, 2013, I will return to work as my true self . . . in appropriate business attire,” Stephens wrote.

The funeral home’s owner, Thomas Rost, said he thought about it, but decided Stephens had to go. “He was no longer going to represent himself as a man. He wanted to dress as a woman,” Rost said in a deposition in the case.

AD

In a brief to the court, Rost’s lawyers elaborated: “He weighed the impact of his decision on Stephens and Stephens’s wife. He also thought about his female employees and clients who would be sharing a single-sex restroom with Stephens. Finally, he considered the impact on his clients’ grieving process. In the end, Tom could not agree to Stephens’s plan to violate the dress code, so he offered Stephens a severance.”

Harris Funeral Homes is represented by the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which says Title VII was not violated. The funeral home would have fired “a female employee who insisted on dressing as a man while working with grieving families. . . . Because it does not disfavor one sex compared to the other, Harris does not discriminate based on sex,” the brief states.

AD

In previous rulings on gay rights, such as striking down a federal law that recognized only marriages between a man and a woman and state statutes that outlawed homosexual conduct, the Supreme Court relied on the Constitution.

These three cases concern the text of Title VII. No one argues that Congress in 1964 intended to protect LGBTQ individuals; homosexual conduct was illegal in the vast majority of the country. The solicitor general said that basic fact should decide the cases.

“In 1964, the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex,” Francisco wrote. Congress is free to make clear that Title VII includes sexual orientation and transgender status, Francisco said, but it has repeatedly turned down attempts to change the law to do so.

The plaintiffs and their lawyers say that the statute’s text, not what Congress intended, should hold. That is something of a switch — usually it is conservatives making such a textualist argument — and the lawyers point to an unlikely ally: the late justice Antonin Scalia.

AD

In a 1998 ruling in a case called Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Scalia wrote for the court that male-on-male sexual harassment was covered by Title VII even though it is not mentioned in the statute or envisioned by Congress.

“It is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,” Scalia wrote, adding that same-sex harassment need not be “the principal evil Congress was concerned with.”

“We’re the textualists here,” said Ria Tabacco Mar, an attorney for the ACLU, which is representing the Zarda estate. “We’re the ones pointing to the words of the statute.”

But besides Scalia, the court will be without former justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who had written the majority opinion in each of the gay rights movement’s victories at the court. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who did not rule on major gay rights issues as a lower-court judge, is thought to be more conservative than his former boss Kennedy.

During a discussion of the case at Georgetown University Law Center, Supreme Court practitioner Roman Martinez said interpreting the text of the issue has scrambled usual alignments in the lower courts, with a leading liberal judge saying the statute does not cover sexual orientation and a leading conservative judge going the other way on transgender status.

It is possible the Supreme Court would rule differently on the two issues, and some observers think a prohibition on transgender status discrimination is closer to the statute’s wording, “because of sex.”

Nicole Saharsky, another lawyer who frequently argues before the court, thought that was more of a theoretical possibility than a real one.

“The Supreme Court’s going to say that there’s not a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but there is on the basis of transgender status?” she asked. “That just doesn’t seem like something they would do.”"

In doing so, they set aside Barr’s comments about the FBI having “spied” on Trump, along with Durham’s past skepticism of the FBI’s methods.

It’s getting difficult for them to find solace in much of anything involving Barr.

AD

The Washington Post’s Devlin Barrett, Shane Harris and Matt Zapotosky reported Monday that Barr has been traveling overseas to seek help from top allies for Durham’s probe, visiting Britain and making multiple trips to Italy. The Trump administration has also made requests of Australia, whose officials played a key role in alerting U.S. officials to Russian interference. Signs indicate that the Aussies have proven a receptive audience.

AD

The new disclosures recall last week’s news that Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to launch two investigations that carried potential political benefits for him — including one involving the Russia probe’s origins. Barr’s Justice Department downgraded a whistleblower complaint about the matter to a point where it didn’t need to be disclosed to Congress, even though the whistleblower said Barr “appears to be involved."" A rough transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president also showed Trump invoking Barr as someone he would connect the president with to facilitate the investigations. The Justice Department denied Barr did anything as described.

The new revelations are somewhat different than the Ukraine situation, though. It’s one thing to lean on a country to launch its own probes; it’s not quite the same thing to seek its cooperation with an American investigation.

AD

But the news appears to fill out the picture of an attorney general who was suspicious of the Russia probe’s origins from long before he took office, has honed his talking points about them in a very Trumpian direction, and now appears to be spending significant time pressing top allies to give the administration what it wants.

AD

Just because he’s asking for it, of course, doesn’t mean those allies will give him damning evidence to support his and Trump’s suspicions. It’s entirely possible that this will be handled aboveboard, with Durham asserting himself as the staid and reasonable prosecutor he is reputed to be.

But Barr’s involvement portends all kind of uncertainty and lends itself to suspicion. The mere fact that he’s apparently taking such an interest in this — to the extent that he has made repeated overseas trips — suggests this is a topic of significant concern for him. It perhaps indicates that it’s not something he is pursuing just to mollify Trump and check a box for the president who appointed him.

AD

Of course, that shouldn’t really be a surprise, given that Barr has been barking up this tree since 2017. Long before many Republicans were questioning the origins of the Russia investigation, Barr told the New York Times that there was more reason to investigate “various ‘national security’ activities carried out during the election” than there was to investigate potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. (He said the same of the Clinton Foundation and a debunked conspiracy theory involving the Clintons and Uranium One.)

AD

Barr told The Post around the same time, “I don’t think all this stuff about throwing [Clinton] in jail or jumping to the conclusion that she should be prosecuted is appropriate.” Then he added: “But I do think that there are things that should be investigated that haven’t been investigated.”

He now appears to be facilitating one of those investigations — hard. The risk of such high-profile involvement from Barr is that top allies see him as applying pressure on behalf of Trump to get the answers Trump wants, rather than simply making sure they cooperate with the things Durham asks them to do. Barr is clearly not erring on the side of looking like he has completely outsourced this whole thing to Durham and is a passive player.

AD

Trump has frequently thrown his weight around on the world stage in efforts to get allies to do his bidding — most recently, we’ve found out, in the case of Ukraine — and it’s very difficult to separate this from that. The danger is that these countries that rely upon their alliance with the United States get the same message the whistleblower alleged Trump sent to Ukraine: They had better “play ball,” or else. If that message is coming from both Trump and Barr, that’s a lot of pressure.

None of it is a signal of an attorney general just checking a box and/or straining to avoid proving his detractors correct; it’s a signal of an attorney general who has taken the kind of keen interest in this subject that his public comments should have made plainly obvious.

PANORA, Iowa — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was in New York, finishing a speech to nearly 26,000 people. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was on TV, carrying on an unexpected feud with the Democrats' last nominee for president. And Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was getting a standing ovation from rural Democrats, an hour west of Des Moines, before sharing a story about a man she'd met in New Hampshire.

“He goes up to me, and he whispers: 'Don't say anything, but I voted for Donald Trump,' “ Klobuchar recalled. “So I go: 'Don't worry, I won't say anything.' And he goes: 'I'm not going to do it again!' “

Seventy put-upon rural Democrats laughed and burst into applause. “I don't want to overemphasize this,” Klobuchar said. “You know a lot of those Trump voters aren't going to change. But there are a segment of them, nearly 10 percent of them, who voted for Barack Obama, then voted for Donald Trump. There are a bunch of them in this state. There are a bunch of counties in this state that voted for Obama, then for Trump. We don't want to leave those counties behind.”

Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, “with more to come,” she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again.

“If you want to peak in this race,” she said after a stop in Waterloo, “you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].”

A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters. In interviews around the events, Klobuchar-curious voters tended to list her alongside South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.); and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) as the candidates who could have the longest reach, because they were not seen as too left-wing. Craig Hinderaker, a 71-year-old farmer who saw Klobuchar in Panora (population 1,069), said he'd committed to her months earlier after becoming convinced that she had centrist appeal and real campaign skills.

“Biden was my top choice, but he's been dropping,” Hinderaker said. “Just too many errors.”

Klobuchar, who began running TV and digital ads in Iowa only this month, had methodically introduced herself to the state as the electable, relatable neighbor who Republicans had already learned to love. On the campaign's official bingo cards, there are squares for “bio diesel plant” and “breakfast pizza,” as well as the more evasive “bridge that crosses over the river of our divide.” Her stump speeches and town hall answers are peppered with references to Republican colleagues — “Lindsey Graham, who took up my bill with John McCain,” or “James Lankford, a very conservative senator from Oklahoma” — who have helped her pass bills. Without mentioning Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), she describes the sort of Democrats she says wouldn't win in 2020.

“People don't really want the loudest voice in the room,” Klobuchar said in Mason City. “They want a tough voice in the room, which I think I showed I could do in the debate. They want someone that's going to tell them the truth — look them in the eye and tell them the truth — and not make promises that they can't keep. They want someone who understands that there's a difference between a plan and a pipe dream, and that not everything can be free.”

The message, and its candidate, are not at this point dominant in Iowa. Warren and Sanders continue to get the largest crowds in the 18-candidate field, followed by Buttigieg, and “Medicare-for-all” remains popular with likely caucusgoers. Klobuchar has not yet qualified for November's debate, hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC, either; candidates need to poll at 3 percent or higher in at least four DNC-approved polls or 5 percent in two polls of early states. She has hit that mark in one national poll.

But Democratic voters, unlike the president's supporters, worry about the ideas that might lose them votes and consume media that feeds that worry. Politically engaged Republicans have “Fox and Friends,” a morning show where the president can do no wrong; Democrats have “Morning Joe,” hosted by a former Republican congressman, with a rotation of anti-Trump and anti-left-wing panelists, and “Real Time with Bill Maher,” whose host frequently warns Democrats that they'll lose if they nominate a left-wing candidate. (Maher hosted Klobuchar last week.)

Kathy Bowman, 70, who saw Klobuchar speak in Davenport on Friday, quoted the New York Times columnist David Brooks to make a case for the senator from Minnesota. Brooks had just argued for anti-Trump conservatives to vote for any Democrat, while worrying that Warren would present a choice between “a bad option and a suicidal one.” Democrats, Brooks wrote, could still pick someone less offensive to Republicans and win big.

“I agree with that,” she said. “And I think that a more moderate voice, like Amy or Pete, would be stronger contenders for winning. And they would be more effective at governing.”

Klobuchar has embraced that theory of politics. The bigger the presidential candidate's appeal, the bigger the coattails; the bigger the coattails, the more likely that Democrats could “take back the Senate,” she says. At media gaggles between bus stops, she scoffed at only two questions — one asking her to weigh in on the argument between Gabbard and Hillary Clinton and another asking why she had won a second term by 35 points but a third term by only 24 points.

“That's a lot!” she said, laughing at the audacity of the question. “I always have won by huge margins. Mostly I think what's important is that I won 42 of the counties that Donald Trump won.”

Every Democrat argues that he or she can win back Trump voters; Klobuchar is the only candidate with receipts. While Sanders and Warren argue that they could change the electorate through organizing — Sanders, in particular, has focused on registering working-class nonvoters — Klobuchar says the people who voted in 2018 are ready for the right Democrat.

“I think that they are going be voting at record levels, like they did in the midterms,” she said. “Look at the midterms. Look at how we were able to win them. We won them with an increased turnout. We also won them with candidates who fit their districts. Sometimes they were liberals. Sometimes they were people like [Des Moines-area moderate Rep.] Cindy Axne.”

On the debate stage, and after, Klobuchar has cut through the electability argument by describing most left-wing candidates as unrealistic and a little dishonest. Warren's rise in the state came after she proposed a “wealth tax” that paid for almost every one of her agenda items, from universal child care to forgiveness of most student loan debt. Klobuchar, and plenty of other Democrats, have zeroed in on the item the wealth tax does not pay for — Medicare-for-all — to portray the senator from Massachusetts as slippery.

In doing so, Klobuchar is cashing in on a bet she made two years ago, when she refused to join many 2020 contenders (and even her then-fellow senator from Minnesota, Al Franken) and endorse Medicare-for-all. The campaign sees a strong contrast to be made with Pete Buttigieg, the other beneficiary of the debates, who had repeatedly endorsed the “Medicare-for-all” term and the end-goal of “single-payer” health care but now campaigns for “Medicare-for-all who want it.” Klobuchar points out that unlike him, she had to take an actual stand against activists pressuring her to sign on to the bill.

“When you're in the Senate, you can't pussyfoot around these issues,” Klobuchar said. “Our first call is to do no harm, but we also have to make things better. And what's the best way to do that? Well, it's the public option, and it's taking on pharma. So that's what I've talked about from the beginning. I have not wavered from that. There was a lot of pressure to put your name on that [Medicare-for-all] bill, and I'm the only one on that stage from within the Senate who is not on it.”

Asked whether the end goal of the public option should be single-payer — the eventual replacement of most private insurance with one government provider — Klobuchar was pragmatic. “Can people change their minds over time?” she asked. “You can always make adjustments.” It was a theoretical question, and she was more interested in what she could do with executive powers or with a Democratic Senate.

At each stop, with crowds ranging from 70 to 200 people, Klobuchar tended to get questions about what she liked to emphasize. What could she get done? Every question was an opportunity to get back to her record, which evoked a calmer, better Washington where no one got credit unless they did real work.

“As you look at all these candidates, a lot of them have made promises now that they're running for president,” Klobuchar said in Panora. ""Look at who is the candidate on that stage who chose to get on the Agriculture Committee, and is proud to serve on the Agriculture Committee. That would be me.”

When the speech was over, Klobuchar stayed for photos, as the campaign invited Panorans to visit her green-wrapped campaign bus. Some of the gawkers took photos. One guest left a rhubarb pie. After all, no other 2020 Democrat had been nice enough to visit Panora.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard speaks during last week's debate in Ohio. (John Minchillo/AP)

It started, like all great Democratic arguments, on a podcast. Talking freely with David Plouffe, the former Obama campaign manager who went on to work for Uber, Hillary Clinton groused about how 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein affected that election, calling her a “Russian asset.” She worried about history repeating itself.

“I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She's the favorite of the Russians.”

That was immediately taken as a reference to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who Clinton did not name but who quickly tweeted a condemnation of the 2016 nominee. That kicked off the most sustained national attention for Gabbard's campaign since a tough July debate performance in which she attacked Sen. Kamala D. Harris's criminal justice record. The California Democrat didn't have an effective response onstage, but afterward, spokesman Ian Sams suggested that reporters read an MSNBC story investigating how, as he quoted the article, “the Russian propaganda machine that tried to influence the 2016 election is now promoting the presidential aspirations of a controversial Hawaii Democrat.”

At the time, coverage treated that story as sour grapes. The Clinton attack on Gabbard was handled differently, with Gabbard heading immediately onto Fox News to decry the 2016 nominee and allege that Clinton was frustrated because “warmongers” such as Clinton could not ""control"" a 38-year-old veteran.

“They are basically sending this message out to every veteran in this country, every service member, every American, anyone watching at home who is fighting for peace and who is calling for an end to these regime change wars,” Gabbard said. “They are saying that you are also a Russian asset, that you are also a traitor to this country. That’s really what’s happening here.”

Why is Clinton's direct attack making a bigger splash than one from an active Democratic candidate? It's not complicated. Clinton made the attack herself, not through an intermediary. And Clinton looms large, even in quasi-retirement, for the voters and media consumers who have been most interested in Gabbard: those who think a permanent government of hawkish elites is threatened by anyone who criticizes it. Clinton is a foil for that, and Harris isn't.

“Unfortunately, due to the heavy influence of the foreign policy establishment in Washington that for decades has crossed both political parties, you see the lot of the same faces and a lot of the same people providing the same kinds of neocon or neo lib advice to Democrat and Republican leaders,” Gabbard told supporters Saturday in West Branch, Iowa. “And you see the influence of the military-industrial complex. You see how people like myself and others are treated when we speak out and call for an end to these counterproductive regime change wars like the one I served in in Iraq, like the one in Libya, like the one ongoing in Syria. You see how we are smeared, how we are called names.""

Gabbard had been talking like this for a while, even using a moment on the debate stage to say that the hosts, CNN and the New York Times, had run “despicable” attacks on her, saying it was probably because the mainstream media was “championing and cheerleading” “regime-change wars.” Clinton's intervention both unnerved and thrilled Democrats.

Those who liked it had worried for a while about Gabbard, for the reasons first reported by MSNBC. Like Ron Paul, a 2008 and 2012 Republican presidential candidate who was never accused of being in league with Russia, Gabbard has been a superstar of Russian media such as the English-language network RT. Strategists at some other campaigns had been worried not about a Gabbard surge — she had been mired in the low single digits and has a small, ad hoc Iowa organization — but by Gabbard being egged on to attack the party through alternative media.

Whether she runs as a third-party candidate (something she ruled out again Saturday) or as a protest candidate who would take her campaign to the convention, Gabbard's critics worried that she could use media appearances to discourage liberal turnout. And that was what left Democrats unnerved.

Which party would you like to see controlling Virginia's legislature? (Wason Center, 726 registered voters)

Democrats — 53%

Republicans — 37%

Virginia will elect a new legislature in just 16 days, and Democrats have an advantage, if not as decisive as the one they had two years ago. In November 2017, Virginia's elections became the vector for national liberal anger at the president, with surrogates and money flowing in to the commonwealth. (Not “state.” They'll know you're not from there if you say “state.”) There has been less national intervention this year, but polling has increasingly found Gov. Ralph Northam recovering from the blackface revelation that nearly ended his career and Republicans being dragged down by the president's unpopularity. A majority of Virginians believe they're headed in the right direction, and if Republicans lose two seats in the state House and one in the state Senate, they lose control completely.

2022 Maryland Senate race (Washington Post-University of Maryland, 819 registered voters)

Larry Hogan (R) — 50%

Chris Van Hollen (D) — 42%

The most popular governors in the country are Republicans in charge of deep blue states, with Hogan and Massachusetts's Charlie Baker at the head of the line. But no popular Republican governor of a blue state has been able to pull off a Senate win in decades; no Democratic governor of a red state has done it since 2000, when Nebraska's Ben Nelson won the first of two terms. (Nelson had previously lost a Senate bid.) But Hogan and Baker have both led speculative polls about how they'd fare as Senate candidates; Baker led Sen. Ed Markey in a 2020 contest and Hogan leads Van Hollen here. There may be pressure for a term-limited Hogan to consider running in 2022, when he'll be just 65 years old, but the list of governors who tried this red-blue tango recently — Tennessee's Phil Bredesen, Massachusetts's Bill Weld — is foreboding.

Sen. Bernie Sanders appears at a 'Bernie's Back' rally in Queens on Saturday. (Gary He/EPE-EFE)

Bernie Sanders. He held the biggest campaign rally of the 2020 cycle so far, drawing nearly 26,000 people to the waterfront in Queens for a lengthy event with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other new endorsers, including filmmaker Michael Moore. His surrogates tackled different themes, from alleged ageism in coverage of Sanders to how he'd pulled them, personally, into politics.

“I want you all to take a look around and find someone you don't know,” said Sanders, a tack he has not taken in stump speeches. “My question now to you is are you willing to fight for that person who you don't even know as much as you're willing to fight for yourself?”

Elizabeth Warren. After weeks of pressure over her refusal to say whether “middle-class taxes” would be increased by Medicare-for-all, Warren said in Iowa that she would release “a plan that talks specifically about the costs of Medicare-for-all and specifically how we pay for it,” telling reporters afterward that she’d been “working on the details for a long time.”

Joe Biden. He held two New York fundraisers while Sanders rallied nearby, taking a swipe at the president's attempt to hold the G-7 meeting in “his failing country club so he can make money.” A few hours later, President Trump abandoned that plan.

Andrew Yang. He's being interviewed at The Washington Post on Monday and finally getting his New Hampshire “Politics and Eggs” breakfast this week, on Wednesday, as part of a three-day swing through the state.

Justin Amash. Now the only independent in the House, he again declined to rule out a run for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination in an interview with “Meet the Press” on NBC. “I'm running for Congress, but I keep things open and I wouldn't rule anything out,” he said.

John Delaney. He kicked off his “heartland start-up” tour over the weekend, en route to the latest Democratic dinner in Cedar Rapids, which will also be attended by Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Tulsi Gabbard.

Pete Buttigieg. He said on “Meet the Press” that he wanted to draw down America’s presence in Afghanistan but leave some options: “What was withdrawn from Syria is exactly the sort of thing that if we had it in Afghanistan, would prevent endless war of the scale that we're seeing now.”

In the Democratic presidential primary, candidates have appeared at forums devoted to women of color, women’s reproductive health, Native Americans and LGBTQ people. On Thursday night, CNN will broadcast a town hall on LGBTQ issues, in what its primary organizer, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, says is the first such event.

Over the course of a 4½-hour broadcast, nine candidates will face questions from some of CNN’s highest-profile journalists, including Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, who will press the candidates on LGBTQ issues.

“Largely, we do have agreement among the field about the top line for what the priorities are for LGBTQ people,” HRC spokesman Lucas Acosta said. “But what we want to hear, and what the town hall will afford us to have the opportunity to hear, is: ‘What are your plans to address those things? How are you going to do that?’ So we can hear, as LGBTQ people, who has the most well thought out and most able to be done plan.”

AD

AD

The forum comes the same week the Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments in three cases that will decide whether gay and transgender people are protected by federal anti-discrimination laws. The issue will probably feature in the town hall, Acosta said, along with other specific policy subjects such as adoption, health issues such as HIV and AIDS, and combating violence against the LGBTQ community, and, in particular, trans women of color.

HRC held candidate forums in 2004 and 2008 but never had the exposure of a prime-time cable news broadcast, according to Acosta. “We’re going to be having the biggest audience we ever had in our history,” he said.

While other events have not had the scale of HRC and CNN’s LGBTQ town hall, they have helped push the 2020 Democratic candidates to bring specific policy proposals to the table for communities that are typically taken for granted, if not outright neglected, by the political establishment, the groups said.

“Indian country has been locked out of presidential campaigns and elections since the beginning of time,” OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of Native American voting rights organization Four Directions, told The Washington Post. This year, he wanted things to be different.

Four Directions was a lead organizer of an August forum devoted specifically to Native American issues. The unconventional format, which featured candidates speaking alongside tribal elders and members in Sioux City, Iowa, was intended to not only allow Native American voters to get to know the candidates but also to introduce the politicians to leaders and voters in the community.

Initially, Semans told The Post that the campaigns were slow to respond, but after the event began to pick up media coverage, he started getting more confirmations, including from Marianne Williamson, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

AD

Warren notably used the forum to apologize for taking a much-criticized DNA test last year to prove she had Native American ancestry.

“I am sorry for harm I have caused,” Warren told the audience. “I have listened, and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations that we’ve had together.”

Semans told The Post he had not expected such a response from Warren, and appreciated her remarks. He believed the 2020 Democratic candidates were taking Native American issues far more seriously than in any other contest he can remember, and praised candidates such as Warren and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro for releasing multipronged policy proposals.

AD

“We have started a discussion that hasn’t happened in hundreds of years, in which we were at the table talking about major issues that can really up the social and economic conditions on reservations,” Semans said. He hoped to hold another forum in January, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.

AD

Just as these forums present opportunities for Democratic candidates to demonstrate the scope of their commitment and win over skeptical voters, they also present new ways for politicians to stumble.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, an openly gay presidential candidate, faced questions from some Democrats after he initially declined to attend an Iowa LGBTQ forum in September because of schedule conflicts, BuzzFeed reported. He later reversed the decision and attended.

AD

“When politicians skip out and people skip out, they’re going to feel that,” said Lyz Lenz, a columnist at the Cedar Rapids Gazette who co-moderated that forum. “Especially in a race where there are so many of them, every little voting bloc matters.”

At that same event, former vice president Joe Biden stumbled when he called his female moderator Lenz “a lovely person” after receiving a tough question from her about voting for the Defense of Marriage Act, reinforcing critiques that the septuagenarian candidate is out of touch with today’s social trends. As Lenz pointed out, Biden has evolved on the issue and now supports same-sex marriage, but a video of his tense response became the headline from the event.

“To speak to the base of voters requires a language, it requires a cultural competency, an attention to the detail of policies,” said Aimee Allison, who organized April’s She the People presidential forum devoted to policy issues facing women of color. She believed that “none of these candidates are going to be able to win the primary without winning over and building” support among diverse groups.

“If you want to represent the American population,” Allison said, “you have to get the skills or get out of the way.”

But with Wednesday’s plea agreement, Hayes admitted to lying to federal agents in August when he said he had never talked with the insurance commissioner about “personnel or personnel problems” or about his co-defendants Lindberg, founder and chairman of the firm Eli Global, and John Gray, a consultant.

“Today was a big step forward,” Hayes’s attorney Kearns Davis said in a statement Wednesday. “Robin looks forward to completing this process and moving ahead.”

Hayes still faces up to six months in prison, but the plea deal could mean that he emerges from the bribery scandal with no jail time, former FBI official and Charlotte lawyer Chris Swecker told the Charlotte Observer. Plea documents say the government intends to “recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range.”

“It’s a real astute, savvy move on [Hayes’s] part,” Swecker said, according to the Observer.

The March indictment, which also names Eli Global executive John Palermo, describes a May 2018 phone call with Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey in which Hayes allegedly mentions millions of dollars pledged by Lindberg and Gray, along with their desired staffing change.

“There were some personnel issues,” Hayes told Causey, according to court documents, going on to reference a woman whom “they would like to see put back into that department to make sure that things got done that needed to get done.”

Lindberg, Gray and Palermo still face bribery and conspiracy charges, according to the Justice Department. Their trial was set to begin Nov. 18, but attorneys for Gray and Palermo have sought a delay until February to provide more prep time for what the lawyers called an “unusual and complex” case, according to the Observer. The case reportedly involves more than 2 million pages of documents.

Hayes is a one-time gubernatorial candidate who represented North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District for a decade through 2009. He chaired the state GOP from 2011 to 2013 and from 2016 to this year. His bribery indictment in spring came on the heels of another scandal for Republicans in the state: Less than two months earlier, North Carolina officials had ordered a redo of a congressional race after evidence of ballot-tampering tainted GOP candidate Mark Harris’s victory.

“It’s become clear to me that the public’s confidence in the 9th District-seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted,” Harris acknowledged at the time.

Hayes weighed in as GOP chairman to say that the state party backed Harris’s decision to support a redo.

Republicans narrowly retained the seat in a special election last month, as new candidate Dan Bishop pulled about two percentage points ahead of his Democratic rival in a district that President Trump had won by 12 points in 2016.

AD

The word “transgender” made its first appearance in a Supreme Court argument, as did “cisgender” — the term for a person whose gender identity matches how they were identified at birth — and the gender-ambiguous character “Pat” from “Saturday Night Live” skits that aired during the 1990s. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose questions in court gave no signal about his views on the case, was careful with pronouns, at one point using the neutral “they” to refer to an individual.

Lawyers for the gay and transgender individuals challenging their firings seemed to pitch their arguments to Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative who advocates a close textual reading of statutes. During the sexual orientation arguments, he pushed lawyers for the government and the employers to acknowledge that sex seemed to be at least a “contributing cause” to the terminations.

But during arguments in the transgender case, he wondered if “when a case is really close,” courts should make decisions that might cause “massive social upheaval” rather than leave it up to Congress.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the court’s newest member, kept a low profile during the two hours of argument, asking only one question.

There seemed little doubt that the court’s four liberal members would find that Title VII covered gay and transgender workers. But one of the court’s five conservatives would have to join them to form a majority.

The court combined two cases to consider whether gay workers are protected under the law. Gerald Bostock claims he was fired from his job as a social worker in Clayton County, Ga., after he became more open about being gay, including joining a gay softball league. Donald Zarda said he was fired as a skydiving instructor after joking with a female client to whom he was strapped for a tandem dive that he was gay. (Zarda died in 2014.)

AD

Stanford University law professor Pamela S. Karlan, representing the two gay employees, said the court need not update the 1964 law to find that sex plays a role when someone is fired because of sexual orientation.

AD

She gave an example of two employees who told their boss they had married “Bill” over the weekend.

“When you fire the male employee who married Bill and you give the female employee who married Bill a couple of days off so she can celebrate the joyous event, that’s discrimination because of sex,” Karlan said.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at times seem to throw objections at Karlan so she could bat them down.

“Ms. Karlan, how do you answer the argument that back in 1964, this could not have been in Congress’s mind because in many states male same-sex relations was a criminal offense; the American Psychiatric Association labeled homosexuality a mental illness,” Ginsburg said.

AD

“Well, I think you read the words of the statute,” Karlan replied. “And this court has recognized again and again forms of sex discrimination that were not in Congress’s contemplation in 1964,” mentioning sexual harassment and stereotypes.

AD

The questioning from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was not so benign. He said the plaintiffs wanted the court to do what Congress would not.

“Congress has been asked repeatedly in the years since 1964 to address this question. The Equality Act is before Congress right now,” Alito said. “Congress has declined or failed to act on these requests. And if the court takes this up and interprets this 1964 statute to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, we will be acting exactly like a legislature.”

AD

Jeffrey M. Harris, the lawyer for the employers, and Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, made precisely that argument. Sex and sexual orientation, Harris said, are independent and distinct characteristics.

“That is just as true today as it was in 1964” when Congress passed the law, which he said did not include protections for gay people.

AD

Added Francisco: “Sex means whether you’re male or female, not whether you’re gay or straight. So if you treat all gay men and women exactly the same because of their sex, you’re not discriminating against them because of their sex.”

Justice Elena Kagan said Francisco had the test wrong and discounted his view that Congress did not mean to cover sexual orientation.

AD

“For many years, the lodestar of this court’s statutory interpretation has been the text of a statute, not the legislative history, and certainly not the subsequent legislative history,” she said. “And the text of the statute appears to be pretty firmly in Ms. Karlan’s corner. Did you discriminate against somebody, against her client, because of sex?”

Roberts asked the workers’ attorney what new protections would mean for religious organizations. Karlan responded that exemptions already exist for those with religious objections to hiring gay workers.

AD

The questions about single-sex bathrooms and gender-specific dress codes came up mostly in the case involving Aimee Stephens, who worked for years at a Michigan funeral home before being fired after informing the owners and colleagues of her gender transition.

AD

American Civil Liberties Union legal director David D. Cole, representing Stephens, said the court will still face difficult questions about restrooms and athletic teams no matter how it rules in these cases.

But he said Stephens’s firing fit squarely within the law’s wording “because of sex.” She was fired, he said, “because she had a male sex assigned at birth.”

Gorsuch questioned whether siding with Stephens could mean “something as drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender-neutral would be changed.”

AD

Cole said federal courts have recognized discrimination against transgender people as a form of sex discrimination for 20 years.

AD

“There are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men’s room,” he noted. “The court’s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen.”

John J. Bursch of the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing the funeral home, made arguments similar to those in the other case: “Treating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women. That is because sex and transgender status are independent concepts.”

He portrayed Cole’s arguments as far-reaching. It would mean, he said, “that a women’s overnight shelter must hire a man who identifies as a woman to serve as a counselor to women who have been raped, trafficked, and abused and also share restroom, shower, and locker room facilities with them. That is because, but for the man’s sex, he would be allowed to hold that job and to use those facilities.”

AD

Ginsburg said there is a difference between treating men and women differently, and discrimination.

“Most people are not injured by having separate bathrooms,” she said. “In fact, most people would prefer it.”

The Trump administration’s position puts it at odds with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which decided in 2015 that gay and transgender individuals were federally protected.

Treating a man who is attracted to men differently from a woman who is attracted to men is discrimination, the EEOC reasoned.

The commission also looked at a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said federal law protected against discrimination based on stereotypes; the court found for a woman who had not been promoted because her employers found her too aggressive and her manner of dress not feminine enough.

That is analogous to discriminating against a transgender individual, the commission said. And discrimination because of sexual orientation is the same thing, the EEOC said, because it relies on stereotypes about to whom men and women should be attracted.

Gay rights leaders say “married on Sunday, fired on Monday” is a possibility in more than half of the United States, where there is no specific protection for gay or transgender workers. The states that prohibit discrimination are not uniform — some protect only gender identity or transgender status, and some differentiate between public and private employment."
