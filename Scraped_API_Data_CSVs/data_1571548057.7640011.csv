Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert.

The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers.

Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said.

He's been urged along by his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.

A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on.""

Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call, Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York.

Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.

The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons.

The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.

Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself.

""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""

Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy.

That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.

Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.

The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors.

Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States.

People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks.

""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen.""

At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed. The money was released last week

It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky.

But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government.

Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed.

""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."

Biden said no more about the issue as he and his staff loaded into a van to depart the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after hosting a town hall on Friday afternoon.

His remarks came as a communication between Trump and a foreign leader prompted a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute between the director of national intelligence and Congress. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night, prompting speculation that it could be tied to reports that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Hunter Biden during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation said Friday.

Cuomo followed up, “You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden –?”

Cuomo then interjected, “So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?”

Giuliani responded, “Of course I did.”

Cuomo then stated, “You just said you didn’t.”

Giuliani countered, “No, I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which, tangentially, involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme, not unlike what he did in China.”

Shortly after Bluhm’s comments broke on social media, the Sanders campaign responded by rebuking the billionaire donor and, in effect, Biden as well.

“Mr. Bluhm is right — the Democratic Party I represent is the party of the working class, not billionaires. That’s why we’re going to win,” the Sanders campaign said in a statement.

Bluhm’s criticism and the response it triggered underscores the internal divisions plaguing the Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Biden, despite having one of the most left-wing platforms of any Democrat frontrunner, is considered a moderate in comparison to the rest of the field. The image stems from the triangulation Biden has done over the span of his more than 40-year political career, especially on issues important to progressives like race, financial deregulation, and criminal justice.

The former vice president has also done little to appease the increasingly powerful left-wing of his party by aligning himself with the establishment in opposition to radical proposals like Medicare for All. Even Biden’s attempts to find common ground with progressives on climate change — by calling for an outright ban on coal — has been met with derision for not going far enough.

Sanders and Warren, on the other hand, are seen as progressive firebrands pushing the Democratic Party away from the Neoliberal policies of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and towards the more centralized economies of Northern Europe. Along those lines, Warren and Sanders have championed a series of policies — ranging from free higher education, increased Wall Street regulation, and higher taxes on the wealthy, among others — to remake the American economy.

The divergence between the former vice president and Sanders and Warren has been no clearer than on the issue of Medicare for All. Biden has consistently attacked the universal healthcare plan, which is authored by Sanders, as overly ambitious and impossible to implement. The former vice president, who is trumpeting his own healthcare proposal centered on strengthening Obamacare and providing a public health insurance option, has also lambasted the proposal’s backers for not being upfront about its costs and consequences.

“Bernie’s been very honest about it. He said you’re going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He said it’s going to end all private insurance. I mean, he’s been straightforward about it. And he’s making his case,” Biden told CNN in July, adding other Democrats have not been as transparent.

Sanders, Warren, and their allies have responded to such criticisms by accusing Biden of parroting Republican talking points on Medicare for All.

“The charge that he’s making is exactly what the Republicans are saying,” Sanders told the New York Times in July while excoriating Biden for siding with “insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries” on the issue.

Many, however, have noted that the battle for Medicare for All is really just a proxy battle between the establishment, which is averse to change, and the grassroots. Biden, himself, seemed to hint at this when he promised at a June fundraiser that “nothing would fundamentally change” if he was elected president."

As with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here's what we know:

Giuliani's accusation

Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton.

""In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,"" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. ""That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months.""

From there the interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden.

""Of course I did!"" he said.

But the President's attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials.

Trump spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump.

Asked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President, Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . ""It doesn't matter what I discuss,"" he said. ""But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case."" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president ""about eight times"" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter.

Vice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani's efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result.

REPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President? And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family?

VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, on the first question, the answer is no. But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America's support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail.

Ukraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia.

Biden's efforts in Ukraine

Despite Giuliani's allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden. The New York Times wrote about Biden's son and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump's allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly.

Asked about Trump's statement Friday, Biden said ""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion.""

""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,"" Biden said.

I sure wish Sen Richard Burr was as interested in Biden's cushy deals w/ Ukraine & China while VP than he is in the harassment of @DonaldJTrumpJr over a CLOSED witch hunt. #Enough — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) May 9, 2019

The crux of Giuliani's allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board.

But the reality is much more nuanced.

It is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He's actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously.

""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours,"" Biden said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

None of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there's no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing.

At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It's also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.

In an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden ""millions,"" but added, ""from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn't violate any Ukrainian laws.""

He said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators.

Lutsenko in May said he was looking to ""reanimate"" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden's former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office.

Giuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President's call with Trump in July.

According to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid.

Murphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter.

""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.

I don't know what is in the whistleblower complaint, but it was clear to me that Ukraine officials were worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani's demands. And of course they were. That's why presidents shouldn't have their campaigns talking to foreign leaders. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019

Trump's playbook

Fostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her ""crooked"" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House.

Biden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity.

The specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump's new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job.

Father and son

Hunter Biden's personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president.

The overlap between the father and son's political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics.

GOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden's career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father's, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo."

That call, which took place on July 25, one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added, a revelation that is likely to raise more questions in the ongoing controversy.

The Journal also reported that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said, according to the Journal.

Trump did not discuss a pending aid package to the country in the July 25 call, indicating that there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined by the President in the conversation, the source familiar with the issue told CNN.

A readout of the call put out by the Ukrainian government says, ""Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.""

Joe Biden responded to the new revelations in a strongly-worded statement Friday.

""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,"" Biden said.

""Such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,"" he added.

Trump downplays whistleblower's claims

Before the Journal's report was published, Trump downplayed the significance of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the latest controversy consuming Washington. During remarks in the Oval Office Friday, Trump claimed the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders are ""appropriate.""

But in a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump did not deny discussing Biden with Zelensky in that July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint.

""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said prior to the Journal's report being published while appearing alongside the Australian Prime Minister, who he was hosting for a state visit.

Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information.

""To ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election - right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election - would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times,"" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Friday in reaction to the news.

Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint.

But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, with whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

Trump still pushing Biden claim

Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden.

""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president.

Appearing in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening , Giuliani admitted he had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country.

Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter.

Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate.

Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President has come under scrutiny from House investigators and they have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter, including calls for a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president.

Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint.

""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."

Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert.

The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers.

Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said.

He's been urged along by his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.

A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on.""

Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call, Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York.

Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.

The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons.

The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.

Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself.

""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""

Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy.

That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.

Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.

The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors.

Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States.

People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks.

""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen.""

At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed. The money was released last week

It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky.

But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government.

Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed.

""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."

(CNN) I've been hearing a new conversation in coffee shops and happy hours around the country. One friend makes their prediction of who will win in November 2020, and the other nods in agreement. But then the voices become hushed as the second person asks, ""But do you really think the other side will accept the results?""

We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.

So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines -- believe that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?

Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.

We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.

Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.

And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?

Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination is tightening between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.

The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters would prefer to vote for Elizabeth Warren. They think she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter enthusiasm by double digits.

But nearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.

If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.

All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.

As David Leonhardt noted in the New York Times this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points , for instance.

Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows. Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse.

We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.

""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,"" she wrote in a tweet Friday evening . ""By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.""

(CNN) Ukraine has again returned to center stage in a critical international pirouette involving Russia and the United States for the first time since Moscow annexed Crimea five years ago. With media reports suggesting that President Trump pressured Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son during a phone call in July, a host of complex diplomatic and political forces have converged again in this corner of eastern Europe.

Zelensky, a former comedian, secured a landslide election victory in April . With no previous experience as a politician, he has to confront Russia's occupation of Crimea, as well as the ongoing conflict in the eastern region of Donbas with Russia-backed separatists.

This may be a unique moment in the modern history of Ukraine. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who are driven by their own respective political agendas, have suddenly inserted themselves in the midst of what could become an international imbroglio with Ukraine.

But Putin, Trump and Zelensky have converging interests, and all three could potentially come out as winners in a scenario that leads to the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, lifted sanctions on Russia, and the reelection of Trump.

Now, Ukraine appears to have become at least as critically important to Donald Trump, for a whole different set of reasons. It is here, Trump seems to believe, that he can pin charges of corruption on the son of Vice President Joe Biden , a Democratic candidate he clearly fears. And suddenly, both he and Putin appear now to have a Ukrainian president in power who is at the very least open for dialogue.

At first, Zelensky supported Ukraine's eventual membership in the European Union and NATO —both moves utterly anathema to Putin. Then the new Ukrainian leader proposed ending the war with Russian-backed forces in the Donbas by negotiating with Putin, and struck a hostage exchange with the Russian president that was lauded by President Trump as a ""first giant step to peace.""

The allegation against the Bidens has been debunked by respected fact-checking teams at news organizations including CNN. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to replace its top prosecutor, who was unpopular among many Western leaders due to concerns regarding corruption. It's also unclear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.

Despite this, it appears Trump and Giuliani believe Zelensky should look into the matter. In May, Giuliani abruptly canceled his trip to Ukraine a day after he announced his intentions to meet with Zelensky in Kiev. Instead, he traveled to Spain in August, and met with Andriy Yermak , a lawyer who serves as the president's aide.

According to Politico , the State Department said that the meeting had been facilitated by Kurt Volker , who has served abroad under four American presidents and is currently executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership and US Special Representative for Ukraine. I have known Volker as an individual of the utmost probity, and he, like the most seasoned American diplomats, clearly understands the need for all sides to feel as though they are coming out as winners.

Which may be where the interest of all three key players converge. Consider this scenario. Putin would no doubt very much like to see a second term for Trump. Already, the American president is pressing fellow members of the G7 to welcome Putin back into the club next year, and floating the idea that he will host the summit at his Miami golf resort

If Trump wins the 2020 election, he'll be freed from any need to win the support of voters. Trump would also presumably be free to move toward lifting sanctions against Russia, no matter how strenuously Congress -- and the rest of the western alliance -- might protest.

Zelensky, for his part, could do a big favor for Putin by digging into whatever Giuliani might want to help his client's presidential re-election effort. Putin, in turn, might even reciprocate by easing up on military actions in Donbas (though it is unlikely ever to return Crimea to Ukraine).

In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump suggested he was not acting in his own personal interest by saying ""I always look for the conversation that's going to help the United States the most."" In the same discussion, he also described the whistleblower, who filed an official complaint, as having a ""partisan"" agenda

The US released a $250 million military aid package days after three House committees announced a wide-ranging probe that would, among other things, look into whether such packages were being held hostage for the president's own political benefit. It is not unreasonable to expect that any future transactions would be smoothed by congenial relations between Zelensky and Trump, or even Putin.

The key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away? And how might this play out the next time Zelensky faces re-election, after winning a landslide victory on an anti-corruption campaign?

In interviews with the Albuquerque Journal, a handful of Hispanic voters said they backed Trump’s immigration agenda of ending illegal immigration, building a wall, and reducing legal immigration to raise U.S. wages.

“I believe in the wall,” Marcella Trujillo Melendez, a Trump supporter, told the Albuquerque Journal. “I believe in security. This is my country, and I want it to be safe.”

“The most important thing to me is that I believe he truly loves America,” Melendez continued. “I believe that he knows his job. His job is to put America first. He’s not the president of the world.”

Poll after poll has found that though Hispanic Americans continue to vote by a majority for Democrats, especially those who were born outside the U.S., they side with Trump on the key issue of immigration — that is, they want less immigration, not more, and do not believe American taxpayers should be subsidizing illegal immigration.

For example, the latest Harvard/Harris Poll found that Hispanic Americans, along with black Americans, are vastly opposed to plans put forward by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden to increase overall immigration to the U.S.

When ranked, Hispanic Americans listed increasing immigration as their second most unpopular issue, which would make them less likely to vote for a presidential candidate.

On the most extreme open borders plans endorsed by many elected Democrats, such as giving illegal aliens the right to vote, Hispanic Americans opposed the initiative by a majority of 73 percent.

Even with mainstream Democrat policies like providing taxpayer-funded welfare benefits to illegal aliens, temporary foreign visa workers, and legal immigrants who have yet to obtain green cards, Hispanic Americans align themselves with Trump.

A majority of 56 percent of Hispanic Americans said they support denying green cards to legal immigrants who are found to be a burden on taxpayers because of their use of welfare. Another 65 percent of Hispanic Americans said illegal aliens should not be allowed to take welfare.

With his agenda of less immigration and increased border controls, Trump won more Hispanic Americans in the 2016 election than failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did in 2012. For the first time in U.S. history, due to immigration, Hispanic Americans are set to outpace black Americans as the largest voting minority in the 2020 presidential election.

This time the particulars involve a whistleblower's complaint about a possible security breach at the highest level and the suggestion of a cover-up. Perhaps the only thing clear in this case is that once again President Donald Trump is calling the discordant tune.

True to form the President and his confederates are only adding to the chaos. In response to questioning from CNN's Chis Cuomo Thursday night, for example, Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog, Rudolph Giuliani, both denied and confirmed that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is leading the pack of Democrats hoping to oppose Trump in 2020. Could it be that the President's lawyer is mixing politics and policy in an unsavory way?

As usual it's hard to follow the action, but what is known thus far should worry us all. According to various news outlets, the White House and Justice Department told the inspector general for intelligence matters there was nothing to the whistleblower's report that a high level official, most likely the President, communicated in some untoward way with a foreign leader.

Under apparent pressure from the White House and Justice, the acting director of national intelligence blocked the intelligence IG from notifying Congress of the complaint, sidestepping a law requiring this. Now Capitol Hill leaders and the administration are battling over just who has a right to see the complaint.

In a normal, pre-Trump Washington, the issue of such a complaint would have been handled in a routine, if not collegial, way. But in this era, when the White House stonewalls as a matter of course, such a conflict seems inevitable—and, too, that the President would act in a way so heedless that some intelligence professional would sound an alarm

JUST WATCHED Cooper breaks down whistleblower complaint revelations Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cooper breaks down whistleblower complaint revelations 04:26

But this new crisis is completely in character for Trump, who has always operated as if personal relationships, and his self-interest, are all that really matter in every context. In every organization he has ever led, from his businesses in New York to the US government he has insisted on being the sole authority and expert, a man who ignored the rules as a matter of routine.

During his decades as a real estate developer and entertainer, Trump's style meant that he controlled all of the many hundreds of entities under his organization's umbrella, and those who worked below him were charged with making sure his decisions -- whether good or bad -- turn out for the best, while he claimed credit for successes and dodged accountability for failures.

Then, and apparently now, Trump relied on his instinct, which often got him into big trouble. Multiple bankruptcies proved that Trump's decision-making gut is a less-than-perfect instrument. Upon examining his failures, Susan Craig, of The New York Times, declared, ""We found most of it was just bad business.""

As President, Trump has depended on unconventional operatives like Giuliani to help him in an unofficial capacity. For months Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has been trying to stir up concerns about Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm. An official in that country told The Daily Beast that Trump is seeking compromising information.

Trump himself has said ""it doesn't matter"" if the President of the United States is engaged in this slimy business. In comments to reporters Friday, he added: ""I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate.""

Hope for real clarity on the matter is dimmed by the fact that Trump enjoys rubber-stamp support from the Republican-controlled Senate, which has approved nearly all of his nominees for federal positions only to see a record number leave their posts in short order. Most recently Trump was forced to withdraw his nominee for the top job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency amid an FBI investigation. FEMA is part of the Department of Homeland Security, where ""acting"" officials are found in striking numbers at the top of the organizational chart.

""Actings"" are running things across the administration. In fact, the director of national intelligence caught up in the latest mess, Joseph Maguire, is on temporary assignment and, therefore, lacking the gravitas of an appointee who really owns the job. Although officials who lack permanent status surely suffer for it, their insecurity seems to suit Trump's seat-of-the-pants style. He has said he prefers provisional appointees because they are more readily moved in and out of positions. They might also be assumed to be more vulnerable to whatever pressure the White House applied.

The downside, of course, is that ""acting"" leaders may struggle to get anything done or to win the respect of their troops. (Imagine, for example, an army going into battle under a general whose stars were applied with Velcro and whose orders are under constant presidential review.)

Indeed, Trump has spent his life making sure that those who serve him feel like they are never quite secure, while at the same time he has sought to make himself immune to examination. As President, he has long banned note-takers from some talks with foreign leaders and then limited White House reporting on his phone calls with them. The current whistleblower controversy appears to be yet another case of Trump seeking ways to avoid accountability.

The Washington Post reported that White House records indicate that that Trump had had ""conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks"": Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.

CNN reported Thursday that the White House and the Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the nature of the whistleblower complaint isn't covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers.

According to CNN : ""Previously the White House has cited longstanding precedent in refusing congressional requests for documents related to Trump's meetings with his Russian counterpart. 'It is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct of foreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,' White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to Democrats in May.""

The President defends his secretive dealings with foreign leaders by insisting that America's international success depends on his personal rapport with them. He says he has great relationships with the likes of Putin, North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, China' President Xi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia have all caused trouble to America during the Trump era, and his brand of personal politics hasn't seemed to help any. Instead, it has reinforced the suspicions that many held toward Trump when he was just a self-promoting businessman.

Back then, of course, his business was his business. Today, he acts on behalf of the American people. Earning their trust requires that he follow the rules."

1. Whistleblower scandal

OK, this story is really complicated, so let's just start at the beginning. A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence not to share the complaint because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN.

Then, yesterday the Washington Post and New York Times reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters have pushed for the Ukrainian government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says, and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Here are 5 key questions about the whistleblower case.

2. Justin Trudeau

Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a third incident emerged of him wearing brownface or blackface , he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal and other recent political hiccups could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month.

3. Israel

It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we still don't know who will be leading the country . Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock.

It is hard to see how any of this ends well.

Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out.

Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts.

The details of the controversy unleashed when a whistleblower sounded the alarm about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public.

The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.

""The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,"" Giuliani said.

Trump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as ""highly partisan"" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to ""a certain foreign leader"" were ""pitch perfect.""

Trump tweeted: ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!""

Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.

But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day.

Disturbing possibilities

There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader.

His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

""Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?"" Trump tweeted on Thursday.

CNN reported Thursday that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions.

He would not say whether those instances involved Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN.

The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over.

Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over.

The Washington Post on Wednesday said the complaint referenced a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy.

The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President.

But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as ""urgent and credible"" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws.

The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing.

A President maligned?

If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached.

The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a ""Deep State"" bent on overthrowing him, will grow.

If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed.

The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump.

""He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,"" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.""If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected.""

""This is an unconstitutional argument,"" Schlapp said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack.

According to three CNN sources , the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers.

The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege.

But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up.

And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage.

Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member.

House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds.

Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government.

That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing.

""The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,"" the California Democrat said.

""Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law.""

The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny.

And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment."

Democrats want to move forward with impeaching the president, while The New York Times has just launched an effort to do the same with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

The “new” Kavanaugh story relates to an anecdote published in the book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, written by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. The Times ran a review of the book over the weekend that focused in part on that accusation and flagrantly drove readers toward the conclusion that Kavanaugh had lied under oath and needed to be impeached.

There was a small problem with the story, however.

Mollie Hemingway, Sr. Editor at The Federalist and author of the bestseller Justice on Trial, The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court, took to Twitter to point out that the female protagonist from Stier’s story had said she had no recollection of the incident and didn’t know what Stier was talking about. The Gray Lady was forced to issue a correction on Sunday. Nonetheless, Democrat candidates for president all began to call like lemmings for Kavanaugh’s impeachment.

Along with the mass hysteria manufactured by Democrats since 2016, they now are seeking to corrupt the Constitution for the purpose of removing not one, but two high-ranking government officials from office. Impeachment, the ultimate political punishment, is an awful process used only when someone in office has committed provable transgressions of the most serious variety—not to be used as just another weapon among many in the modern political arsenal. Democrat presidential candidates have thrown this time-honored restraint aside in the era of Trump.

Since the Democrats have become so fond of impeachment, let’s use their own logic and see who else might qualify for the “political death penalty.”

His actions certainly meet the criteria necessary to invoke the most serious of all political processes. I move at this time to take up the matter of impeaching Joe Biden for his actions on behalf of his son, Hunter, while serving as Vice President of the United States.

I floated this last Wednesday on Twitter. Mostly tongue-in-cheek at the time, I wrote the following:

Did you know former presidents (and VP’s) can be impeached? If the Democrat House proceeds with impeachment against Trump, the Senate should hold hearings to investigate how Biden’s son received $1 billion from the Chinese days after flying with his father to China. Investigate!

The premise for a post-office impeachment would be to disqualify someone from future service. While it has never been used, there was some discussion about attempting it back in 2001 after Bill Clinton left office and his pardon of Mark Rich had people justifiably enraged. Perhaps it’s time to give it a try?

Article 1, Section 3 of the United States Constitution reads, in part, as follows:

Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

Peter Schweizer, President of the Government Accountability Institute, has been instrumental in spearheading the investigative journalism that has exposed Biden’s self-dealing activities while vice president. There are two clear and distinct incidents of corruption, one involving China, the other involving Ukraine.

In 2013, Joe and Hunter flew together on Air Force Two to China for a visit. Less than two weeks later, Hunter’s investment banking firm, Bohai Harvest RST, inked a $1 billion — later expanded to $1.5 billion — investment deal with a Chinese banking subsidiary. That started a process which led to the Chinese acquisition of the American company Henniges Automotive, specializing in dual technologies with military applications. The Chinese actually only acquired a controlling 51% interest. Hunter’s company acquired the other 49%.

Three years later in Ukraine, Joe Biden admittedly played an instrumental role in forcing Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin out of his job in 2016 while the general was investigating a company called Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden was on the Board of Burisma at the time and was being paid a monthly retainer of $50,000.

In 2018, during a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden bragged about strong-arming the Ukrainian government, recalling himself saying, “’If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.”

If this is new to you, no, I’m not making this up.

Unlike the unsupported fables surrounding the actions of Brett Kavanaugh during the last century, the actions of Joe and Hunter Biden are factually documented and took place in just the last administration. This is an impeachment effort people should be able to get behind. At least, it’s an impeachment effort that would likely be deemed justifiable in the eyes of the law.

I know full well that an impeachment of Joe Biden is not going to happen. What I also know is that an impeachment of President Trump and Justice Kavanaugh shouldn’t happen. Will either of them? At this point, the only voice of reason in the Democrat Party when it comes to impeachment is Speaker Pelosi. Those are words I never thought I’d write. It’s also a premise upon which I can never comfortably rest.

Heaven help us if the Democrats manage to defy Sen. Lindsey Graham’s famous confirmation hearing rebuke, and secure the power they so desperately seek.

A Wall Street Journal report suggested that President Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in the eastern European country.

Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani has said that Biden, as vice president, worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter.

The Journal report arises as a whistleblower filed a complaint within the federal intelligence community regarding the president’s communication with the Ukraine government.

Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle called this issue the lastest “bite at the collusion apple.”

Lewandowski told Boyle that the media want to ignore Biden’s potential political scandal by focusing on Trump’s communication with foreign powers.

“Well, Matt, it’s because the memory of the national media — CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS — have been so disappointed that the Mueller Report did not say that the president colluded or coordinated with an outside organization that impacted the outcome of the election,” the former Trump campaign manager said. “They want to bypass the fact that Joe Biden, in his own words, in multiple interviews, said that he threw the straw and had to go to the Ukraine and have a conversation and tell them to fire the individual that was doing the investigation into his son, or else they were going to withhold military aid to the Ukraine.”

Lewandowski added that the “media narrative” now is, “Oh, my God, Donald Trump might have had a conversation, asking if there was anything done” related to the Hunter Biden investigation while they hyperventilate about Trump talking to Zelensky.

“It’s a total double standard,” he added.

Lewandowski noted that the media continue to speculate while trying to undermine the president. He said the House Democrats do not have enough votes to impeach President Trump, so they have to focus on other non-scandals to attack him.

“It’s all speculation, and this is all media narrative. After the Democrats were crushed this week in the House Judiciary Committee, they don’t have the votes to impeach the President of the United States. There is a fight between Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler and AOC over how they can keep the caucus together,” Lewandowski said. “They see that the 2020 election is going to be a larger margin of victory for Donald Trump than it was in 2016 in an Electoral College perspective.

Lewandowski also told Breitbart News Saturday that he “hopes to have an announcement soon” to reveal if he will run for the U.S. Senate to unseat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in 2020. Should Lewandowski run for the Senate, he would become an early GOP frontrunner, according to a recent poll.

The former vice president, who for months has refused to discuss the business dealings of his youngest son, Hunter Biden, has undertaken with foreign governments, accused Trump of misusing his authority while attending the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa.

“This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,” Biden told reporters at the event. “To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things … this is outrageous.”

The former vice president’s comments come one day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump allegedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma Holdings.

The younger Biden joined the natural gas company’s board of directors in April 2014, where he was purportedly paid more $83,000 a month, despite having no prior background in the energy industry. At the same time, the then-vice president was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

More troubling is the fact that at the time of Hunter Biden’s appointment, Burisma was actively seeking to curry favor with western leaders, especially those in the U.S., after its business practices had come under scrutiny.

In April of 2014 — the same month that Hunter Biden joined Burisma’s board of directors — the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to the company’s founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukraininan minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his official position to issue oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

The controversy surrounding Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Zlochvesky only grew more muddy in 2016 when the then-vice president pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, overseeing the investigation into the company. Officially, Biden claimed the threat to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. to Ukraine came from President Barack Obama, who was worried Shokin had lost credibility with western leaders. Regardless of the reasoning, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zchlovesky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Biden even bragged about the effectiveness of his threat during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,'” Biden said. “Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

The former vice president, however, did not mention the context of his or his son’s dealing with Ukraine while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday. Instead, Biden swiveled between attacking Trump for allegedly asking Ukrainian authorities to investigate the situation to denouncing the media for covering the story.

“You should be looking at Trump,” Biden told reporters when discussing the topic. “Everybody looked at this and everybody who’s looked at it said there’s nothing there. Ask the right question.”

As Peter Schweizer, a contributing editor at Breitbart News and the author of a book detailing Hunter Biden’s ties to both China and Ukraine, noted on Friday, the former vice president’s line of attack shows he wants “the issue to go away.”

“The Bidens are not disputing that he got paid all this money,” Schweizer told Breitbart News Tonight. “They’re not disputing that Hunter Biden had no background in this area. They just simply want the issue to go away, and what apparently President Trump did was have a conversation with the now-Ukrainian president, saying, ‘You need to investigate this. I think you need to investigate this,’ and that’s something we’ve been calling for for a long time.”"

CNN‘s Stephen Collinson reported Friday that the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications,” citing an official briefed on the matter:

Instead, the whistleblower’s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration’s determination that the complaint didn’t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

CNN buried the revelation 22 paragraphs into the article titled, “New revelations deepen scandal over Trump whistleblower complaint.”

The new revelation complicates the accusations against the president, which first surfaced in the Wall Street Journal this week.

The newspaper reported that an anonymous whistleblower claimed President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine during a phone call in July.

The report said the business dealings were between Hunter Biden and an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch while Joe Biden was Vice President.

Trump has defended himself against the allegations, calling the whistleblower’s statements “highly partisan” in a tweet on Friday.

He also called the accusations another “witch hunt” in a separate tweet on Saturday.

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” the president tweeted.

When asked whether he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in the conversation, Trump did not confirm or deny it.

“It doesn’t matter what I discussed,” he said. “But I will say this, somebody ought to look into Joe Biden’s statement because it was disgraceful.”

The president discussed the story during a meeting with the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the White House.

Democrats have seized on the story after reports said that the conversation in question had to do with Ukraine, speculating that Trump inappropriately discussed Biden in the conversation, colluding with a foreign government to win re-election.

Trump suggested that the press investigate Biden’s actions in Ukraine.

“Somebody ought to investigate, but the fake news doesn’t investigate Joe Biden because he is a Democrat,” he added.

When he was vice president, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire a prosecutor that was also investigating an energy company, of which his son Hunter Biden was serving on the board.

President Donald Trump reportedly urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s son — Hunter Biden — and his business dealings in the eastern European country, according to a Friday-published Wall Street Journal report. The allegation follows reports that a whistleblower filed a complaint in relation to the president’s communications with Ukraine.

Schweizer said, “Hunter Biden, in a sense, went around the world and cashed in on his father’s access. One of those places was in Ukraine, [with] an energy company named Burisma, which is headed by a very corrupt oligarch named Zlachevsky, [that] hired him as an advisor and a board member in April of 2014.”

LISTEN:

Schweizer continued, “What’s interesting about this is that Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas or anything like that, but of course his father, the vice president at the time, was the point person on U.S. policy towards Ukraine, and the money we’re talking about here is eye-popping. Hunter Biden was getting $83,000 a month from this Ukrainian energy company where he had no background.”

Schweizer went on, “So the immediate question becomes, he’s not selling his expertise — because he has none in this field — what is he getting paid for? That is the issue, and Ukrainian officials in the prosecutor’s office decided to investigate, and they started to investigate, at which point Joe Biden would later brag about getting the prosecutor fired, who has the head of that office, and Joe Biden said that he threatened to withdraw a billion dollars of our taxpayer money in aid to Ukraine unless they fired this prosecutor, so that’s what the issue revolves around.”

“The Bidens are not disputing that he got paid all this money,” noted Schweizer. “They’re not disputing that Hunter Biden had no background in this area. They just simply want the issue to go away, and what apparently President Trump did was have a conversation with the now-Ukrainian president, saying, ‘You need to investigate this. I think you need to investigate this,’ and that’s something we’ve been calling for for a long time.”



Schweizer repeated earlier calls for an investigation of Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings in countries with which his father executed U.S. foreign policy as vice president.

“I think Ukraine needs to investigate it, but also the U.S. Department of Justice, because let’s remember, Ukraine is a terribly corrupt country — it’s been plagued with that for a long time — and this is something that’s too serious, we can’t just leave it to Ukrainian prosecutors to look into,” Schweizer stated.

News media outlets such as the Washington Post are framing the aforementioned “whistleblower” event as a “Trump scandal” while the “underlying issue” is Joe Biden’s possible monetization of political influence during his vice presidential tenure, assessed Schweizer.

“I think the larger issue here, I’m kind of astonished, the Washington Post is kind of covering the issue of this whistleblower, which of course they should, and we’ll have to see exactly when the dust settles, what exactly was said and what exactly happened, but there’s no reporting of the underlying issue,” remarked Schweizer. “There’s no reporting of the fact that the vice president’s son was going around the world — to Ukraine, to China, there are financial transactions involving Kazakh oligarchs, there’s money going from Swiss bank accounts to the vice president’s son — and ask me, [or] ask a lot of people — do we really want to have a country where it becomes acceptable and commonplace for this kind of behavior to take place? And I think the answer is, ‘No.'”

Schweizer maintained, “It needs to be investigated. They need to be held to account, and by the way, I think that if you change the name from Hunter Biden to Don Jr. or Eric Trump, I think you would have an entirely different tone by the media and by the Congress, and that’s a shame, [because] it should be consistent with whoever’s doing it. They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal, and I think what we need to do is focus on the larger issue here that the Biden family was getting millions of dollars from these overseas connected people going to Joe Biden’s son to allegedly do work that he had no qualifications to do.”

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” asked Schweizer. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

Joe Biden’s Democrat competitors in pursuit of the Democrats’ presidential nomination have neglected to highlight the former vice president’s potential conflicts of interest related to Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings. No news media figures hosting Democrat events marketed as “presidential debates” have, thus far, asked Joe Biden about Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings.

According to Change Research, Harris’s saving grace is the slight edge she has among black voters in the state, with a three-point lead over Biden.

Change Research reports:

Sanders leads among 18-34 year-old voters in California with 45% of the vote, followed by Warren with 18% and Harris and Yang, both with 8%. Among 35-49 year old voters, Warren leads with 28%, followed by Sanders (23%) and Harris (14%). Support for Sanders significantly drops among voters 50 years and older. Warren (26%) leads Biden (25%) by 1-point among voters 50-64 years old, while Warren and Biden are tied among voters 65 years and older, each with 29%. Kamala Harris leads among black voters with 27%, followed by Biden (24%), and Warren (21%). Asian voters support Biden (22%), followed by Warren (21%), Sanders (18%), and Yang (14%). Among Latinx voters, Sanders leads both Warren and Biden by 17-points with 35%. Warren leads white voters with 31%, followed by Sanders (19%), and Biden (16%).

The results follow a California Emerson College poll released this week, showing Sanders and Biden leading the field in California with 26 percent support each, and Warren coming in third place with 20 percent support. Harris fared worse in the California Emerson College poll, falling behind for a fifth-place position with just six percent support.

Harris’s ongoing struggle in recent polls has caused her campaign to shift its strategy, pumping resources into Iowa. The California lawmaker made headlines this week after telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa”:

A leaker in the intelligence community, an anti-Trump partisan who almost certainly broke the law with these leaks, a swamp creature who is probably under investigation and about to face the music, is screaming whistleblower to cover his swampy ass — which is like a rapist claiming to be an OB-GYN.

And naturally, our fake news media, who relied on this swamp creature’s illegal leaks (most of which were almost certainly lies), see this stupid scandal as a way to accomplish a number of things…

Protect a partisan “anonymous source” who gives the media cover to spread lies.

Fabricate yet another WALLS ARE CLOSING IN ON DRUMPF news cycle.

Distract from the fact that The Wall-Wall is actually being built, Trump’s border enforcement moves with Mexico and other countries are working, that the “imminent recession” is looking a lot less imminent, and We really need to talk about something other than our latest smear about Brett Kavanaugh being debunked!

Distract from yet-another left-wing hero — Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau — caught in blackface.

A fer-real whistleblower busted the New York Times admitting it would ignore real reporting over the next 18 months to instead scream racism at Trump. So now that that’s not working, let’s go back to Trump colluding with a foreign country to rig an election.

Oh, and I almost forget this one…

Protect Democrat front-runner Joe Biden from a LEGITIMATE scandal.

And that’s another reason this fake scandal is so lame. The media have created a Rube Goldberg of a mess where an outlaw leaker is a whistleblower but we don’t know what he knows but we think he knows Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate the Biden family’s shady deals because suddenly it might be wrong to tie American foreign aid to a country cleaning up corruption which is something America’s been doing forever.

Did I cover everyZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz….

And this is how we know the media cobbled this “scandal” together in desperation… It’s a horrible contraption.

You see, when the media take their time, they are able to come up with a much simpler and therefore more effective fake news-scandal: Karl Rove leaked a CIA operative’s name, Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election, George Bush never showed up for National Guard duty, Mitt Romney put a dog on the roof of his car. (Oh, wait, that last one is actually true.)

Everyone knows that if you want to get away with a lie, you have to keep it simple.

No, officer, I have not been drinking works a lot better than No, officer, I don’t drink and drive because that would be wrong — you know, other than a beer on a full stomach; okay, sometimes two, but never more than three… Why are you asking me to step out of the car?

Another mistake is that the political face of this fake scandal is Adam “we got the Russia goods” Schiff.

Was Joe Isuzu not available?

What’s more, are the media stepping into a trap? The Biden family’s shading dealings with Ukraine are a real problem for the Democrat frontrunner. This story stinks to high heaven. Until now, the media have diligently fought to protect Biden by ignoring the whole thing. But now… the media are talking about it.

Obviously, the media are hoping to boomerang a serious vulnerability for Biden into a vulnerability for Trump, but in doing so they are letting the cat out of the bag, which gives Trump a real opportunity to blow it up — to reveal to the world that Biden supposedly told Ukraine they would not get foreign aid unless the government ceased investigating his son, which sounds a whole lot worse than Trump saying, If you want American taxpayer money, you need to clean up this corruption.

The American people, though, have tuned the media out. The polls show it and so do the ratings. Hell, even Trump-hating Democrats have come to learn that within a few days all these “scandals” are eventually debunked.

Anyway, the whole thing is convoluted and stupid… The latest act of a corrupt and desperate media longing for the good old days when the Russian Collusion Hoax was firing on all cylinders.

Interesting… According to the odds, @AndrewYang has the best chance of beating @realDonaldTrump. Head-to-head matchups: pic.twitter.com/7tBtkipJSv — Dave Mason (@DaveMasonBOL) September 19, 2019

Trump is the biggest underdog (+150) when matched up against Yang, and the president is actually the biggest favorite (-200) against former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Betonline’s odds. Trump is a slight underdog against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and a potential race between Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is essentially a tossup (-120).

Yang, who has called himself Trump’s “kryptonite,” has been making the case on the stump that he actually gives Democrats obsessed with ousting the president the best chance of defeating Trump because, in addition to progressives, Yang also brings in disaffected Trump voters and some libertarians into the fold as well.

As Breitbart News has noted, Trump revealed at a campaign rally that the “only thing” the president worries “about is that some total unknown that nobody’s ever heard of comes along” and gets the nomination. Yang and his allies believe Yang is that non-establishment politician who can give the Trump campaign the most trouble.

Forbes has also speculated that Yang “just might be that unknown” Trump fears because the entrepreneur “seems to be the only Democratic candidate thus far that understands the psychology of persuasion.”

After a recent Emerson New Hampshire poll found that only Biden did better against Trump in a potential general election battle in the Granite State (Yang beat Trump by eight percentage points in the poll), the hashtag “#YangBeatsTrump” trended for days.

Yang is in sixth place in polling average, but he is still well behind Biden, Sanders, and Warren in every state and national poll."

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that an anonymous whistleblower claimed President Trump asked Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine during a phone call in July.

The report stated:

“He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know” if his lawyer’s assertions that Mr. Biden acted improperly as vice president were true, one of the people said. Mr. Giuliani has suggested Mr. Biden’s pressure on Ukraine to fight corruption had to do with an investigation of a gas company for which his son was a director. A Ukrainian official this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son Hunter Biden.

“Mr. Trump in the call didn’t mention a provision of U.S. aid to Ukraine, said this person, who didn’t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on any investigation,” the report concluded.

An Associated Press report stated that “Democrats condemned what they saw as a clear effort to damage a political rival, now at the heart of an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump.”

The report continued:

It was the latest revelation in an escalating controversy that has created a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, which has refused to turn over the formal complaint by a national security official or even describe its contents.

However, President Trump defended himself against the accusations in a tweet on Friday, calling the whistleblower’s statements “highly partisan”:

The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!

HuffPost reported:

In a wide-ranging interview with HuffPost, the Democratic presidential hopeful said he once shared progressives’ skepticism of nuclear power but became convinced that reaching net-zero emissions from the utility sector by 2030 was impossible without the source that generates more power than all forms of renewables combined. … “As much as we say the Republicans when it comes to climate change must listen to science, our party has the same obligation to listen to scientists,” Booker said. “The data speaks for itself.” … “If we had a president who was going to pull us out of nuclear, we’d be more reliant on fossil fuels,” Booker said. “It’s as simple as that.”

As Breitbart News reported, Booker told the CNN town hall that “people who think we can get” to zero emissions by 2030 “without nuclear being part of the blend just aren’t looking at the facts.”

Of the frontrunners for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, only former vice president Joe Biden has not ruled out nuclear energy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) both reject it. Businessman Andrew Yang is the only other Democratic candidate, aside from Booker, who has fully embraced nuclear energy.

“Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country,” his campaign stated.

“In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace,” it continued.

However, one of Sanders’ visits will occur Wednesday, days after presidential rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) visit with the striking auto workers. She is expected to join the United Auto Workers “on the picket line outside GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday,” according to Reuters.

Sanders, for his part, has told GM to “end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,” Reuters reports.

The problem is plastic straws it’s corporate greed #globalclimatestrike — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) September 20, 2019

For example, check out this braggadocious Instagram post.

Additionally, the she’s is a huge proponent of JetSmarter, which has been dubbed the “Uber of air travel.” It’s the “first global digital marketplace for private aviation” which makes booking flights on private jets a breeze for carbon footprint producing celebrities like Ratajkowski.

Ratajkowski’s private jet usage — while decrying the use of plastic straws and “corporate greed” — is not an isolated phenomenon. Over the summer, celebrates and elites, who say they are committed to fighting climate change, flew across the globe to attend a “Google Summer Camp” to discuss climate change.

As Breitbart News reported:

Traditionally held every year at the end of July, the famed Verdura Resort hosts the top-secret gathering, with the three-day summer camp costing the tech giant some $20 million, sources told the Post. Many of the guests, including Obama and DiCaprio — who has his own climate change foundation — have described global warming as the biggest threat to future generations. Forbes reports numerous yachts are currently moored off the beach at Verdura Resort having discharged their passengers; German pharmaceutical titan Udo J. Vetter’s sailing yacht Aquarius, Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg’s sailing yacht EOS, Graeme Hart’s yacht Ulysses with others en route including David Geffen’s yacht Rising Sun, Google’s Eric Schmidt’s yacht Infinity and its support vessel Intrepid, among them. According to Italian press reports, the attendees were also expected to show up in 114 private jets, of which 40 had arrived by Sunday.

They are not the only notable figures who have demonstrated a seeming disregard for the looming planetary “crisis” by using private air travel, with Joe Biden (D) spending $256,000 on private plane travel from the start of his presidential bid through July and the Sanders campaign spending $297,685.50 on private air travel over the span of nine days, it was reported last year.

Ratajkowski’s rant comes on the same day that students around the country are skipping school to join in on the global climate strike. What’s more? More than 90 percent of the planet’s plastic waste comes Asia and Africa. Straws in the United States account for about 0.03 percent of global plastic pollution."

Pollak,"But according to Andrew Pollack (no relation), whose daughter, Meadow, was among the victims in the Parkland school shooting last February, those policies allow potentially dangerous people to keep a clean record, letting them pass firearm background checks.… [+3569 chars]",Several Democrats running for their party's nomination in 2020 are backing a policy of easing school discipline -- one that allowed the Parkland gunman to buy a firearm.,2019-09-20,Breitbart News,Blue State Blues: Democrats Back Policy That Helped Lead to Parkland Shooting,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/09/20/blue-state-blues-democrats-back-policy-that-helped-lead-to-parkland-shooting/,"Several Democrats running for their party’s nomination in 2020 are backing a policy of easing school discipline, arguing that they want to stop a “school-to-prison pipeline” that hurts minority students.

But according to Andrew Pollack (no relation), whose daughter, Meadow, was among the victims in the Parkland school shooting last February, those policies allow potentially dangerous people to keep a clean record, letting them pass firearm background checks.

That was the case with the gunman at the Marjorie Stonemason Douglas High School.

As Pollack explains in his new book, Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies that Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America’s Students, the gunman had a record of erratic, disruptive, and violent behavior, and yet was not isolated from other students, nor was he arrested despite dozens of police visits, or committed to a mental health facility.

At one point, the gunman was put in a program called “Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Support and Education” (PROMISE). The program, promoted by President Barack Obama, protected students who committed crimes at school from being reported to police. “Even felonies as severe as drug dealing, sexual assault and bringing weapons to school could lawfully be kept from the police,” the Wall Sreet Journal noted.

When the gunman-to-be did not show up for the PROMISE program after being caught vandalizing a middle school bathroom, there were no consequences. And as Max Eden, a Manhattan Institute fellow who co-authored Pollack’s book, said last year, the gunman undoubtedly committed other crimes for which no action was taken by the school: “[L]et me assure you, he committed crimes that school administrators knew about but did not record,” Eden said.

Democrats claim that gun control is necessary to prevent mass shootings, in schools and elsewhere. But as debate over proposed new “expanded background checks” continues, no one is examining the effect of “politically correct” school policies like PROMISE.

The two are connected: if a potentially dangerous person has never been arrested, convicted, or committed to a mental facility, there will be no red flags in the record for a background check to find.

Amazingly, several Democratic candidates are campaigning on pledges to restore programs like PROMISE, despite the demonstrated risks.

Former vice president Joe Biden’s criminal justice reform policy, which he is promoting enthusiastically to minority voters as penance for his tough-on-crime past, pledges to “[e]nd the school-to-prison pipeline” by “restor[ing] the Obama-Biden Administration guidance to help schools address the high number of suspensions and expulsions that affect students of color at a higher rate than white students.”

Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) echoed those sentiments in the third presidential debate, claiming that “in Texas, a 5-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin.”

The implication is that the public school teachers — who may be minorities themselves — are racists.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law last week that actually prevents school from suspending “defiant” children up through eighth grade. Democrats say the law will help “children of color.” More likely, it will prevent timely intervention to help them change their behavior.

For all their talk about ending gun violence, Democrats are undermining an early warning system on which background checks rely, making another Parkland more likely.

The North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA) said it canceled the game at North Stanly High School because “Stanly County Schools has been notified of additional information that could compromise safety measures our schools have in place for sporting events,” according to the Charlotte Observer.

However, that did not stop the cheerleader’s supporters from continuing with their plans to hold the rally outside the school’s football stadium in New London on Friday.

“There was no threat,” said organizer Jeremy Onitreb during the event. “Nobody’s coming up there to hurt the kids. It’s not what this was about.”

In a Facebook live video on the event page, Onitreb said the school district canceled the game because someone wanted to prohibit the cheerleaders from exercising their right to free speech.

“The reason they decided to cancel the game is because somebody out there wanted to shut down our free speech so bad — they wanted to shut this rally down so bad — that they were willing to call the school and threaten the school,” he commented.

On September 17, Breitbart News reported that the cheerleaders were placed on probation after they posted a pre-game photo of themselves holding the pro-Trump banner on social media.

The school claimed that some students said the photo made them feel “uncomfortable” and decided to place the cheerleaders on probation for the remainder of the football season.

“One of the rules we have is that every contest should be conducted in a wholesome, athletic environment,” said NCHSAA Commissioner Que Tucker. “We take that to mean that it’s in an environment where good sportsmanship is shown, where people feel safe … that respect for all people participating is being shown.”

However, reports said school officials did not make it clear what “additional information” they received that caused them to cancel the football game.

At the rally on Friday, attendees wore Make America Great Again hats and waved Trump 2020 flags and American flags to show their support for the cheerleaders.

“If there’s a Bernie flag, if there’s a Biden flag, I don’t care,” Onitreb said, “In this country, we have the right to support who we want, and that’s what this is about.”"

Instead of trying to cover up Harris’s obvious frustration with her position in the presidential race, her campaign decided to expand on her salty quote, with her communications director Lily Adams promoting a shirt quoting her boss:

The Harris campaign sent out a fundraising email with the subject “‘I’m f**king moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” according to the Washington Examiner.

“She cut to the chase!” the body of the email stated, according to the Examiner. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

Despite the campaign’s attempts to add an element of levity to Harris’s remarks, she confirmed to reporters that she is, in fact, torn and frustrated.

“I cannot only be in Iowa, because South Carolina is also a state that is very important, that I care about,” she said.

“Until we have campaign finance reform, I need to fundraise,” she continued. “So it can be frustrating, frankly, to have to make these decisions that feel like a trade-off, but I plan to spend as much time as I can.”

Harris’s remarks follow weeks of a downward trend in the polls, both nationally and in key primary states. An Iowa poll released Wednesday showed Harris dropping to sixth place in the Hawkeye State, having just five percent support:

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Dean Obeidallah

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert.

The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers.

Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said.

He's been urged along by his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.

A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on.""

Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call, Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York.

Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.

The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons.

The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.

Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself.

""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""

Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy.

That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.

Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.

The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors.

Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States.

People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks.

""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen.""

At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed. The money was released last week

It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky.

But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government.

Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed.

""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."

Elizabeth Warren is challenging Joe Biden's dominance in the race for the Democratic nomination, standing at 22% to the former vice president's 20% in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president).

The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders).

Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers.

Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange.

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation . That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists.

The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a refusal last week by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during his scheduled appearance Thursday.

The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts and a continuing impeachment investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion.

Pressure to impeach

Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript.

""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of calling on Congress to immediately launch proceedings.

Schiff, who has so far resisted joining other Democrats in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings.

On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior.""

Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""

""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.

White House split on releasing calls

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.

The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things.""

But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""

Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert.

The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers.

Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said.

He's been urged along by his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.

A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on.""

Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call, Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York.

Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.

The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons.

The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.

Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself.

""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""

Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy.

That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.

Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.

The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors.

Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States.

People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks.

""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen.""

At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed. The money was released last week

It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky.

But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government.

Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed.

""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."

Despite calls from Ocasio-Cortez and Warren, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has taken a more cautious approach, calling impeachment “a divisive approach.”

Pelosi added that Democrats should look at all the facts before deciding to move forward with impeachment proceedings.

The increase in Democrat calls for impeachment comes from an August whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official amid efforts from Democrats to learn more about Trump’s ties with Ukraine. These same Democrats are trying to get ahold of the complaint.

Trump acknowledged that he had talked with the Ukranian president about an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden while speaking with reporters on trips to Texas and Ohio on Saturday.

That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

(CNN) I've been hearing a new conversation in coffee shops and happy hours around the country. One friend makes their prediction of who will win in November 2020, and the other nods in agreement. But then the voices become hushed as the second person asks, ""But do you really think the other side will accept the results?""

We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.

So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines -- believe that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?

Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.

We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.

Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.

And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?

Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination is tightening between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.

The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters would prefer to vote for Elizabeth Warren. They think she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter enthusiasm by double digits.

But nearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.

If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.

All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.

As David Leonhardt noted in the New York Times this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points , for instance.

Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows. Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse.

We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.

""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,"" she wrote in a tweet Friday evening . ""By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.""

(CNN) President Trump treats many of his official appearances as campaign events. His public engagements often focus on criticizing his perceived political rivals and touting himself, and he even kicked off his last UN General Assembly speech with a personal report card on how much he thinks he has accomplished. He's bashed the UN repeatedly, but he may want to try a different approach this time around.

The UN General Assembly is always a high stakes event for national security, but this year's gathering will take place amid rising tensions with Iran, a nuclearizing North Korea, the degradation of the global nonproliferation agenda, ongoing humanitarian crises and more.

And the UNGA already has a dark cloud hanging over it. As world leaders descend on New York City, they are already well aware of the urgent whistleblower complaint, lodged by a member of the intelligence community, concerning at least one of President Trump's communications with a foreign leader as well as Trump's own admission that he discussed Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, the President said , ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption).""

These world leaders may be convinced Trump is more concerned about his own political standing than the security of the American people. This waters down the credibility of any US national security work as our peers wonder whose interests the President and his team are really serving: America's or Trump's.

Trading places

The United States has often been a champion for promoting the rule of law and anti-corruption around the world, including through the UN. The concept of the rule of law is even embedded in the UN charter -- and through the State Department and other US government entities we have programs focused on advancing it overseas. However, our ability to advance rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives globally takes a direct hit when the President is viewed as a poster child for the kind of actions we're trying to get other countries to stop doing.

President Trump reportedly pressed Ukraine's President Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, a source told CNN . And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that he also asked the Ukrainian government to investigate the former Vice President, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing from either Joe Biden or his son Hunter.

This news only bolsters the idea that the President is abusing his power to engage in self-dealing. Allegations of nepotism, emoluments violations , channeling business to Trump properties and more have already painted a picture of a President doggedly pursuing self-interest. Taken with new allegations of self-dealing and abuses of power, other leaders may now need to include anti-corruption talking points on their agenda when meeting with President Trump.

We have urgent business with Ukraine, including helping them to deter Russian aggression. Instead, because of the President's reported actions, the meeting may be overshadowed by the whistleblower complaint, Giuliani's efforts, and getting the story straight on their last phone call.

Ukraine has already been roped into this domestic US issue. Their Foreign Minister issued a statement saying that Zelensky didn't feel pressured and that Ukraine is an independent state.

Zelensky and his team are trying to walk a fine line between keeping the President happy (they must know his ire has consequences ), without drowning in his political hot water. Fighting Trump's battles is likely not a priority for Zelensky. He has real ones of his own -- including an ongoing armed conflict with Russia -- going on at home.

This dark cloud of potential conflicts of interest and abuse of power will likely carry over into other meetings as well, like the President's meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Polish President Andrzej Duda, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Even before the whistleblower complaint and the administration's decision to freeze security assistance to Ukraine earlier this year, world leaders were aware that Trump is willing to cut off foreign assistance to countries who won't (or can't) do his bidding. The idea that the President relies on explicit or implicit quid pro quos to score political wins has only been bolstered by recent events. Foreign leaders now have good reason to wonder whether incoming Trump requests are campaign 2020 calls or actually have to do with national security.

Fairweather fan

While Trump's bilateral meetings at the UNGA this week will be critical, his approach to the United Nations itself may indicate that he's a fairweather fan of the United Nations.

Even before he assumed office, President Trump had railed against the United Nations, saying it was "" not a friend of democracy ,"" and as President-elect he said the UN was causing problems and would be a waste of time and money if it didn't live up to its potential.

This year, the President may need to turn to the UN for support. While the formal UN agenda includes a host of topics that the President doesn't like -- including climate change and sustainable development -- he's probably going to try to get other member states to focus on what's top of mind for him, like reports that Iran was behind the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after several months of illegal activities in international waters, and a host of other malign activities. Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior will likely be a key topic for Trump in both public and private discussions.

The administration recently rolled out new sanctions against Iran and announced the deployment of more US forces to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But these actions would benefit from UN backing. We've already cut off most transactions with Iran and these unilateral US sanctions probably won't have a lot of bite unless we're willing to punish foreign entities and individuals who violate our new sanctions or the UN passes similar ones. So making a compelling case about Iran's activities at the UNGA may be on top of Trump's to-do list.

Odd man out

While he's seeking to convince his global peers about the threat from Iran, Trump will probably try to water down their focus on another malign actor: North Korea.

North Korea conducted several missile tests over the last few months -- a sign of its advancing arsenal -- and experts say its nuclear stockpile is expanding. Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton said that North Korea's missile tests violate UN Security Council resolutions , but Trump still downplayed the missile tests . His stance on North Korea will likely be at loggerheads with that of our allies at the UN and will add to the general perception that there is no coherence when it comes to Trump's approach to rogue regimes.

(CNN) Ukraine has again returned to center stage in a critical international pirouette involving Russia and the United States for the first time since Moscow annexed Crimea five years ago. With media reports suggesting that President Trump pressured Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son during a phone call in July, a host of complex diplomatic and political forces have converged again in this corner of eastern Europe.

Zelensky, a former comedian, secured a landslide election victory in April . With no previous experience as a politician, he has to confront Russia's occupation of Crimea, as well as the ongoing conflict in the eastern region of Donbas with Russia-backed separatists.

This may be a unique moment in the modern history of Ukraine. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who are driven by their own respective political agendas, have suddenly inserted themselves in the midst of what could become an international imbroglio with Ukraine.

But Putin, Trump and Zelensky have converging interests, and all three could potentially come out as winners in a scenario that leads to the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, lifted sanctions on Russia, and the reelection of Trump.

Now, Ukraine appears to have become at least as critically important to Donald Trump, for a whole different set of reasons. It is here, Trump seems to believe, that he can pin charges of corruption on the son of Vice President Joe Biden , a Democratic candidate he clearly fears. And suddenly, both he and Putin appear now to have a Ukrainian president in power who is at the very least open for dialogue.

At first, Zelensky supported Ukraine's eventual membership in the European Union and NATO —both moves utterly anathema to Putin. Then the new Ukrainian leader proposed ending the war with Russian-backed forces in the Donbas by negotiating with Putin, and struck a hostage exchange with the Russian president that was lauded by President Trump as a ""first giant step to peace.""

The allegation against the Bidens has been debunked by respected fact-checking teams at news organizations including CNN. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to replace its top prosecutor, who was unpopular among many Western leaders due to concerns regarding corruption. It's also unclear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.

Despite this, it appears Trump and Giuliani believe Zelensky should look into the matter. In May, Giuliani abruptly canceled his trip to Ukraine a day after he announced his intentions to meet with Zelensky in Kiev. Instead, he traveled to Spain in August, and met with Andriy Yermak , a lawyer who serves as the president's aide.

According to Politico , the State Department said that the meeting had been facilitated by Kurt Volker , who has served abroad under four American presidents and is currently executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership and US Special Representative for Ukraine. I have known Volker as an individual of the utmost probity, and he, like the most seasoned American diplomats, clearly understands the need for all sides to feel as though they are coming out as winners.

Which may be where the interest of all three key players converge. Consider this scenario. Putin would no doubt very much like to see a second term for Trump. Already, the American president is pressing fellow members of the G7 to welcome Putin back into the club next year, and floating the idea that he will host the summit at his Miami golf resort

If Trump wins the 2020 election, he'll be freed from any need to win the support of voters. Trump would also presumably be free to move toward lifting sanctions against Russia, no matter how strenuously Congress -- and the rest of the western alliance -- might protest.

Zelensky, for his part, could do a big favor for Putin by digging into whatever Giuliani might want to help his client's presidential re-election effort. Putin, in turn, might even reciprocate by easing up on military actions in Donbas (though it is unlikely ever to return Crimea to Ukraine).

In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump suggested he was not acting in his own personal interest by saying ""I always look for the conversation that's going to help the United States the most."" In the same discussion, he also described the whistleblower, who filed an official complaint, as having a ""partisan"" agenda

The US released a $250 million military aid package days after three House committees announced a wide-ranging probe that would, among other things, look into whether such packages were being held hostage for the president's own political benefit. It is not unreasonable to expect that any future transactions would be smoothed by congenial relations between Zelensky and Trump, or even Putin.

The key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away? And how might this play out the next time Zelensky faces re-election, after winning a landslide victory on an anti-corruption campaign?

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

(CNN) In 2015, Corey Lewandowski was a low-profile political operative. Sean Spicer was a spokesman and strategist for the Republican National Committee. Neither looked likely to star on national TV.

Then along came Donald Trump, who gave both prominent jobs.

And last week, former White House Press Secretary Spicer was twirling in a lime-green ruffled shirt, dancing with the stars. And former Trump campaign manager Lewandowski, defiant in a red tie and jacket, was tangling with and frustrating the House Judiciary Committee's Democrats in a hearing that many could only label absurd.

Spicer's much-hyped re-emergence was not okay, wrote, and she wasn't referring to his dance moves. ""Sean Spicer's entire claim to fame (or infamy) comes from lying for a president who uses his office to lie, to side with dictators, to defend men who abuse women and work for him, to separate families, to stand up for white nationalism and much, much worse. Spicer lied for a liar for a living.

Lewandowski, who's considering a run for a US Senate seat in New Hampshire, got an equally bad review from legal analyst: "" Lewandowski was a truly horrible witness. His demeanor was the stuff of a trial lawyer's nightmares. He was angry, combative, sarcastic, and more intent on getting off personal insults and pumping up his impending Senate campaign than actually answering questions or getting Congress or the public any closer to truth.""

Harry Litman warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue Writing about the Lewandowski hearing in the Washington Post,warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue to distort and darken our politics long after he himself has left the scene .""

Then there's Rudy Giuliani.

Michael D'Antonio, "" The former New York City mayor actually had a national reputation before his immersion in Trumpworld, but has added a new cast to it. In a contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo about an intelligence whistleblower allegation, wrote, "" Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog...both denied and confirmed that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden."" (There's no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.)

David Andelman, raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin In a July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly suggested working with Giuliani on such an investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Zelensky may have a lot to gain from good relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. That, wrote, raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away?""

Frida Ghitis asked, ""What exactly could President Donald Trump have done that...drove a US intelligence official to file a formal whistleblower complaint over communications between Trump and an unidentified foreign leader...?"" She added, ""we have encountered another secret in a presidency that has been defined by obfuscation and falsehoods...

The A team is long gone

Peter Bergen. Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed. Now that generals James Mattis, John Kelly and H.R. McMaster have left the administration, along with CEOs Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson, the President has ""surrounded himself with yes-men and is running his Cabinet like he used to run his real estate company -- as a one-man show surrounded by flunkies ,"" wrote. Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed.

One of the first things on O'Brien's agenda is how to respond to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, which the Trump administration blamed on Iran.

Trump and his team have said many times that the President was willing to meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions -- but last Sunday Trump tweeted that was ""fake news."" It must be ""amnesia,"" Bergen noted. "" Trump's posturing back and forth between aggression and conciliation might work for a real estate deal in Manhattan, but it's quite confusing and the stakes are also much higher when you are dealing with the complex calculations of a major regional power such as Iran.""

Kavanaugh redux

The controversy over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh resurfaced in a big way with the publication of a piece in the New York Times opinion section drawing on a new book by two of the newspaper's reporters. There was something for all sides to focus on.

Jill Filipovic wrote, ""explores and corroborates previously under-reported claims by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that when she was a student, Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face as a joke. According to news reports, the FBI never fully investigated her claims, nor interviewed the people who reached out to them to corroborate. Thanks to constraints put in place by the White House, sources told CNN, the FBI also never interviewed Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor Kavanaugh himself.

Thanks to constraints put in place by the White House, sources told CNN, the FBI also never interviewed Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor Kavanaugh himself. The 'investigation' was a sham, and the Trump administration made it that way .""

The Times came in for withering criticism for its handling of the piece, since -- while it described an additional allegation against Kavanaugh -- it failed to point out that the woman allegedly involved did not remember the incident, according to her friends, and declined to speak to reporters (The Times added an editor's note with those points after the piece was originally published).

Kathleen Parker wrote, ""The recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M.

Marc Thiessen welcomed the call by some Democrats to impeach Kavanaugh: ""As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should.

Elie Honig blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations. That's definitely not its role, wrote Honig. Still, the calls for impeachment are futile: "" blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations.

The short SNL career of Shane Gillis

Days after Saturday Night Live announced that comedian Shane Gillis would be joining its cast, the show fired him for what it called his past ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable"" remarks. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang had waded into the controversy, saying that it would be a mistake to dismiss Gillis for his 2018 podcast comments, which included anti-Asian slurs.

An 'imposter'?

Michael Bociurkiw. ""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year -- In the midst of a challenging election campaign, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to try to explain why he wore brownface or blackface at least three times. Amid his apologies, he admitted he didn't know how many times he had darkened his skin. ""Canada's elections take place on October 21, and it's looking like a tough race,"" wrote. ""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year -- is certainly not the way Trudeau wants to be seen.

Janaya Khan suggested that, for Trudeau, ""blackface is a mere obstacle to overcome in his campaign run after receiving rebukes this week for darkening his face several times in the past. But for the millions of black, Indigenous and other people of color in Canada, this is far more than a simple scandal. Blackface is a reminder that people of color are suggested that, for Trudeau, ""blackface is a mere obstacle to overcome in his campaign run after receiving rebukes this week for darkening his face several times in the past.

Be nice to the coral reefs

The storms that have devastated the Bahamas are a reminder of the fragility of coastlines. Marine scientist Michael Beck wrote that endangered coral reefs are much more than a tourist attraction. They ""act as submerged breakwaters, they 'break' waves and protect communities and wetlands that further block waves and storm surge. ...coral reefs dampen more than 97% of waves before they reach coastlines. Losing just one meter from the top of a reef allows an exponential increase in the wave energy that passes through to the shore. This would lead to a doubling in the cost of flooding during storms for coral reef coastlines in more than 60 countries around the world.""

Beck noted, ""Storms have shaped our shorelines for millennia, and for most of that time our reefs and wetlands stood as guardians against those storms. Without them, we have only ourselves .""

For just one September week each year, everyone from kings, presidents and prime ministers on down to food tasters fly in to New York City and jam into the United Nations headquarters, in what has become a cliched joke about "" diplomatic speed dating ."" But there's nothing funny about the top priority at this 74th year of UNGA year, which is the world's climate emergency.

The United Nations Climate Summit

The UN has arranged a special Climate Action summit on Monday September 23, before the formal speeches given by heads of state and governments that normally draw the most attention. Breaking with tradition, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told country leaders not to come to the podium Monday without ""concrete and transformative plans"" to halt rising global temperatures, achieve carbon neutrality and cut carbon emissions by 45 percent. VIPs with proposals have been told they have just three minutes to speak.

How concrete the results of the summit will actually be is unclear. The UN doesn't have a global climate army to roam the planet stopping pollution, so it's up to the 193 nations of the UN to take action. What the UN will actually do is what some feel the organization sadly does best: collecting the speeches and other environmental brainstorms in a report.

The aim is to pressure world leaders to do more, as the climate emergency worsens. Some have made it a top priority -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be in town for the climate summit, even though she's skipping the rest of the week. In contrast, US President Donald Trump will be in town, but he's skipping the climate summit -- instead hosting a session on religious persecution in the same building. Trump has previously avoided international meetings on climate.

Let the General Debate begin

The so-called ""general debate"" begins on Tuesday September 24, and the first country to speak is Brazil, by longstanding tradition. It'll be the debut UNGA appearance of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who recently vowed to attend even if in a wheelchair, following recent surgery. Expect fireworks: After high global concern over massive fires and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon , the pro-business Bolsonaro is likely to take climate advocates head-on. He has already promised a ""speech that is different from those that came before"".

Following him will be Donald Trump, who has stuck to the teleprompter previously, and last year drew laughter from delegates while praising his own administration.

The volume of Trump's appearances and his unpredictability have dominated the past two years of Trump at the General Assembly. Last year, he shocked the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister by accusing Beijing of interfering in US elections while both men sat at the Security Council table.

Trump was also the first US President to enter the building and take just a few steps before stopping in front of cameras and shouting reporters, to answer hot topic questions for three days. ""He completely sucked the oxygen out of UNGA,"" Richard Gowan, UN Director at the International Crisis Center says.

The elephant in the secretariat

A senior UN official stated, ""tensions in the Gulf are going to be the backdrop to a lot of events and meetings."" Which leads us to the biggest question on the eve of UNGA: Will President Trump meet Iranian President Rouhani?

‎Nothing is planned between the two leaders, though both will be in the UN building amid the parade of delegations. The threats and rhetoric lobbed by both sides have been fierce. The US imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday before the high-level week begins, and the Iranians say they don't need to talk.

It looks like ""a zero chance for a meeting,"" says Gowan. ""Instead of a diplomatic breakthrough, we're likely to see a war of words."" The UN is meant to be a neutral ground for dueling sides to have dialogue, and chance face-to-face encounters are exactly what this international forum is good for. In 2000, then-US President Clinton and then Cuban President Fidel Castro suddenly stopped briefly for each other in a hallway, when relations between the nations were running cold. There is still a debate whether a handshake took place

Who's coming to UNGA?

As of Friday, 91 heads of state had committed to attend. French President Macron will be in New York offering an expanded French leadership role as a global mediator, as the Trump administration pulls the US back from international forums.

‎With significant angst at home over the UK's planned withdrawal from Europe, Boris Johnson will make his first UNGA appearance in his role as prime minister. Brexit talks are scheduled with Ireland's leader and others.

And Indian leader Narendra Modi and Pakistan's leader Imran Khan are both attending and speaking in the General Assembly. No talks are scheduled between them for now, as tensions remain high over India's treatment of Kashmir, a disputed territory.

And of fresh interest to American audiences will be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who debuts at UNGA right in the middle of a growing controversy: The US Congress wants to know if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son , who had business ties in the country. Biden, of course, is one of the main contenders for the US Democratic primary and could end up challenging Trump for the presidency next year.

There are also UN meetings big and small on Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, and Myanmar. Apart from marathon hours of speeches, consider this: 630 meetings have been requested. The UN defines a meeting as a gathering of 15 or more people held within the UN for a maximum of three hours.

There are ""no less challenges than last year"" affecting geopolitics around the world, said British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce. Expect demonstrators near the UN all day -- though the targets of their anger may not even see them through their tinted limousine windows as they rush to the UN, sirens sometimes wailing.

The list of leaders who will not appear this year is also interesting: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping rarely attend, and will not be present this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has canceled, amid a post-election muddle back home. Netanyahu, a former UN Ambassador, relishes his General Assembly speeches -- often with props of charts and diagrams -- and he has previously made for must-see TV in between lengthy boring speeches by others.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been listed as a speaker, but is no longer coming in the wake of multiple revelations of black- and brownface photos that surfaced from his past, just before national elections.

President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has sent his regards but will not leave his turmoil-filled nation. His rival for the Venezuelan presidency -- National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, whose presidential authority has been acknowledged by more than 50 countries, including the US -- is unlikely to show but representatives will push the UN for future recognition of Guaido's claim to power.

Although the immediate premises of the United Nations are international ground, the United States is still the host. According to the ""host country"" agreement, visitors traveling for official UN business are not supposed to be barred, and there was once a time when the US would impose a generous 25-mile radius cordon on international visitors it didn't like.

But this year, the US is not holding back. In addition to the movement restrictions on Iran's Zarif, two Cuban diplomats living in New York who had planned to participate in UNGA were ordered expelled by the Trump administration, in a surprise Thursday announcement. And the remaining diplomats at the Cuban mission face the toughest restrictions among all countries: They're not allowed to leave the narrow island of Manhattan.

And with all the traffic and security blockades, New Yorkers and tourists ‎too may feel no one can get off the island during this madhouse week."

Entirely missing from the brazen fundraising email is the larger context of the story, which spotlights significant questions about Biden’s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period where his son, Hunter Biden, received $50,000 a month from a natural gas company there.

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

None of that was mentioned in the Biden campaign’s fundraising email, sent under the subject line of “about Ukraine.”

“Eight. That’s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family,” the email complains.

The missive continues:

This sort of behavior tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump and the people around him. Every day he is in office, he does something to cheapen and debase the presidency. But it also tells you what he’s worried about. If I’m our Democratic nominee, we will make sure he’s a one term president. It won’t be easy. But I know, with your help, we will beat Trump. Please, I need you with me at this critical moment. Chip in to my campaign tonight.

The email presents donation options from $5 to $250 and another option for “other”, linking to the ActBlue donation site.

The message to potential supporters, signed by Biden, concludes: “Every individual donation to our campaign tonight sends a message to Donald Trump, the Russians who interfered with our elections in 2016 and almost certainly will again, and everyone else that you know we will win the battle for the soul of our nation.”

A second campaign email, titled, “disgusting,” used similar language and also utilized the Ukraine allegations to ask for donations.

Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden during the call with Zelensky but said that nothing inappropriate was done. “No quid pro quo, there was nothing,” Trump commented to reporters on the White House South Lawn. “It was a perfect conversation.”

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he’s going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.”

Biden, meanwhile, boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

Yoshiko M. Herrera, a Russia and Eurasian policy expert from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was quoted by the Washington Post saying that Biden’s position was “a conflict of interest even if it doesn’t break any laws.”

“Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,” Herrera stated. “Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.”

A New York Times editorial opined that Hunter Biden’s role in the board of Burisma undermined his father’s credibility in Ukraine issues.

The newspaper stated:

Sadly, the credibility of Mr. Biden’s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices. A spokesman for the son, Hunter Biden, argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance. That may be so. But Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine. It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father’s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.

The former vice president told reporters during a campaign appearance in Iowa on Saturday that he denied ever having discussed his son’s position on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas company.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily told reporters, before accusing President Donald Trump of abusing his power by urging the Ukrainian government to investigate the matter.

The former vice president’s claim, however, is contradicted by Hunter Biden’s own words on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do'” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

The contradicting stories between father and son only underscore the multiple unanswered questions already plaguing the situation. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden was asked to join the Bursima board of directors in April 2014, despite not having any experience with Ukraine or the energy industry. Even more concerning to ethics watchdogs is the fact that at the same time Hunter Biden was tapped for the $83,000 a month job, his father was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

As Breitbart’s contributing editor Peter Schweizer noted in his book on the scandal, Hunter Biden joined Burisma at time when the company was seen as actively courting western leaders after its business practices came under scrutiny. The same month Hunter Biden joined the group, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

The former vice president became entangled in the matter when he pushed the government of Ukraine to fire the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the company and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing in 2016. Officially, Joe Biden claimed his threat to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. loans to Ukraine came from then-President Barack Obama, who was worried Shokin had lost credibility with western leaders. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zchlovesky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Despite the shadowy entanglements that seem suggest a conflict of interest, neither Joe Biden nor his son have been willing to address the topic until earlier this week when news broke that Trump had requested Ukrainian authorities to probe the matter. The president defended his decision on Sunday, pointing out there were too many unanswered questions, especially given the Ukraine’s long history of public corruption.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,” Trump told reporters before departing the White House for Houston, Texas.

Trump added that Joe and Hunter Biden had damaged their credibility by contradicting each other.

“This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son,” the president said. “Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said long before that he did speak to his son. So he lied again.”"

Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, discussed the mounting controversy involving former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukraine.

Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo he saw it as the end of the elder Biden’s 2020 presidential bid.

“I mean, look, there’s a lot. Look, the left knows that Biden’s son is a problem for him,” he said. “This is why, when Hillary Clinton was running, these stories first originated — first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure that Biden didn’t get in the race.”

“So, now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme,” Nunes continued. “Maybe there really is — this whistle-blower is not a partisan. I mean, we want to — we want to hear from that whistle-blower. But it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And this — like I said, I think this is probably the end of Biden’s campaign.”

“End of his campaign?” Bartiromo replied.

“I really do. I don’t think — I mean, not that he’s — he’s still formidable,” Nunes answered. “He still has a bloc of support. But if you look, his lead is basically down to zero. If you look at what happened in Iowa now, it looks like Elizabeth Warren is in the lead.”

A Wall Street Journal report suggested that President Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in the eastern European country.

Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani has said that Biden, as vice president, worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter.

The Journal report arises as a whistleblower filed a complaint within the federal intelligence community regarding the president’s communication with the Ukraine government.

Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle called this issue the lastest “bite at the collusion apple.”

Lewandowski told Boyle that the media want to ignore Biden’s potential political scandal by focusing on Trump’s communication with foreign powers.

“Well, Matt, it’s because the memory of the national media — CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS — have been so disappointed that the Mueller Report did not say that the president colluded or coordinated with an outside organization that impacted the outcome of the election,” the former Trump campaign manager said. “They want to bypass the fact that Joe Biden, in his own words, in multiple interviews, said that he threw the straw and had to go to the Ukraine and have a conversation and tell them to fire the individual that was doing the investigation into his son, or else they were going to withhold military aid to the Ukraine.”

Lewandowski added that the “media narrative” now is, “Oh, my God, Donald Trump might have had a conversation, asking if there was anything done” related to the Hunter Biden investigation while they hyperventilate about Trump talking to Zelensky.

“It’s a total double standard,” he added.

Lewandowski noted that the media continue to speculate while trying to undermine the president. He said the House Democrats do not have enough votes to impeach President Trump, so they have to focus on other non-scandals to attack him.

“It’s all speculation, and this is all media narrative. After the Democrats were crushed this week in the House Judiciary Committee, they don’t have the votes to impeach the President of the United States. There is a fight between Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler and AOC over how they can keep the caucus together,” Lewandowski said. “They see that the 2020 election is going to be a larger margin of victory for Donald Trump than it was in 2016 in an Electoral College perspective.

Lewandowski also told Breitbart News Saturday that he “hopes to have an announcement soon” to reveal if he will run for the U.S. Senate to unseat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in 2020. Should Lewandowski run for the Senate, he would become an early GOP frontrunner, according to a recent poll.

The former vice president, who for months has refused to discuss the business dealings of his youngest son, Hunter Biden, has undertaken with foreign governments, accused Trump of misusing his authority while attending the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa.

“This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,” Biden told reporters at the event. “To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things … this is outrageous.”

The former vice president’s comments come one day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump allegedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma Holdings.

The younger Biden joined the natural gas company’s board of directors in April 2014, where he was purportedly paid more $83,000 a month, despite having no prior background in the energy industry. At the same time, the then-vice president was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

More troubling is the fact that at the time of Hunter Biden’s appointment, Burisma was actively seeking to curry favor with western leaders, especially those in the U.S., after its business practices had come under scrutiny.

In April of 2014 — the same month that Hunter Biden joined Burisma’s board of directors — the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to the company’s founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukraininan minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his official position to issue oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

The controversy surrounding Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Zlochvesky only grew more muddy in 2016 when the then-vice president pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, overseeing the investigation into the company. Officially, Biden claimed the threat to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. to Ukraine came from President Barack Obama, who was worried Shokin had lost credibility with western leaders. Regardless of the reasoning, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zchlovesky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Biden even bragged about the effectiveness of his threat during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,'” Biden said. “Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

The former vice president, however, did not mention the context of his or his son’s dealing with Ukraine while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday. Instead, Biden swiveled between attacking Trump for allegedly asking Ukrainian authorities to investigate the situation to denouncing the media for covering the story.

“You should be looking at Trump,” Biden told reporters when discussing the topic. “Everybody looked at this and everybody who’s looked at it said there’s nothing there. Ask the right question.”

As Peter Schweizer, a contributing editor at Breitbart News and the author of a book detailing Hunter Biden’s ties to both China and Ukraine, noted on Friday, the former vice president’s line of attack shows he wants “the issue to go away.”

“The Bidens are not disputing that he got paid all this money,” Schweizer told Breitbart News Tonight. “They’re not disputing that Hunter Biden had no background in this area. They just simply want the issue to go away, and what apparently President Trump did was have a conversation with the now-Ukrainian president, saying, ‘You need to investigate this. I think you need to investigate this,’ and that’s something we’ve been calling for for a long time.”"

Biden, who has largely remained the frontrunner as several national polls indicate, fell to second place with 20 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) followed in a distant third with 11 percent support. The margin of error is +/- four percent.

The Des Moines Register added that “no other candidate reaches double digits,” with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in fourth place with nine percent support, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropping to fifth place with six percent support, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) garnering three percent support each.

Four candidates – Beto O’Rourke (D), Tom Steyer (D), Andrew Yang (D), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI)– garnered two percent. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less.

Selzer & Co. president J. Ann Selzer called the results the “first major shakeup” in the Democrat primary race.

“It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board,” Selzer said, according to the Des Moines Register.

The poll also found Warren’s favorability at 75 percent, with Buttigieg right behind with 69 percent.

CNN‘s Stephen Collinson reported Friday that the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications,” citing an official briefed on the matter:

Instead, the whistleblower’s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration’s determination that the complaint didn’t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

CNN buried the revelation 22 paragraphs into the article titled, “New revelations deepen scandal over Trump whistleblower complaint.”

The new revelation complicates the accusations against the president, which first surfaced in the Wall Street Journal this week.

The newspaper reported that an anonymous whistleblower claimed President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine during a phone call in July.

The report said the business dealings were between Hunter Biden and an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch while Joe Biden was Vice President.

Trump has defended himself against the allegations, calling the whistleblower’s statements “highly partisan” in a tweet on Friday.

He also called the accusations another “witch hunt” in a separate tweet on Saturday.

“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” the president tweeted.

“This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said long before that he did speak to his son. So he lied again.”

The president spoke to reporters as he left the White House on Sunday for a visit to Houston, Texas, for a rally with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Trump campaign highlighted on Saturday Biden’s claim that he had “never” spoken to his son Hunter about his business interests overseas. Hunter, however, admitted in an interview in July that he spoke “just once” to his father about his business in Ukraine.

The president ripped Biden’s son Hunter for accepting a board position at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, earning as much as $83,000 a month while his father was leading foreign relations with the country as vice president.

“The son, he knew nothing, the son is a stiff, he knew nothing,” Trump said. “And he’s making hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, and he did the same thing in Ukraine, he knows nothing.”

Trump said that he “wasn’t looking to hurt Biden” despite possibly running against him for president but criticized Biden for threatening to cut aid from Ukraine if they did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma Holdings.

“He said a very foolish thing,” Trump said, referring to Biden.

Hunter Biden’s role with the Ukrainian energy firm and his deals with China were exposed in Peter Schweizer’s bestselling book Secret Empires.

In recent weeks, the establishment media has focused on Trump’s phone calls with the Ukrainian president, reportedly asking the government on multiple occasions to investigate Biden.

But Trump has insisted that his conversations with the Ukrainian president were not bad, even appearing willing to release the transcript.

President Donald Trump reportedly urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s son — Hunter Biden — and his business dealings in the eastern European country, according to a Friday-published Wall Street Journal report. The allegation follows reports that a whistleblower filed a complaint in relation to the president’s communications with Ukraine.

Schweizer said, “Hunter Biden, in a sense, went around the world and cashed in on his father’s access. One of those places was in Ukraine, [with] an energy company named Burisma, which is headed by a very corrupt oligarch named Zlachevsky, [that] hired him as an advisor and a board member in April of 2014.”

LISTEN:

Schweizer continued, “What’s interesting about this is that Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas or anything like that, but of course his father, the vice president at the time, was the point person on U.S. policy towards Ukraine, and the money we’re talking about here is eye-popping. Hunter Biden was getting $83,000 a month from this Ukrainian energy company where he had no background.”

Schweizer went on, “So the immediate question becomes, he’s not selling his expertise — because he has none in this field — what is he getting paid for? That is the issue, and Ukrainian officials in the prosecutor’s office decided to investigate, and they started to investigate, at which point Joe Biden would later brag about getting the prosecutor fired, who has the head of that office, and Joe Biden said that he threatened to withdraw a billion dollars of our taxpayer money in aid to Ukraine unless they fired this prosecutor, so that’s what the issue revolves around.”

“The Bidens are not disputing that he got paid all this money,” noted Schweizer. “They’re not disputing that Hunter Biden had no background in this area. They just simply want the issue to go away, and what apparently President Trump did was have a conversation with the now-Ukrainian president, saying, ‘You need to investigate this. I think you need to investigate this,’ and that’s something we’ve been calling for for a long time.”



Schweizer repeated earlier calls for an investigation of Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings in countries with which his father executed U.S. foreign policy as vice president.

“I think Ukraine needs to investigate it, but also the U.S. Department of Justice, because let’s remember, Ukraine is a terribly corrupt country — it’s been plagued with that for a long time — and this is something that’s too serious, we can’t just leave it to Ukrainian prosecutors to look into,” Schweizer stated.

News media outlets such as the Washington Post are framing the aforementioned “whistleblower” event as a “Trump scandal” while the “underlying issue” is Joe Biden’s possible monetization of political influence during his vice presidential tenure, assessed Schweizer.

“I think the larger issue here, I’m kind of astonished, the Washington Post is kind of covering the issue of this whistleblower, which of course they should, and we’ll have to see exactly when the dust settles, what exactly was said and what exactly happened, but there’s no reporting of the underlying issue,” remarked Schweizer. “There’s no reporting of the fact that the vice president’s son was going around the world — to Ukraine, to China, there are financial transactions involving Kazakh oligarchs, there’s money going from Swiss bank accounts to the vice president’s son — and ask me, [or] ask a lot of people — do we really want to have a country where it becomes acceptable and commonplace for this kind of behavior to take place? And I think the answer is, ‘No.'”

Schweizer maintained, “It needs to be investigated. They need to be held to account, and by the way, I think that if you change the name from Hunter Biden to Don Jr. or Eric Trump, I think you would have an entirely different tone by the media and by the Congress, and that’s a shame, [because] it should be consistent with whoever’s doing it. They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal, and I think what we need to do is focus on the larger issue here that the Biden family was getting millions of dollars from these overseas connected people going to Joe Biden’s son to allegedly do work that he had no qualifications to do.”

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” asked Schweizer. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

Joe Biden’s Democrat competitors in pursuit of the Democrats’ presidential nomination have neglected to highlight the former vice president’s potential conflicts of interest related to Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings. No news media figures hosting Democrat events marketed as “presidential debates” have, thus far, asked Joe Biden about Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings.

Mark Meadows (R-NC) dismissed allegations from a so-called whistleblower claiming President Donald Trump used the power of his office to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden.

Meadows said he had been following the storyline since May and categorized it as a hoax and deemed the whistleblower as illegitimate.

Partial transcript as follows:

PIRRO: Wow. So let’s talk about all this with Republican Congressman Mark Meadows, who joins me now live. Okay, Congressman, so the issue seems to be that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter’s business in the Ukraine, where it’s estimated he made millions in a business with which he had no expertise or training.

So when he is asked and the initial part of that sound, you know, whether or not he talked to his son about doing business in the Ukraine? The answer is no. His own son answered in a “New Yorker” piece, and I think we have a full screen of it, and he said that he had spoken to his father, as Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma, which was that company with him just once. “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing.’ And I said, I do.”

So right on its face, Joe Biden either didn’t recollect or intentionally misled or lied by saying he never spoke to his son about the Ukraine and the business there.

But more significant, the interview where Joe Biden kind of takes a victory lap and says, hey, look, I got the prosecutor fired, because I was withholding billions from Ukraine. What’s your take on that?

REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, my take on that is exactly the kind of thing that they’ve been accusing President Trump of all along. Can you imagine if the prosecutor in Ukraine, if his name was Bob Mueller, what would have happened? Oh, my gosh, I mean, everything would have gone — I want to talk about Ukraine.

You know, the Democrats have really walked into it, because I can tell you that the investigation with regards to Joe Biden’s son, and also the investigation in terms of other D.N.C. operatives working in the Ukraine, happened months ago. We’ve been following this. I’ve been working on this since back in May. So I can tell you this is just not a Russian hoax. This is a Ukrainian hoax, and it’s not even by a legitimate whistleblower.

I mean, there’s been reports, Judge out there that actually the whistleblower didn’t learn about any of this on the job. Actually, it was hearsay. And so when you start to look at the bottom line of all of this is, one, it does need to be investigated. And so I’m calling on my Democratic colleagues, let’s look at it. And I think at the end of the day, Joe Biden will be the one that is left with egg on his face.

PIRRO: All right. So while we talk about the Democrats trying to get information of this whistleblower, and going after the President. It appears that the Democrats may be hoisted on their own petard, given the fact that if you want to talk about Ukraine, if that, indeed, is the conversation that the whistleblower is talking about, there is nothing that is more corrupt than withholding money, in an effort to get a prosecutor to drop an investigation.

And my sources are telling me that not only did he not give that money, Joe Biden, our taxpayer money until the prosecutor was fired, but he had a hand in saying who the second prosecutor was.

So let me ask you this. If the President — and Rudy Giuliani has talked about this, if the President had a conversation into whether or not Joe Biden leveraged American money to stop the Ukrainian investigation, wouldn’t that be a legitimate ask, as long as there is no mention of money? No quid pro quo? No direction as to how it should end up? Doesn’t the President have a right to ask that question?

MEADOWS: Well, he certainly has the right to ask that question. As long as he doesn’t do what Joe Biden did, which says we’re going to hold some money unless you have a particular type of action.

You know, listen, there have been rumors about this before for a long time, obviously, Joe Biden is even bragging about the fact that he used leverage on American taxpayer dollars. But more importantly than that, when we start to see the connection with Ukraine, and what we have now is a new government in Ukraine. So all of a sudden, the protections are falling apart.

The President is right to ask about it. Certainly, if he did, you know —

PIRRO: He did, right.

MEADOWS: Here’s the thing is, you know, we don’t even know what the conversation was all about. And I believe, in fact, I have a strong belief and informed belief that indeed, nothing inappropriate happened. And I can tell you here tonight, that what we’re going to do is get to the bottom of it.

You know, there’s another person, Judge and I know that perhaps we’re not prepared to go here. But there was also a D.N.C. operative, Miss Chalupa that was paid in 2016 dollars to work with Ukraine. And you know what they said that she was doing, working on a women’s outreach in Ukraine.

Well, maybe that’s why Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin and lost Pennsylvania, because they were working on women’s outreach in a foreign country.

PIRRO: But you know what? This is eerily like Russia, when they want to accuse the President — and they are starting to do that — of doing something wrong with the Ukraine, it’s like a boomerang. It comes back and it hits them.

Again, Hillary with the Ukraine, Joe Biden and his son. His son had no expertise in energy making millions. And then in China, the reports are, he made a billion dollars working in China. The Chinese are not stupid. They are not stupid people, and for them to pay that kind of money.

And in fact, I was reading in “The New Yorker” article that there was an individual that Joe Biden — Hunter Biden, the son was involved with, who wanted to meet Joe Biden. And then Hunter went with his father and Joe Biden, and introduced his father, the Vice President to this Asian partner, who ultimately was arrested for corruption, and the partner’s associate was arrested for corruption.

I mean, this is dirty, dirty, dirty. And in the end, I believe that when everything comes up, you know that if Biden did play a central role in the energy policy in the Ukraine, and he is not going to try to turn this around on Donald Trump, that’s the biggest mistake of his life right now.

MEADOWS: Well, a Judge, here is the interesting thing is, I don’t want to falsely accuse anybody of improper behavior. But what we do know is Adam Schiff, and a lot of his Democratic colleagues continue to spin a narrative over and over again, of which they’re guilty of.

You know, they’ll accuse the President of colluding with Russia. Well, the only people that actually worked with the Russians was the D.N.C. and the Clinton campaign, which did it.

I would think at the end of the day, the only people that actually worked with the Ukrainians is that same group, the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and I think you’ll see that, so I welcome us looking at it hopefully Adam Schiff and I can bring in and subpoena some people to really get to the bottom of this, because at the end of the day, it will not be pretty for them.

PIRRO: You know, it’s amazing. The week started out with the left’s plot against the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh and then we’re ending up with another plot against President Trump. Nothing much changes in Washington, does it?

MEADOWS: Well, they keep doing it. You know, they’re trying to throw every accusation at the President and his team as much as they possibly can because they really have nothing.

And they think if they keep going one after another after another, that eventually the American people will side with them. The exact opposite is happening. The exact opposite is happening.

PIRRO: I agree. We’ll see. We’ll see. Congressman Mark Meadows. Thanks so much for being with us this evening.

MEADOWS: Thank you, Judge."

Kerry said, “Well, first of all it’s entirely inappropriate for the president’s personal attorney to be involved in another country trying to find dirt on a presidential candidate, number one. Number two, what President Trump has done is —if he has done it — and the way the move whether he’s done it is release the transcript of that conversation. That’s how you get to the bottom of this. But there is just, you know, for the president of the United States to be leveraging American foreign policy, hocking it, extorting the leader of another country if that’s what has happened is unprecedented, and the last time the president did, that Richard Nixon, the Republican Party stood up and held him accountable for the abuse of power.”

“This Republican Party today is running for cover and actually inadvertently supporting a cover-up if what is alleged is true,” he said. “The only way to get at it is release the transcript. Let everybody see what the president said. If he leveraged American foreign policy and foreign aid to get a president of another country to be the opposition research arm of his campaign, that is a fundamental, profound, and deeply disturbing abuse of power.”

Bernstein said, “Well, I think the first thing is to find out exactly what has happened here. And if the reporting of Shane Harris and The Wall Street Journal is accurate and it seems to be it clearly moves toward a grievance abuse of power by the president of the United States.”

He added, “I keep getting asked are there echoes of Watergate in this? And there are in the following ways, Watergate was an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the democratic electoral process in the United States our basis of democracy by trying through political espionage and sabotage to nominate through political dirty tricks and misinformation its weakest candidate, George McGovern instead of its strongest candidate, Senator Edmund Muskie who Nixon didn’t want to run against.”

“And something in the same thing seems to be happening here, where Biden who Trump and his people said they fear the most in terms of being an opponent has been an object of these perhaps dirty tricks and abuses of power,” Bernstein continued. “One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a big offense if this is what happened, and it seems to be.”

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that an anonymous whistleblower claimed President Trump asked Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine during a phone call in July.

The report stated:

“He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know” if his lawyer’s assertions that Mr. Biden acted improperly as vice president were true, one of the people said. Mr. Giuliani has suggested Mr. Biden’s pressure on Ukraine to fight corruption had to do with an investigation of a gas company for which his son was a director. A Ukrainian official this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son Hunter Biden.

“Mr. Trump in the call didn’t mention a provision of U.S. aid to Ukraine, said this person, who didn’t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on any investigation,” the report concluded.

An Associated Press report stated that “Democrats condemned what they saw as a clear effort to damage a political rival, now at the heart of an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump.”

The report continued:

It was the latest revelation in an escalating controversy that has created a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, which has refused to turn over the formal complaint by a national security official or even describe its contents.

However, President Trump defended himself against the accusations in a tweet on Friday, calling the whistleblower’s statements “highly partisan”:

CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked President Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on Thursday during Cuomo Primetime whether or not he asked the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

“No, I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden,” Giuliani said. “I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which, tangentially, involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme, not unlike what he did in China.”

Sanders faced a stumbling block last month after proclaiming that his Medicare for All plan would “absolutely” erase union-negotiated health benefits:

The Washington Post followed up with a piece indicating that the Sanders campaign modified positions by noting that unions would continue to hold some capacity of negotiating powers via the National Labor Relations Board. However, the Sanders campaign was livid, with members of his campaign calling the report “100 percent wrong” and “bullshit”:

This headline from the Wash Post is 100% wrong – know how I know? Medicare for All is a Senate bill with exact text and co-sponsors. The text hasn’t changed.

Nonetheless, the debate over union health benefits remains a point of contention and a political talking point frontrunner Joe Biden (D) has tried to use to his advantage:"

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

Their participation in the Steak Fry comes one day after Friday’s global climate strike, which several of the candidates adamantly praised:

The North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA) said it canceled the game at North Stanly High School because “Stanly County Schools has been notified of additional information that could compromise safety measures our schools have in place for sporting events,” according to the Charlotte Observer.

However, that did not stop the cheerleader’s supporters from continuing with their plans to hold the rally outside the school’s football stadium in New London on Friday.

“There was no threat,” said organizer Jeremy Onitreb during the event. “Nobody’s coming up there to hurt the kids. It’s not what this was about.”

In a Facebook live video on the event page, Onitreb said the school district canceled the game because someone wanted to prohibit the cheerleaders from exercising their right to free speech.

“The reason they decided to cancel the game is because somebody out there wanted to shut down our free speech so bad — they wanted to shut this rally down so bad — that they were willing to call the school and threaten the school,” he commented.

On September 17, Breitbart News reported that the cheerleaders were placed on probation after they posted a pre-game photo of themselves holding the pro-Trump banner on social media.

The school claimed that some students said the photo made them feel “uncomfortable” and decided to place the cheerleaders on probation for the remainder of the football season.

“One of the rules we have is that every contest should be conducted in a wholesome, athletic environment,” said NCHSAA Commissioner Que Tucker. “We take that to mean that it’s in an environment where good sportsmanship is shown, where people feel safe … that respect for all people participating is being shown.”

However, reports said school officials did not make it clear what “additional information” they received that caused them to cancel the football game.

At the rally on Friday, attendees wore Make America Great Again hats and waved Trump 2020 flags and American flags to show their support for the cheerleaders.

“If there’s a Bernie flag, if there’s a Biden flag, I don’t care,” Onitreb said, “In this country, we have the right to support who we want, and that’s what this is about.”"

""There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it probably, possibly would have been OK if I did,"" he said.

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Dean Obeidallah

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

Billy Porter, who made history merely by being nominated for his role as the exuberant ballroom emcee Pray Tell in FX’s Pose, a show that explores the “juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York: the rise of the luxury universe, the downtown social and literary scene and the ball culture world.”

In his acceptance speech, Porter said that he was “overjoyed” to win the award and believe that as a gay man he has the “right to be here”:

The category is love, you all. Love. I am so overwhelmed and I am so overjoyed to have lived long enough to see this day. James Baldwin said, “Took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I had been taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around this earth like I had the right to be here.” I have the right. You have the right. We all have the right.

Porter’s success was quickly seized upon by Biden, who claimed that he had inspired a young generation of actors.

“Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us,” Biden wrote. “You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you.”

Porter’s acting has been the source of widespread acclaim from critics following the show’s launch last year, in which his flamboyant character Pray Tell is diagnosed with HIV.

The 50-year-old actor is also known for his flamboyance in real life. At this year’s Oscars, Porter turned up on the red carpet wearing custom tuxedo dress as a tribute to Hector Xtravaganza, who passed away last year, from the House of Xtravaganza, known as one of New York City’s most famous underground ballroom houses.

“It’s just a Democrat witch hunt, here we go again,” Trump said, speaking to reporters as he arrived at the United Nations summit on Monday.

He taunted the establishment media and Democrat coalition for failing with narratives surrounding the Russia investigation and falsely raising the alarm of a looming recession, noting that the hysteria over his Ukraine conversation about Biden was only the latest attempt.

“The one who’s got the problem is Biden,” Trump said, pointing out that Biden was the one who actually threatened in 2014 to withhold aid funding from Ukraine until they fired one of their prosecutors.

The fired prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Biden’s son Hunter was getting paid as much as $50,000 a month to serve on its board.

“What Biden did is a disgrace; what his son did is a disgrace,” Trump said, referring to Hunter Biden. “The son took money from Ukraine; the son took money from China, a lot of money from China.”

Trump said he would continue to talk about corruption in Ukraine with the country’s leaders, noting that Zelensky was elected to weed out corruption.

“We’re supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest … Why would you give money to a country you think is corrupt?” he asked.

He hinted to reporters that the White House may soon release the transcript of his phone call with Zelensky to prove that nothing he said in the conversation was wrong.

Trump also questioned the motives of the whistleblower that first complained about the phone call.

Booker said, “It is a betrayal of the office at the scale of which I haven’t seen in my lifetime. I’d have to go back to, God, I don’t think Watergate even compares to what this is.”

He continued, “This is such a betrayal of our ideals. It is such a betrayal of Congressional intent. And he needs to answer for this should the facts bear out. So I hope that this is not people saying, ‘Oh, it’s just Trump being Trump.’ No, this is a deep potential violation of our Constitution, of our values. And it is an impeachable offense.”

He added, “By the way, the fact that we don’t even have the whistleblower’s report in Congress is a violation of Congressional rules. It says in the whistleblower rule that the Inspector General shall give this information to the Intelligence Committee. Shall do it. And then not giving it to Congress alone to me is a violation of our law. So I think this is a moral moment. I think this is a moment of patriotism, Republican or Democrat, to be demanding the truth come out, and hold this president accountable for his actions.”

""Everybody does it,"" Trump said Monday.

That blasé attitude is not reflected in Congress, where the weekend's revelations have led more Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. The worst possible scenario, which not everybody believes, is that Trump used his office and his authority over foreign aid to stir up trouble for a leading 2020 rival.

But the political fight is over more than just whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to get involved in the US presidential election by investigating Biden and his son, Hunter, over Hunter's former business interests. It's also about what must be shared with Congress after a whistleblower raised the alarm, and just how much Trump has changed what's allowed in American politics.

""I'm leading in the polls, they have no idea how they stop me,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday at the United Nations. ""The only way they can try is through impeachment.""

This is a fast moving scandal that's hard to keep track of. Here's what we know about each of the issues at hand:

Did Trump talk to Ukraine's new president about Joe Biden?

Yes. Trump initially denied it, but over the weekend admitted that when he talked to Zelensky on July 25, he brought up Joe Biden. Trump also made clear that in his mind, Biden = corruption.

On Sunday, Trump said of the conversation:

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

The call is part of the whistleblower complaint against Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, a person familiar with the matter said, according to the Journal. While Trump pressed Zelensky, he did not bring up military aid on the call, CNN reported Friday.

Mr. Giuliani is former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has been calling for months for a new inquiry into Biden's role in a corruption purge in Ukraine during the Obama administration. He renewed those calls during a remarkable interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo last Thursday during which he said he asked officials in Ukraine to investigate Biden.

Why is anyone suggesting Trump pressured Zelensky or tied a Biden investigation to military aid?

At the same time Trump was mentioning Biden to Zelensky, Giuliani was actively pushing Ukraine's top prosecutor, who has since left that position, to officially investigate Biden and his son.

That's also about the same time Trump's administration was putting the skids on nearly $400 million aid, including $250 million in military aid and $141 million from the State Department, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on Twitter last week that after he met recently with Zelensky, there was no question the Ukrainian was concerned both about the aid being cut off and about Giuliani's calls for an investigation in Biden.

""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.

I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019

An aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, summed up his contacts with Giuliani in an interview published Monday.

""So, Giuliani and I talked on the phone, and after that we personally met in Madrid. I repeated to him the same points. He noted that it was important for him to hear that the new Ukrainian government would preach the principles of openness and legality, will fight corruption, and set as its goal to make Ukraine successful.""

Who is Zelensky?

Zelensky is a former comedian, and like Trump, a newcomer to politics. Before his election in April, he was better known as the star of a TV show in which he played the President of Ukraine . When he won a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko, he promised to clean up corruption.

Did Zelensky feel pressured by Trump to investigate Biden?

There are conflicting accounts on this. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said over the weekend that his country would not take sides in a US election. ""I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,"" he told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske, according to Reuters . ""This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.""

Did Trump directly tie military aid to Ukraine to investigating Biden?

We don't entirely know. It does not appear Trump ever explicitly told Zelensky that if he didn't investigate Biden, he wouldn't get the military aid. There is a transcript of the call, but it's not clear if or when anyone outside the White House will see it. Some details of the call have been reported, including by CNN

""I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" Trump told reporters on Monday.

He also suggested it's his hope the call's transcript is released: ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon.""

When was the military aid to Ukraine frozen?

CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. Officials from the Office of Management and Budget told officials from the Pentagon and State Department about the freeze at a meeting in mid-July, according to The Washington Post

When and how were the funds frozen?

Trump admitted he withheld the money in comments to reporters at the UN Tuesday. He said he wanted Europe to do more for Ukraine. But then he added the money was ultimately paid. He didn't point out it was ultimately paid because of an objection from Democrats.

""My complaint has always been -- and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,"" he said. Because they not doing it, it's the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money.

Mulvaney has long been skeptical of the aid. Former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not agree on much, but they did agree that Ukraine should get the aid. Congressional staffers say Congress was in the dark on the holdup.

""The administration did not notify us that the aid was frozen,"" according to a Senate aide. ""The House Appropriations Committee learned of it on or about August 23rd and informed us, and then the first news stories appeared days later. In response to our inquiries, DoD confirmed to us that the funds were frozen on August 28th.""

Further, according to CNN reporting, officials in Ukraine were never formally told the funds were being frozen.

Why does Trump keep returning to Biden and Ukraine?

Politics. Trump wants to attack Biden's credibility. Every time Trump is asked about his conversation with Zelensky, he returns to his message about Biden, as he did on Twitter Monday.

""Now the Fake News Media says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.' This supposedly comes from a so-called 'whistleblower' who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.......Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren't pressured at all during the 'nice' call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That's the real story!""

An important note: There have been no serious allegations of specific wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. An investigation into a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board, had been shelved by a prosecutor before Biden and many other Western officials and Ukrainians called for him to step down. Biden had threatened aid in the form of loan guarantees if the prosecutor did not leave office.

When did Trump's focus on Biden and Ukraine start?

This is a story that has been percolating for some time. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating the natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden. CNN reported in August that Giuliani and Yermak, the aide to Zelensky, had spoken several times over the phone and met in Madrid.

Now according to The Washington Post, Giuliani said he has had five conversations with Yermak.

Separately, Giuliani told the Post he did not address the issue of US aid to Ukraine in the Madrid person to person meeting this summer. ""I was not involved in the aid at all,"" he said, referring to military aid. ""I had no idea the $250 million was on the table.""

He said that Yermak was pushing for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president and that the Ukrainians were ""embarrassed"" there had not been one yet.

Giuliani has said he essentially stumbled upon the Biden element. He had been pushing in Ukraine on an effort to clear Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who is currently in jail for tax evasion on money he made for political consulting in Ukraine and elsewhere.

Why does Ukraine need US military aid?

Ukraine is dealing with Russian-backed separatists in the Eastern part of the country and still opposes Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. The country is very much standing between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the West.

What is the aid used for?

The assistance, according to previous CNN reports , is for sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, night vision and military medical treatment -- all of which Ukrainians could use to counter pro-Russian separatists.

What was the official reason that aid to Ukraine was frozen?

The White House has said it wanted to make sure the new administration in Ukraine would stay true to its word and cut down on corruption.

Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, denied earlier this month that the holdup had anything to do with Biden, but he did say, ""We have great concerns about issues of corruption... I mean, to invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine.""

That's very similar to language Trump used Sunday, except Trump tied the idea of corruption in Ukraine to Biden, perhaps further suggesting a link between the money and the investigation.

Trump returned to corruption during his comments to reporters at the United Nations on Monday.

""If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" he said. ""One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption. It's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important.""

How was the aid unfrozen?

There was bipartisan opposition to the freeze up on Capitol Hill. CNN reported on September 12 that the administration had suddenly dropped its opposition to the aid after Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, got bipartisan support for an amendment to force the administration's hand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally who nevertheless supported the aid to Ukraine, gave Durbin credit for making the aid happen.

""So why was it released? Because of your amendment, that's why it was released,"" Graham said during an appropriations hearing earlier in September. ""Because I was going to vote for it, so I think they got the message. If you're listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you're going to get the money.""

Has Ukraine gotten any of the aid?

""The Department of Defense was able to begin obligating these funds last week. We will continue to leverage all available tools to expedite the implementation of these programs. We expect the majority of the funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year,"" according to Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.

Some $60 million had been obligated fairly quickly (as of last Monday), according to a US official. The Pentagon is confident that it can obligate $220 million before the end of the fiscal year and is working with Congress to get an extension to continue the aid delivery. The House voted last week to extend the window for the aid through November.

Why is it important when Trump talked to Zelensky?

It's completely incredible that Trump may have pressured the Ukrainian president, essentially asking him to investigate a US political rival, in the very midst of denying his campaign colluded with Russia's election interference in 2016.

On Wednesday, July 24, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about all of the Trump campaign interactions with Russia in 2016 and explained why his report did not recommend charges against the President or his aides for seeking political help from a foreign government.

""NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!"" Trump tweeted that day and his allies hailed the end of calls for impeachment. Turns out things were just beginning. He talked to Zelensky the next day.

What is the fight over the whistleblower?

While there had been plenty of reporting on Biden's involvement in the Ukraine, on Giuliani's quest to highlight it for campaign season and on the temporary halt of aid to Ukraine, the whistleblower complaint is what tied them all together.

But the White House tried very hard to keep it quiet. While Congress should be entitled under the law to hear about whistleblower complaints, the White House had justified keeping it from Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General informed lawmakers that the complaint existed, but no one outside the intelligence community or the White House has actually seen it.

That's because the DNI has, on the advice of the White House and Department of Justice, resisted providing the report to Congress and have said it is not actually covered by the whistleblower law.

What are Democrats saying?

Even some Democrats who had opposed impeachment proceedings against Trump are now saying there is no alternative.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution,"" said Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez on CNN Monday. ""We must move forward with impeachment proceedings.""

""I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" he said. ""It seems like the President is really pushing us for impeachment proceedings. I don't know if he's baiting us because he has a personal agenda that he thinks this might be helpful to him.""

What is Trump saying now?

He was asked exactly during an appearance Monday at the United Nations if he's taking impeachment seriously.

""Not at all seriously,"" Trump said, denying any wrongdoing and staying impeccably on-message that this whole thing has more to do with Biden.

""We had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""Everybody knows it's just a Democrat witch hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession and now they're bringing this up. The one who has the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do except one problem, I didn't do it.""

Days after dismissing and downplaying a whistleblower's complaint , Trump has now acknowledged he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and CNN has reported that the President pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

But Trump has since tried to obfuscate any wrongdoing on his part and instead try to train the spotlight on Biden.

""Joe Biden and his son are corrupt,"" Trump claimed without offering specifics on Monday, his first day at the United Nations General Assembly, an annual gathering of world leaders in New York.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president).

The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders).

Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers.

In a tweet, Romney, who was his party's presidential nominee in 2012, also said it was ""critical"" for the facts surrounding the call to emerge.

Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange.

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation . That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists.

The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a refusal last week by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during his scheduled appearance Thursday.

The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts and a continuing impeachment investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion.

Pressure to impeach

Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript.

""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of calling on Congress to immediately launch proceedings.

Schiff, who has so far resisted joining other Democrats in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings.

On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior.""

Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""

""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.

White House split on releasing calls

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.

The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things.""

But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""

""We don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump told reporters in describing the call. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) And Monday, sources told CNN that White House officials are considering releasing a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke of ""a grave new chapter in lawlessness.""

Trump's administration has already intervened to keep secret the whistleblower complaint that appears to be related to Ukraine -- thereby blocking the normal process that would inform Congress of the controversy. And in doing so, he has aligned himself more closely with the tragic example of Richard Nixon, who resigned as Congress accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors.

And you would be wrong!

""It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman (Adam) Schiff and Senator (Chuck) Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said from the floor of the Senate on Monday, adding that the ""specific subject"" of the whistleblower complaint filed to to the intelligence community inspector general remains unknown. (It doesn't. Trump has made clear that a) he talked to the Ukrainian President and b) mentioned on that call the idea that Biden and his son, Hunter, might be involved in corrupt activity in the country.)

Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who was once seen as a rare Republican willing to question Trump, had this to say when asked by Vice's Liz Landers if he had a comment on the Trump/Ukraine news: ""You're welcome to talk to James in my office."" And Texas Sen. John Cornyn had this to say about the whistleblower : ""I am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came form somebody that didn't have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire.""

So, yeah. The reason that questions about Trump's behavior throughout this Ukraine drama won't be the final straw in the Republican relationship with Trump is because there will never be a final straw in Republicans' relationship with Trump. When he won the GOP nomination, the vast, vast, vast majority of GOPers simply decided that even though they didn't support him initially and still had LOTS of questions about how he went about things, Trump was channeling their base and the only way to stay alive politically was to support him without question.

""Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a US election, it couldn't be clearer,"" Weld said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""And that's not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It's treason pure and simple.""

""The penalty for treason under the US code is death. That's the only penalty,"" Weld added. ""The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the President if he could work out a plea deal.""

Weld's comments come amid mounting scrutiny of Trump after he acknowledged discussing Biden and his son, Hunter, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

White House officials are now considering releasing a transcript of the call, multiple sources have told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Article Three of the Constitution defines treason as ""levying War against [the US] or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" The president, the Constitution says, ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""

US code states individuals found guilty of treason ""shall suffer death"" or face imprisonment, a fine, and ""shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.""

Weld made the comments in a joint interview alongside two other Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP nomination, former congressmen Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford.

""Donald Trump needs to be impeached. Period,"" Walsh said. ""As Bill Weld just said, he told a foreign leader two months ago to interfere in our 2020 election. He needs to be impeached.""

Sanford, who also served as governor of South Carolina, echoed Weld and Walsh's strong rhetoric.

""I think you know where the three of us are on this larger debate,"" he said.

Earlier this month, all three GOP challengers penned an op-ed in The Washington Post lambasting state Republican leaders and Trump for opting to cancel their 2020 presidential primary elections in a show of support for the President.

""The primary nomination process is the only opportunity for Republicans to have a voice in deciding who will represent our party,"" they said. ""Let those voices be heard."""

The freshman Democrat’s comments came after 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Despite calls from Ocasio-Cortez and Warren, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has taken a more cautious approach, calling impeachment “a divisive approach.”

Pelosi added that Democrats should look at all the facts before deciding to move forward with impeachment proceedings.

The increase in Democrat calls for impeachment comes from an August whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official amid efforts from Democrats to learn more about Trump’s ties with Ukraine. These same Democrats are trying to get ahold of the complaint.

Trump acknowledged that he had talked with the Ukranian president about an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden while speaking with reporters on trips to Texas and Ohio on Saturday.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption– all of the corruption taking place– and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said."

That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.

In other words, this race isn't over by any stretch."

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

A handful of Democrats who have spent Trump's presidency warning against the consequences of a distracting impeachment inquiry have used the latest allegations -- where Trump admitted to discussing his possible 2020 political rival Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- to signal a ""tipping point.""

While most left some wiggle room in their stance on impeachment, Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota issued a statement saying she is ""immediately"" calling for proceedings.

""We must safeguard our electoral process and our very democracy from outside threats. For this reason, the current investigations into corruption must continue. And when there is an abuse of power of this magnitude, it is our responsibility to stand up for what is right. This is why I am calling to open impeachment proceedings -- immediately, fairly, and impartially.""

In a Washington Post op-ed published Monday night, seven freshman Democrats wrote that ""if these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.""

""We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of 'inherent contempt' and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security,"" the op-ed read.

The move by the freshman Democrats -- Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia -- marks a notable escalation from a group of lawmakers who are vulnerable in the 2020 election. Crow had previously called for an impeachment inquiry earlier in the summer, but the other lawmakers were signaling their potential openness for the first time.

Sherrill said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President"" and noted her concern that impeachment would shift focus from her constituents' needs, citing fixes to health care and taxes.

""Quite frankly, in my district, it is not enough to impeach the President. In fact, many people probably won't agree with my decision,"" Sherrill said.

But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts ""crossed a line"" for her and the six other freshmen Democrats.

""I think we all understood the implications of this right away. Many of us, if not all of us, have worked overseas. We've worked with foreign governments. We've worked to protect our national security and democracy, so this was a red line. We coalesced on this very quickly,"" Sherrill said of the group's decision to pen the op-ed.

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the inspector general of the intelligence community in August. The complaint hasn't been shared with lawmakers, despite Democratic calls for the acting director of national intelligence to comply with a legal requirement to do so.

Rep. Vincente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who has thus far resisted calling for Trump's impeachment, told CNN on Monday that he would reconsider his position if the administration does not turn over the whistleblower complaint regarding the President and Ukraine to the House Intelligence Committee this week.

Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday, Gonzalez said if Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, Hunter.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.

Gonzalez reiterated his stance in statement to CNN following the interview, saying he would ""seriously consider joining the calls to open an impeachment inquiry"" if the complaint isn't handed over.

Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota freshman Democrat who has also not embraced impeachment, said Monday that Democrats ""must pursue articles of impeachment and report them to the full House of Representatives for immediate consideration"" if reports about the whistleblower complaint are corroborated.

""This continues a pattern of behavior that is corrupt at best, treasonous at worst, and puts our rule of law at risk,"" Phillips said in a statement. ""Our Constitution transcends any person, politician, or political party, and I call on the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Judiciary Committees to use every legal mechanism possible to obtain all relevant evidence.""

And Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long pushed against pursuing impeachment, separately said on Monday that the complaint could lead to impeachment, calling the situation ""deeply concerning.""

""If fully substantiated, it will be of momentous consequence, including the possibility of initiating impeachment proceedings,"" Lynch said in a statement.

As recently as last month, he was arguing that conducting impeachment proceedings would hand Trump another four years in the White House.

In a news release Monday night, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said she has been reluctant to call for impeachment, but ""these actions regarding the 2020 election are a turning point.""

Impeachment, she said, ""may be the only recourse Congress has"" if Trump is enlisting foreign help in the 2020 election.

Their comments came after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN's Jake Tapper over the weekend that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon"" and impeachment could be ""the only remedy"" equal to the offense.

The controversy surrounding Trump's dealings with Ukraine has added fuel to already-heated discussions among Democrats about whether to pursue impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee is conducting an investigation to determine whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment, but Democratic leaders are divided about the issue.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has thus far resisted calls to launch such proceedings over concern that an impeachment push would be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate and would imperil Democrats' 2020 election chances.

Pelosi, in a letter to all members of Congress over the weekend, said that the standoff could escalate Democrats' ongoing investigation into Trump.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" she wrote.

But some lawmakers say they are hearing from constituents who want to see Democrats take action beyond just more investigation, and soon.

""Phones have been ringing all day with constituents calling to tell me they support impeachment, particularly following the President's corrupt dealings with Ukraine,"" Virginia Rep. Don Beyer wrote on Twitter Monday. ""They are right.""

It's the latest example of how Republicans are extremely reluctant to criticize the leader of their party even in the face of a growing controversy with many outstanding questions.

The tone was set by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, when he opened the chamber floor and blasted Democrats for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known.

McConnell also refused to tell reporters if he believed the formal whistleblower complaint that's being held back by the administration should be made available to Congress or if Trump was wrong to discuss with the Ukrainian President possible investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

""Is it a whistleblower or is it a leaker, I don't know which,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of the GOP leadership and Intelligence Committee, who said the matter may fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice for prosecution, not Congress for oversight.

The facts of whether the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic general election opponent Joe Biden while a US military aid package was on the table are still obscured.

Trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and note that an intelligence community whistleblower who raised the alarm was operating with a second-hand knowledge of Trump's conversations.

But if Trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing US elections, it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours.

It would amount to a situation in which Trump's team, which according to the Mueller report expected to benefit from Russian election meddling in 2016, is now using the power of the presidency to incite collusion ahead of the 2020 election.

That possibility seemed to unlock a shift Sunday in the Democratic position on impeachment. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon."" And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who has been loath to contemplate an impeachment drama -- warned that events might necessitate a ""new stage of investigation.""

Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels, told CNN on Monday morning, ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus.""

Republican senators who have strongly supported Trump were largely silent but Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted Sunday ""it would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and that it is ""critical for the facts to come out.""

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. The then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko said in May that Burisma Holdings, a major energy company, did not violate Ukrainian law by having Hunter Biden on its board and paying him.

Trump's claims that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he investigated a business for which his son served as a board member have previously been found to be false. The prosecutor was seen as corrupt by multiple governments and international institutions, not just the former vice president.

Why pressure by Trump on Ukrainians would matter

Presidents are expected to act in the interests of all Americans and not to use their vast discretion in foreign policy to pursue political vendettas or subvert US democracy. The Founders saw the presidency as a public trust, meaning that its incumbents should not put their personal interests over the national interest. The Ukraine story is so significant because it may have the potential to fall into such grave constitutional territory and could represent an abuse of presidential power.

Trump and his team seemed at odds Sunday over whether to publish the transcript of his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And they went on offense in typical fashion, bending facts and spinning conspiracy theories, obfuscation and hypocrisy.

Trump insisted that he said ""absolutely nothing wrong"" in the call with the Ukrainian president. ""It was perfect,"" he said. Trump often gives the impression that he believes he is not constrained by norms on the limits of power observed by past presidents. In July for instance, he said, falsely, that Article 2 of the Constitution ""allows me to do whatever I want as President.""

Past scrapes like the 2016 Russian election meddling scandal -- and multiple controversies ranging from his insulting behavior toward the late Sen. John McCain to his payments to women who claimed they had affairs with him -- have failed to bring him down. His emergence from each may have taught him a lesson.

Trump says he spoke to Ukrainian President about Biden

Trump on Sunday appeared to add new context to the Ukraine story when he said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president at a time when Kiev was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States. The call with Zelensky took place on July 25. Congress passed the bill in August and the White House lifted a hold on the money in September.

""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said.

CNN has reported that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden's son in a call on July 25, but did not discuss a pending aid package at the time, indicating there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined in the conversation.

The latest developments highlighted Pelosi's reluctance to trigger impeachment proceedings against Trump amid fears of a political backlash. But Schiff, a Pelosi ally, suggested things may be about to change.

""This would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort and not first resort,"" Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""But if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.""

Pelosi and Schiff were in close coordination throughout the weekend talking about the Ukraine whistleblower story and coordinating strategy, a leadership aide confirmed to CNN.

The way that events could force the hands of Democratic leaders became even clearer later on Sunday.

Pelosi hinted at a change of strategy in a message to Democratic colleagues, over half of whom had already backed the idea of impeachment.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi wrote on Sunday.

Democratic reluctance on impeachment

Pelosi has been reluctant to embrace impeachment since Senate Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict the President. There is also no desire to set Trump's political base alight as Democrats try to keep their House majority in 2020.

If Trump's behavior is exposed as corrupt, Democrats may be forced into impeachment hearings -- whatever the long-term political cost.

To do nothing would be to accept that a President can abuse his power by seeking foreign interference in American democracy. Trump would feel validated and emboldened.

The balance between Congress and the Presidency will have been fundamentally altered and there will be few checks and balances left capable of constraining Trump and future presidents.

Inaction might also be politically unsustainable since Democrats might see their own leaders as willing to use the power of a House majority to defend their own presidential front-runner.

Democrats, both freshmen from Trump-won districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations on Monday morning.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

Trump allies hit back

Seeking to fog such questions, Trump's lieutenants went on the offensive on Sunday talk shows using a familiar playbook.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived debunked questions about Biden's conduct.

""I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week.""

""America cannot have our elections interfered with, and if that's what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.""

For the administration to make an argument about electoral interference seems somewhat rich, given that Trump has long rejected evidence that Russia intervened in 2016 to help him.

On ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was no reason to believe Trump pressured Ukraine, though admitted he wasn't on the call in question.

And he argued that Biden's son should not have been allowed to do business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Asked by Jake Tapper Sunday about the glaring inconsistency in this statement since Trump's children continue to work globally on a business from which the President has not fully divested, Mnuchin dodged.

""I don't really want to go into more of these details,"" Mnuchin said.

Both Mnuchin and Pompeo opposed releasing transcripts of Trump's calls, arguing that a President has a right to confidentiality in conversations with foreign leaders.

The administration's efforts to stop acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from releasing the whistleblower report to Congress, and its opposition to releasing a transcript, are only fueling speculation the White House has something to hide. If there was wrongdoing such conduct could equal obstruction of justice, historically an impeachable offense.

Trump, however, said that he hoped they would release the transcript.

Biden, meanwhile, spent the weekend defending himself and trying to turn the scandal to his own advantage in a tight primary race.

""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden said.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Schumer urged Republicans to “fulfill your constitutional duty” by probing the complaint, which is believed to center around President Trump allegedly urging Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s scandals in the Eastern European country.

“In the face of this dire warning and the Trump Administration’s effort to cover it up, the Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution’s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight,” Schumer wrote.

“The Republican Senate’s ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude toward such a serious national security concern is unacceptable and must change,” he added, before calling on McConnell to hold hearings and issue a subpoena for the complaint.

House Intelligence Committee members were briefed last week by Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, about the complaint, though the official would not provide specifics to lawmakers or comply with panel chair Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) demand that he turn over the complaint, due to executive privilege.

Buried in establishment media’s reportage on the complaint is the fact that the so-called whistleblower did not have “direct knowledge of the communications.”

Speaking Sunday to reporters, President Trump said his conversation with Zelensky was “largely congratulatory,” adding that he did mention how he does not want people like Biden and his son contributing to “the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

“When the president speaks to the head of another country, he has to be able to speak to those people and those people don’t want to know that they’re being recorded or that you have a stenographer working,” the president said ahead of a trip to Houston, Texas, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “You don’t want to have to hear that. You can’t do that to a president and you can’t do that to other countries.”

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko has also dismissed the notion of any wrongdoing in President Trump’s called with Zelensky, telling Hromadske, a Ukrainian online broadcast outlet, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

“There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers,” Prystaiko added.

Though there is still much unknown about the so-called complaint, House Democrat leaders such as Schiff, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have suggested the Trump-Zelensky call could be grounds for impeachment.

“If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” Pelosi wrote to lawmakers on Sunday.

Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Schiff (D-CA) said Sunday that impeachment may be “the only remedy” as President Trump confirmed he discussed Biden and corruption with Ukraine’s president.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,” he said.

Schumer calls for hearings ""to determine exactly what prompted the whistleblower to file this urgent complaint,"" and says they should feature testimony from a host of administration officials, including acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

(CNN) President Trump treats many of his official appearances as campaign events. His public engagements often focus on criticizing his perceived political rivals and touting himself, and he even kicked off his last UN General Assembly speech with a personal report card on how much he thinks he has accomplished. He's bashed the UN repeatedly, but he may want to try a different approach this time around.

The UN General Assembly is always a high stakes event for national security, but this year's gathering will take place amid rising tensions with Iran, a nuclearizing North Korea, the degradation of the global nonproliferation agenda, ongoing humanitarian crises and more.

And the UNGA already has a dark cloud hanging over it. As world leaders descend on New York City, they are already well aware of the urgent whistleblower complaint, lodged by a member of the intelligence community, concerning at least one of President Trump's communications with a foreign leader as well as Trump's own admission that he discussed Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, the President said , ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption).""

These world leaders may be convinced Trump is more concerned about his own political standing than the security of the American people. This waters down the credibility of any US national security work as our peers wonder whose interests the President and his team are really serving: America's or Trump's.

Trading places

The United States has often been a champion for promoting the rule of law and anti-corruption around the world, including through the UN. The concept of the rule of law is even embedded in the UN charter -- and through the State Department and other US government entities we have programs focused on advancing it overseas. However, our ability to advance rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives globally takes a direct hit when the President is viewed as a poster child for the kind of actions we're trying to get other countries to stop doing.

President Trump reportedly pressed Ukraine's President Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, a source told CNN . And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that he also asked the Ukrainian government to investigate the former Vice President, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing from either Joe Biden or his son Hunter.

This news only bolsters the idea that the President is abusing his power to engage in self-dealing. Allegations of nepotism, emoluments violations , channeling business to Trump properties and more have already painted a picture of a President doggedly pursuing self-interest. Taken with new allegations of self-dealing and abuses of power, other leaders may now need to include anti-corruption talking points on their agenda when meeting with President Trump.

We have urgent business with Ukraine, including helping them to deter Russian aggression. Instead, because of the President's reported actions, the meeting may be overshadowed by the whistleblower complaint, Giuliani's efforts, and getting the story straight on their last phone call.

Ukraine has already been roped into this domestic US issue. Their Foreign Minister issued a statement saying that Zelensky didn't feel pressured and that Ukraine is an independent state.

Zelensky and his team are trying to walk a fine line between keeping the President happy (they must know his ire has consequences ), without drowning in his political hot water. Fighting Trump's battles is likely not a priority for Zelensky. He has real ones of his own -- including an ongoing armed conflict with Russia -- going on at home.

This dark cloud of potential conflicts of interest and abuse of power will likely carry over into other meetings as well, like the President's meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Polish President Andrzej Duda, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Even before the whistleblower complaint and the administration's decision to freeze security assistance to Ukraine earlier this year, world leaders were aware that Trump is willing to cut off foreign assistance to countries who won't (or can't) do his bidding. The idea that the President relies on explicit or implicit quid pro quos to score political wins has only been bolstered by recent events. Foreign leaders now have good reason to wonder whether incoming Trump requests are campaign 2020 calls or actually have to do with national security.

Fairweather fan

While Trump's bilateral meetings at the UNGA this week will be critical, his approach to the United Nations itself may indicate that he's a fairweather fan of the United Nations.

Even before he assumed office, President Trump had railed against the United Nations, saying it was "" not a friend of democracy ,"" and as President-elect he said the UN was causing problems and would be a waste of time and money if it didn't live up to its potential.

This year, the President may need to turn to the UN for support. While the formal UN agenda includes a host of topics that the President doesn't like -- including climate change and sustainable development -- he's probably going to try to get other member states to focus on what's top of mind for him, like reports that Iran was behind the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after several months of illegal activities in international waters, and a host of other malign activities. Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior will likely be a key topic for Trump in both public and private discussions.

The administration recently rolled out new sanctions against Iran and announced the deployment of more US forces to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But these actions would benefit from UN backing. We've already cut off most transactions with Iran and these unilateral US sanctions probably won't have a lot of bite unless we're willing to punish foreign entities and individuals who violate our new sanctions or the UN passes similar ones. So making a compelling case about Iran's activities at the UNGA may be on top of Trump's to-do list.

Odd man out

While he's seeking to convince his global peers about the threat from Iran, Trump will probably try to water down their focus on another malign actor: North Korea.

North Korea conducted several missile tests over the last few months -- a sign of its advancing arsenal -- and experts say its nuclear stockpile is expanding. Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton said that North Korea's missile tests violate UN Security Council resolutions , but Trump still downplayed the missile tests . His stance on North Korea will likely be at loggerheads with that of our allies at the UN and will add to the general perception that there is no coherence when it comes to Trump's approach to rogue regimes.

Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn.

In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower's complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.

""We will have no choice,"" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report.

During the flight, Pelosi read a Washington Post op-ed from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.

She said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president's actions ""represent an impeachable offense.""

""It will be a big week,"" Pelosi said.

The reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it's still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.

Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even after President Donald Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.

That's why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday's high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump's conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint.

Plus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond -- particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts -- to see if it's time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.

The House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.

""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,"" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening.

'When are Democrats going to get tough?'

The impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.

Democrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday.

""This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?"" Connolly said. ""We are looking weak.""

So far, as many as 137 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according a CNN count -- more than half the caucus and with dozens having joined in the past two months. But that number is still far below a majority of House members and Pelosi has long warned of the political consequences of taking such a step against the Presidents.

Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on ""Newsroom"" Monday, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said if Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.

New subpoena threat

The new comments from Democratic lawmakers Monday comes as three House committees threatened to subpoena the State Department over ""documents the State Department has been withholding in response to a letter the Chairmen sent two weeks ago relating to efforts by the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to solicit the help of a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 Presidential Election."" Three chairmen -- House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings -- authored a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,"" the three chairmen wrote jointly. ""Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.""

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former vice president in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

However, some senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders. At particular issue: White House concern about giving Congress ammunition to demand transcripts of Trump's calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump's acknowledgment that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president has intensified scrutiny on his interactions and decisions on Ukraine.

On Friday CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump remained unclear about the fate of the transcript on Monday, speaking about the Ukraine controversy multiple times during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

""Perhaps you'll see it, perhaps you won't see that, it depends on what we want to do,"" Trump said of the transcript. The President again denied that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens.

""I did not make a statement that, 'You have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" he said.

But Trump again suggested he hoped to release a transcript of his conversation.

""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,"" he said.

More mixed signals

House Democrats have demanded to see the full complaint a whistleblower filed last month with the intelligence community inspector general -- a document the administration, including the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel -- has fought to keep secret. The complaint includes the Ukraine call, a source told CNN, but may not necessarily be limited to that one incident.

Over the weekend, White House officials solicited opinions from outside advisers about whether they should release the transcript of Trump's call with the Zelensky, as well as how advisers think the White House should message it if the transcript was ""embarrassing.""

A person familiar with the discussions said the White House Counsel's Office is currently involved in evaluating whether the transcript should be released and in what form. The source said the release could happen ""soon.""

But Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary, sounded a reluctant note this morning on Fox News.

""I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent. He is willing to do it, I think. But there is a lot of other people, lawyers and such that may have a problem with it. So we will see what happens,"" Grisham said.

Officials are also looking at potential redactions of Zelensky's portion of the conversation.

On Saturday, Trump raised the possibility of releasing a transcript of the call to a ""respected source"" for review.

In March, White House counsel Pat Cipillone sent a letter to Congress saying the administration would not release any conversations Trump has had with foreign leaders, citing longstanding precedent. That letter came in the context of White House efforts to shield Trump's conversations with Putin. But releasing the Zelensky call could undermine the White House's pre-existing efforts to keep those Putin conversations secret, which is one of several concerns inside the White House over putting out details of the call.

'A terrible precedent'

Another concern -- voiced on the Sunday shows by Pompeo and Mnuchin -- is that publishing the call could chill candor when Trump speaks with foreign leaders in the future. Both suggested Trump requires an expectation of privacy in order to conduct diplomacy effectively.

""I think that would be a terrible precedent,"" Mnuchin said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential, and if every time someone for political reasons raised a question, and all of a sudden those conversations were disclosed publicly ... then why would world leaders want to have conversations together?""

Pompeo echoed a similar reservation.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week.""

A number of political advisers have urged the White House to release it, with full knowledge of the diplomatic concerns cited by Mnuchin and Pompeo over the weekend.

""Otherwise, it looks like we're hiding something far more nefarious,"" one person said.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, publicly urged Trump to publish the transcript on Monday and hinted the White House could do so in the days ahead.

""I would just urge the President ... to release as much as possible. And here's what I think -- I think you're going to find (out) more about that phone call in the coming days,"" Graham said during on appearance on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. ""You're going to be surprised about the level of transparency regarding that phone call.""

One senior administration official said there's an understanding inside the White House that the timing of the administration's suspension of the Ukraine aid, which came around the time of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, ""lends to a question of what was going on.""

But this official, like the President, insists there was no quid pro quo.

Trump himself told reporters yesterday while leaving the White House that he wants to release the call. But he later said one way to release the call, given concerns about protecting American interests, would be to ""give it to a respected source.""

He said in Houston on Sunday that if the call was released, people would ""see one of the finest, one of the nicest"" conversations."

Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn.

In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower's complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.

""We will have no choice,"" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report.

During the flight, Pelosi read a Washington Post op-ed from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.

She said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president's actions ""represent an impeachable offense.""

""It will be a big week,"" Pelosi said.

The reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it's still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.

Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even after President Donald Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.

That's why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday's high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump's conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint.

Plus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond -- particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts -- to see if it's time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.

The House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.

""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,"" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening.

'When are Democrats going to get tough?'

The impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.

Democrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday.

""This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?"" Connolly said. ""We are looking weak.""

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.

On Friday, Ratajkowski — who frequently posts pictures of her private jet escapades — tweeted, “The problem is plastic straws it’s corporate greed #globalclimatestrike,” despite the fact that over “90 percent of the planet’s plastic waste comes Asia and Africa” and “straws in the United States account for about 0.03 percent of global plastic pollution,” as Breitbart News reported.

However, as of Monday morning, the tweet was unavailable. It remains unclear what prompted the left-wing activist to delete the message.

As Breitbart News noted, Ratajkowski has demonstrated a stunning ability to put her climate change concerns aside to boast of her excessive air travel on social media. For example, this month, Ratajkowski posted a series of pictures of herself, posing on private jets:

The I Feel Pretty actress is also an advocate of JetSmarter, which some have called the “Uber of air travel.”

“It’s the ‘first global digital marketplace for private aviation’ which makes booking flights on private jets a breeze for carbon footprint producing celebrities like Ratajkowski,” as Breitbart News reported.

This is not the first time a celebrity has demonstrated climate change hypocrisy. Over the summer, many high-profile guests drastically increased their CO2 emissions by flying across the globe to attend the “Google Summer Camp” to discuss climate change.

As Breitbart News reported:

Traditionally held every year at the end of July, the famed Verdura Resort hosts the top-secret gathering, with the three-day summer camp costing the tech giant some $20 million, sources told the Post. Many of the guests, including Obama and DiCaprio — who has his own climate change foundation — have described global warming as the biggest threat to future generations. Forbes reports numerous yachts are currently moored off the beach at Verdura Resort having discharged their passengers; German pharmaceutical titan Udo J. Vetter’s sailing yacht Aquarius, Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg’s sailing yacht EOS, Graeme Hart’s yacht Ulysses with others en route including David Geffen’s yacht Rising Sun, Google’s Eric Schmidt’s yacht Infinity and its support vessel Intrepid, among them. According to Italian press reports, the attendees were also expected to show up in 114 private jets, of which 40 had arrived by Sunday.

Over the weekend, 17 Democrat candidates – most of whom have deemed climate change an emergency – attended the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Iowa Saturday, which featured 10,500 steaks. Clips show the candidates dancing and even playing an active role in grilling steak, despite several of them expressing concern on beef consumption and its role in contributing to the “catastrophe”:

""As soon as I saw that he had recommended it be sent to Congress, that's all I needed to know it was legit,"" said Mary McCord, the senior litigator from Practice at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who worked with Atkinson at the US Attorney's Office and DOJ's National Security Division.

Several officials who acknowledged they are skeptical of the complaint told CNN the IC IG, Michael Atkinson, is a serious professional and that his recommendation gives them pause when they would have been inclined to dismiss the case otherwise.

Atkinson is widely regarded as a career non-partisan with little interest in the public limelight but he currently finds himself at the center of the high profile controversy related to whether the whistleblower complaint

His recommendation that the complaint, which Atkinson says raised allegations of ""urgent concern,"" be shared with lawmakers has fueled the escalating standoff between the director of national intelligence and Congress while Trump has continued to publicly question the whistleblower's motives for speaking out.

But Atkinson has stood by his conclusion that the complaint indeed raises concerns that must be handed over to Congress in accordance with the law, despite clashing with his own boss, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over that determination.

The House Intelligence Committee released a letter from Atkinson last week in which he wrote that he and Maguire, ""are at an impasse"" over that point, marking an unprecedented disagreement between the DNI and IC IG.

""This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday.

Appointed as IC IG by Trump in 2018, Atkinson's long-standing reputation as a straight-shooter with professional integrity has bolstered the legitimacy of the whistleblower complaint despite the President's attempts to paint it as a partisan attack, multiple sources have told CNN.

Credible sense of urgency

Prior to his Senate confirmation to become IC IG in 2018, Atkinson worked for the Justice Department for over 15 years, according to his biography on the ODNI website

From 2002 through 2006, Atkinson worked as a trial attorney in DOJ's Criminal Division, Fraud Section. He then served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2016, where he was the acting chief and deputy chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section.

Some of Atkinson's former colleagues agreed that his credentials as a non-partisan and relative obscurity prior to becoming involved in the whistleblower case lend weight to the seriousness of the complaint.

Atkinson brought several major cases to the US Attorney's Office that were ""the result of thorough, quiet investigation,"" according to McCord, who served as the acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ from 2016 to 2017 and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division from 2014 to 2016.

That quiet, non-partisan approach to his work is why McCord believed he would be a good fit for the IC IG role.

""The mere fact he was not on anyone's radar is points to the fact that his sense of urgency is credible,"" she said. ""People don't know who he is and that's because he does his job. He's the IG and most of that work is not in the public sphere.""

""You would not know which political party he favors by working with him. I worked with him for years. That's the other reason I feel he's so credible in this space,"" McCord added.

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, told CNN that Atkinson is ""someone who is very deliberate, thoughtful and tries to carefully review facts ... not someone who seeks attention.""

""So if he is in a situation where something needed to be referred that's because it was his best and informed view of what the law required,"" he said.

Not backing down?

McCord told CNN that she believes Atkinson feels strongly that the complaint needs to be reported to Congress but is also trying to respect the hierarchy in place, which includes the DNI.

During a closed-door briefing with Schiff's committee on Thursday, Atkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower's concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

The inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details.

Although the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing.

According to one source, Atkinson referenced ""a sequence of events"" and ""alleged actions"" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim.

The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with a July call between Trump and Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

While Trump and some Congressional Republicans have attempted to downplay concerns surrounding the complaint, McCord told CNN that she does not see Atkinson backing down from his position.

""If he got to a position where he saw resigning as the only alternative, he would do it ... but there is a lot of space between now and that point,"" McCord added, noting that Maguire is still expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday."

(CNN) After a brief cessation of hostilities against the United States' intelligence and law enforcement community, President Donald Trump is once again gearing up to do battle. He is dusting off his old playbook and employing many of the same tactics he relied on to counter past allegations of wrongdoing.

The question this week is whether the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, abused the power of the executive office to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, making him a political rival of the President.

Reports of Trump's conversations with the Ukrainian president come as a whistleblower from the intelligence community has filed an official complaint with the inspector general related to the call, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN.

The inspector general concluded that the whistleblower complaint was ""credible"" and ""urgent"" — a level of seriousness that requires the Justice Department to notify Congress. The IG followed this protocol by forwarding the whistleblower's report to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, who has refused to share it with Congress. On Monday, Trump laid into the government whistleblower, questioning the person's nationality and suggested that it is anti-American to report suspected abuses by a president.

In short, the executive branch is blocking the whistleblower's information from getting to Congress, even though the law is clear that such notification is mandatory in cases of this sort. For his part, the IG says the executive branch is keeping him from doing his job.

Only two months have passed since Special Counsel Robert Mueller appeared before Congress, concluding a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Although many people have gone to prison over charges stemming from the special counsel's probe , no one was ultimately charged with conspiracy with Russia, despite at least one documented attempt by Team Trump to accept political dirt from a foreign adversary.

During the course of Mueller's investigation, the President and his allies engaged in a full-throated assault on the institutions of power that were investigating Trump's inner circle, working to discredit the men and women charged with safeguarding America against foreign threats.

As I write in my new book, ""Crossfire Hurricane: Inside Donald Trump's War on the FBI,"" the President blamed investigators for conducting a ""witch hunt,"" and for being ""deep state"" operatives working to undermine his presidency. Without evidence, he claimed the FBI had inserted a ""spy"" into his campaign for sinister political purposes and castigated former President Barack Obama for allegedly ordering the wiretapping of Trump Tower.

Many national security experts, including me, believe Trump's goal in these baseless attacks was to help soften the blow of whatever might eventually come from Mueller's findings.

In the latest scandal, involving Trump's dealings with Ukraine, the President is drawing from the same playbook he used in his earlier attacks against the intelligence community: initially claim no knowledge of allegations of wrongdoing, eventually deny those allegations, claim that whatever was originally being described was actually innocent, and then wage war against those doing the investigating.

During the Russia investigation, Trump and his allies insisted that Mueller and his team were partisan operatives with an agenda, even though the key players involved in that case -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director James Comey, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and even Mueller himself -- were all Republicans

President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal, publicly blasting the whistleblower as a "" partisan ,"" even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The president denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been ""beautiful."" And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as "" the Ukraine witch hunt .""

As I have tried to warn the public ever since Trump's initial attacks on the FBI and Justice Department during the Russia probe, the President's efforts to undermine our institutions of justice pose real consequences to public safety. For example, FBI agents and intelligence officers rely on the public to help gather leads and serve as informants. A lack of public trust might mean fewer people will come forward to help guard against threats.

Furthermore, US intelligence agencies have the life-and-death responsibility of advising policymakers on serious threats to US national security. Political attacks on these agencies' credibility will only serve to undermine their effectiveness in the eyes of lawmakers and the public they serve. If any president destroys that precious trust with the American people for nefarious political purposes, that president risks undermining democracy.

Trump may be lashing out because he has been backed into a corner, but publicly degrading people inside the intelligence community because their good-faith efforts threaten his political survival is no excuse for the war he wages.

As I write in my book, we have seen real intelligence abuses in the past. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and CIA engaged in gross violations of civil liberties in the name of national security. Innocent Americans were wiretapped without court authorization and spied on, as intelligence bureaus sought to determine their national and political allegiances.

What followed was systematic and wholesale reformative change by lawmakers once these abuses came to light. Congress passed new laws rein in the intelligence community and ensure effective oversight by the legislative branch. The distrust in intelligence and law enforcement in the wake of those scandals has taken decades to reverse.

If President Trump is successful at convincing his base that the intelligence community today is still untrustworthy, he will succeed in undermining these critical institutions in a way that might take a generation to repair."

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) In 2015, Corey Lewandowski was a low-profile political operative. Sean Spicer was a spokesman and strategist for the Republican National Committee. Neither looked likely to star on national TV.

Then along came Donald Trump, who gave both prominent jobs.

And last week, former White House Press Secretary Spicer was twirling in a lime-green ruffled shirt, dancing with the stars. And former Trump campaign manager Lewandowski, defiant in a red tie and jacket, was tangling with and frustrating the House Judiciary Committee's Democrats in a hearing that many could only label absurd.

Spicer's much-hyped re-emergence was not okay, wrote, and she wasn't referring to his dance moves. ""Sean Spicer's entire claim to fame (or infamy) comes from lying for a president who uses his office to lie, to side with dictators, to defend men who abuse women and work for him, to separate families, to stand up for white nationalism and much, much worse. Spicer lied for a liar for a living.

Lewandowski, who's considering a run for a US Senate seat in New Hampshire, got an equally bad review from legal analyst: "" Lewandowski was a truly horrible witness. His demeanor was the stuff of a trial lawyer's nightmares. He was angry, combative, sarcastic, and more intent on getting off personal insults and pumping up his impending Senate campaign than actually answering questions or getting Congress or the public any closer to truth.""

Harry Litman warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue Writing about the Lewandowski hearing in the Washington Post,warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue to distort and darken our politics long after he himself has left the scene .""

Then there's Rudy Giuliani.

Michael D'Antonio, "" The former New York City mayor actually had a national reputation before his immersion in Trumpworld, but has added a new cast to it. In a contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo about an intelligence whistleblower allegation, wrote, "" Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog...both denied and confirmed that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden."" (There's no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.)

David Andelman, raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin In a July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly suggested working with Giuliani on such an investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Zelensky may have a lot to gain from good relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. That, wrote, raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away?""

Frida Ghitis asked, ""What exactly could President Donald Trump have done that...drove a US intelligence official to file a formal whistleblower complaint over communications between Trump and an unidentified foreign leader...?"" She added, ""we have encountered another secret in a presidency that has been defined by obfuscation and falsehoods... The Ukraine matter seemed to be at the heart of the striking new fissure in Trump's relationship with intelligence agencies.asked, ""What exactly could President Donald Trump have done that...drove a US intelligence official to file a formal whistleblower complaint over communications between Trump and an unidentified foreign leader...?"" She added, ""we have encountered another secret in a presidency that has been defined by obfuscation and falsehoods... what is Trump hiding?

Julian Zelizer. Now, ""Trump has the power of the presidency behind him. With that power comes This could be seen as a warning to Trump's 2020 political rivals. In fact, Democrats should be ready for a race unlike anything they've seen before, wrote. Now, ""Trump has the power of the presidency behind him. With that power comes the potential for the administration to unleash damaging investigations in the middle of the campaign that will put the Democrats on defense.""

The A team is long gone

Peter Bergen. Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed. Now that generals James Mattis, John Kelly and H.R. McMaster have left the administration, along with CEOs Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson, the President has ""surrounded himself with yes-men and is running his Cabinet like he used to run his real estate company -- as a one-man show surrounded by flunkies ,"" wrote. Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed.

One of the first things on O'Brien's agenda is how to respond to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, which the Trump administration blamed on Iran.

Trump and his team have said many times that the President was willing to meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions -- but last Sunday Trump tweeted that was ""fake news."" It must be ""amnesia,"" Bergen noted. "" Trump's posturing back and forth between aggression and conciliation might work for a real estate deal in Manhattan, but it's quite confusing and the stakes are also much higher when you are dealing with the complex calculations of a major regional power such as Iran.""

Kavanaugh redux

The controversy over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh resurfaced in a big way with the publication of a piece in the New York Times opinion section drawing on a new book by two of the newspaper's reporters. There was something for all sides to focus on.

Jill Filipovic wrote, ""explores and corroborates previously under-reported claims by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that when she was a student, Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face as a joke. According to news reports, the FBI never fully investigated her claims, nor interviewed the people who reached out to them to corroborate.

Thanks to constraints put in place by the White House, sources told CNN, the FBI also never interviewed Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor Kavanaugh himself. The 'investigation' was a sham, and the Trump administration made it that way .""

The Times came in for withering criticism for its handling of the piece, since -- while it described an additional allegation against Kavanaugh -- it failed to point out that the woman allegedly involved did not remember the incident, according to her friends, and declined to speak to reporters (The Times added an editor's note with those points after the piece was originally published).

Kathleen Parker wrote, ""The recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M.

Marc Thiessen welcomed the call by some Democrats to impeach Kavanaugh: ""As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.

Elie Honig blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations. That's definitely not its role, wrote Honig. Still, the calls for impeachment are futile: "" blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations. That's definitely not its role, wrote Honig. Still, the calls for impeachment are futile: "" Kavanaugh almost certainly is not going anywhere ...

The short SNL career of Shane Gillis

Days after Saturday Night Live announced that comedian Shane Gillis would be joining its cast, the show fired him for what it called his past ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable"" remarks. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang had waded into the controversy, saying that it would be a mistake to dismiss Gillis for his 2018 podcast comments, which included anti-Asian slurs.

An 'imposter'?

Michael Bociurkiw. ""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year -- In the midst of a challenging election campaign, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to try to explain why he wore brownface or blackface at least three times.

""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year -- is certainly not the way Trudeau wants to be seen.

Janaya Khan suggested that, for Trudeau, ""blackface is a mere obstacle to overcome in his campaign run after receiving rebukes this week for darkening his face several times in the past.

Be nice to the coral reefs

The storms that have devastated the Bahamas are a reminder of the fragility of coastlines. Marine scientist Michael Beck wrote that endangered coral reefs are much more than a tourist attraction. They ""act as submerged breakwaters, they 'break' waves and protect communities and wetlands that further block waves and storm surge. ...coral reefs dampen more than 97% of waves before they reach coastlines. Losing just one meter from the top of a reef allows an exponential increase in the wave energy that passes through to the shore. This would lead to a doubling in the cost of flooding during storms for coral reef coastlines in more than 60 countries around the world.""

Beck noted, ""Storms have shaped our shorelines for millennia, and for most of that time our reefs and wetlands stood as guardians against those storms. Without them, we have only ourselves .""

For just one September week each year, everyone from kings, presidents and prime ministers on down to food tasters fly in to New York City and jam into the United Nations headquarters, in what has become a cliched joke about "" diplomatic speed dating ."" But there's nothing funny about the top priority at this 74th year of UNGA year, which is the world's climate emergency.

The United Nations Climate Summit

The UN has arranged a special Climate Action summit on Monday September 23, before the formal speeches given by heads of state and governments that normally draw the most attention. Breaking with tradition, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told country leaders not to come to the podium Monday without ""concrete and transformative plans"" to halt rising global temperatures, achieve carbon neutrality and cut carbon emissions by 45 percent. VIPs with proposals have been told they have just three minutes to speak.

How concrete the results of the summit will actually be is unclear. The UN doesn't have a global climate army to roam the planet stopping pollution, so it's up to the 193 nations of the UN to take action. What the UN will actually do is what some feel the organization sadly does best: collecting the speeches and other environmental brainstorms in a report.

The aim is to pressure world leaders to do more, as the climate emergency worsens. Some have made it a top priority -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be in town for the climate summit, even though she's skipping the rest of the week. In contrast, US President Donald Trump will be in town, but he's skipping the climate summit -- instead hosting a session on religious persecution in the same building. Trump has previously avoided international meetings on climate.

Let the General Debate begin

The so-called ""general debate"" begins on Tuesday September 24, and the first country to speak is Brazil, by longstanding tradition. It'll be the debut UNGA appearance of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who recently vowed to attend even if in a wheelchair, following recent surgery. Expect fireworks: After high global concern over massive fires and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon , the pro-business Bolsonaro is likely to take climate advocates head-on. He has already promised a ""speech that is different from those that came before"".

Following him will be Donald Trump, who has stuck to the teleprompter previously, and last year drew laughter from delegates while praising his own administration.

The volume of Trump's appearances and his unpredictability have dominated the past two years of Trump at the General Assembly. Last year, he shocked the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister by accusing Beijing of interfering in US elections while both men sat at the Security Council table.

Trump was also the first US President to enter the building and take just a few steps before stopping in front of cameras and shouting reporters, to answer hot topic questions for three days. ""He completely sucked the oxygen out of UNGA,"" Richard Gowan, UN Director at the International Crisis Center says.

The elephant in the secretariat

A senior UN official stated, ""tensions in the Gulf are going to be the backdrop to a lot of events and meetings."" Which leads us to the biggest question on the eve of UNGA: Will President Trump meet Iranian President Rouhani?

‎Nothing is planned between the two leaders, though both will be in the UN building amid the parade of delegations. The threats and rhetoric lobbed by both sides have been fierce. The US imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday before the high-level week begins, and the Iranians say they don't need to talk.

It looks like ""a zero chance for a meeting,"" says Gowan. ""Instead of a diplomatic breakthrough, we're likely to see a war of words."" The UN is meant to be a neutral ground for dueling sides to have dialogue, and chance face-to-face encounters are exactly what this international forum is good for. In 2000, then-US President Clinton and then Cuban President Fidel Castro suddenly stopped briefly for each other in a hallway, when relations between the nations were running cold. There is still a debate whether a handshake took place

Who's coming to UNGA?

As of Friday, 91 heads of state had committed to attend. French President Macron will be in New York offering an expanded French leadership role as a global mediator, as the Trump administration pulls the US back from international forums.

‎With significant angst at home over the UK's planned withdrawal from Europe, Boris Johnson will make his first UNGA appearance in his role as prime minister. Brexit talks are scheduled with Ireland's leader and others.

And Indian leader Narendra Modi and Pakistan's leader Imran Khan are both attending and speaking in the General Assembly. No talks are scheduled between them for now, as tensions remain high over India's treatment of Kashmir, a disputed territory.

And of fresh interest to American audiences will be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who debuts at UNGA right in the middle of a growing controversy: The US Congress wants to know if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son , who had business ties in the country. Biden, of course, is one of the main contenders for the US Democratic primary and could end up challenging Trump for the presidency next year.

There are also UN meetings big and small on Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, and Myanmar. Apart from marathon hours of speeches, consider this: 630 meetings have been requested. The UN defines a meeting as a gathering of 15 or more people held within the UN for a maximum of three hours.

There are ""no less challenges than last year"" affecting geopolitics around the world, said British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce. Expect demonstrators near the UN all day -- though the targets of their anger may not even see them through their tinted limousine windows as they rush to the UN, sirens sometimes wailing.

The list of leaders who will not appear this year is also interesting: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping rarely attend, and will not be present this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has canceled, amid a post-election muddle back home. Netanyahu, a former UN Ambassador, relishes his General Assembly speeches -- often with props of charts and diagrams -- and he has previously made for must-see TV in between lengthy boring speeches by others.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been listed as a speaker, but is no longer coming in the wake of multiple revelations of black- and brownface photos that surfaced from his past, just before national elections.

President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has sent his regards but will not leave his turmoil-filled nation. His rival for the Venezuelan presidency -- National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, whose presidential authority has been acknowledged by more than 50 countries, including the US -- is unlikely to show but representatives will push the UN for future recognition of Guaido's claim to power.

Although the immediate premises of the United Nations are international ground, the United States is still the host. According to the ""host country"" agreement, visitors traveling for official UN business are not supposed to be barred, and there was once a time when the US would impose a generous 25-mile radius cordon on international visitors it didn't like.

But this year, the US is not holding back. In addition to the movement restrictions on Iran's Zarif, two Cuban diplomats living in New York who had planned to participate in UNGA were ordered expelled by the Trump administration, in a surprise Thursday announcement. And the remaining diplomats at the Cuban mission face the toughest restrictions among all countries: They're not allowed to leave the narrow island of Manhattan.

And with all the traffic and security blockades, New Yorkers and tourists ‎too may feel no one can get off the island during this madhouse week."

Entirely missing from the brazen fundraising email is the larger context of the story, which spotlights significant questions about Biden’s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period where his son, Hunter Biden, received $50,000 a month from a natural gas company there.

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

None of that was mentioned in the Biden campaign’s fundraising email, sent under the subject line of “about Ukraine.”

“Eight. That’s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family,” the email complains.

The missive continues:

This sort of behavior tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump and the people around him. Every day he is in office, he does something to cheapen and debase the presidency. But it also tells you what he’s worried about. If I’m our Democratic nominee, we will make sure he’s a one term president. It won’t be easy. But I know, with your help, we will beat Trump. Please, I need you with me at this critical moment. Chip in to my campaign tonight.

The email presents donation options from $5 to $250 and another option for “other”, linking to the ActBlue donation site.

The message to potential supporters, signed by Biden, concludes: “Every individual donation to our campaign tonight sends a message to Donald Trump, the Russians who interfered with our elections in 2016 and almost certainly will again, and everyone else that you know we will win the battle for the soul of our nation.”

A second campaign email, titled, “disgusting,” used similar language and also utilized the Ukraine allegations to ask for donations.

Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden during the call with Zelensky but said that nothing inappropriate was done. “No quid pro quo, there was nothing,” Trump commented to reporters on the White House South Lawn. “It was a perfect conversation.”

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he’s going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation.”

Biden, meanwhile, boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

Yoshiko M. Herrera, a Russia and Eurasian policy expert from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was quoted by the Washington Post saying that Biden’s position was “a conflict of interest even if it doesn’t break any laws.”

“Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,” Herrera stated. “Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.”

A New York Times editorial opined that Hunter Biden’s role in the board of Burisma undermined his father’s credibility in Ukraine issues.

The newspaper stated:

Sadly, the credibility of Mr. Biden’s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices. A spokesman for the son, Hunter Biden, argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance. That may be so. But Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine. It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father’s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.

The former vice president told reporters during a campaign appearance in Iowa on Saturday that he denied ever having discussed his son’s position on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas company.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily told reporters, before accusing President Donald Trump of abusing his power by urging the Ukrainian government to investigate the matter.

The former vice president’s claim, however, is contradicted by Hunter Biden’s own words on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do'” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

The contradicting stories between father and son only underscore the multiple unanswered questions already plaguing the situation. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden was asked to join the Bursima board of directors in April 2014, despite not having any experience with Ukraine or the energy industry. Even more concerning to ethics watchdogs is the fact that at the same time Hunter Biden was tapped for the $83,000 a month job, his father was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

As Breitbart’s contributing editor Peter Schweizer noted in his book on the scandal, Hunter Biden joined Burisma at time when the company was seen as actively courting western leaders after its business practices came under scrutiny. The same month Hunter Biden joined the group, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

The former vice president became entangled in the matter when he pushed the government of Ukraine to fire the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the company and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing in 2016. Officially, Joe Biden claimed his threat to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. loans to Ukraine came from then-President Barack Obama, who was worried Shokin had lost credibility with western leaders. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zchlovesky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Despite the shadowy entanglements that seem suggest a conflict of interest, neither Joe Biden nor his son have been willing to address the topic until earlier this week when news broke that Trump had requested Ukrainian authorities to probe the matter. The president defended his decision on Sunday, pointing out there were too many unanswered questions, especially given the Ukraine’s long history of public corruption.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,” Trump told reporters before departing the White House for Houston, Texas.

Trump added that Joe and Hunter Biden had damaged their credibility by contradicting each other.

“This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son,” the president said. “Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said long before that he did speak to his son. So he lied again.”"

Jim Himes (D-CT) on Monday.

“I mean extorting a foreign leader for the purposes of getting that leader to do your political work to try to find dirt on your opponent is extortion,” Himes said during an interview on CNN’s New Day.

“Of course, it’s an impeachable offense,” he concluded.

On Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) echoed Himes’ statement in a tweet, stating it would be “troubling” if the president were to request that Zelensky investigate Biden.

“If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” he wrote.

Himes and Romney’s comments come after a whistleblower alleged in a Wall Street Journal report that the president urged Zelensky during a July phone call to look into Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, and his business dealings in Ukraine.

The report stated:

“He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know” whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said. Mr. Trump didn’t mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, said this person, who didn’t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on an investigation.

However, congressional Republicans recently defended President Trump against the accusations.

“It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Saturday. “Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out — Whoa, different story! This seems to be the same kind of deal.”

On Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, president of the Government Accountability Institute, Peter Schweizer, said the media are trying to make it look like a Biden scandal is actually a Trump scandal.

Schweizer commented:

What’s interesting about this is that Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas or anything like that, but of course his father, the vice president at the time, was the point person on U.S. policy towards Ukraine, and the money we’re talking about here is eye-popping. Hunter Biden was getting $83,000 a month from this Ukrainian energy company where he had no background.

“So the immediate question becomes, he’s not selling his expertise — because he has none in this field — what is he getting paid for?” he concluded."

Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, discussed the mounting controversy involving former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukraine.

Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo he saw it as the end of the elder Biden’s 2020 presidential bid.

“I mean, look, there’s a lot. Look, the left knows that Biden’s son is a problem for him,” he said. “This is why, when Hillary Clinton was running, these stories first originated — first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure that Biden didn’t get in the race.”

“So, now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme,” Nunes continued. “Maybe there really is — this whistle-blower is not a partisan. I mean, we want to — we want to hear from that whistle-blower. But it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And this — like I said, I think this is probably the end of Biden’s campaign.”

“End of his campaign?” Bartiromo replied.

“I really do. I don’t think — I mean, not that he’s — he’s still formidable,” Nunes answered. “He still has a bloc of support. But if you look, his lead is basically down to zero. If you look at what happened in Iowa now, it looks like Elizabeth Warren is in the lead.”

Trump’s opponents have cried “quid pro quo” for Trump insisting on information regarding the younger Biden in exchange for foreign aid designated for Ukraine.

“I don’t know that this is the way it went, but my guess is, ‘You guys want your $250 million? OK, send us the Biden file on how all that money went out of there and what was going on in there, what that was all about, and you got yourselves a deal,'” he said. “That is called politics.”

“That is called a quid pro quo,” Clift said.

“What do you think happens every day in this city?” Buchanan said. “[L]yndon Johnson — you want a dam out there in Idaho, you better vote for the war.”

According to Buchanan, this appeared to be the latest chapter in the “Deep State-media alliance” going against Trump.

“Behind this all is what?” Buchanan said. “It is the Deep State-media alliance in this city, which is resisting and attempting to overthrow the government the American people have imposed upon them. Issue after issue it is the same thing and involves these two warring factions in this city.”

He predicted this would backfire on Biden’s candidacy because it would raise questions about Biden’s son.

“Let me tell you who is going to be the loser here: It’s going to be Joe Biden because all this stuff — if it goes to the Hill, people are going to say, ‘What is he talking about, Biden and Ukraine?

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

“This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said long before that he did speak to his son. So he lied again.”

The president spoke to reporters as he left the White House on Sunday for a visit to Houston, Texas, for a rally with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Trump campaign highlighted on Saturday Biden’s claim that he had “never” spoken to his son Hunter about his business interests overseas. Hunter, however, admitted in an interview in July that he spoke “just once” to his father about his business in Ukraine.

The president ripped Biden’s son Hunter for accepting a board position at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, earning as much as $83,000 a month while his father was leading foreign relations with the country as vice president.

“The son, he knew nothing, the son is a stiff, he knew nothing,” Trump said. “And he’s making hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, and he did the same thing in Ukraine, he knows nothing.”

Trump said that he “wasn’t looking to hurt Biden” despite possibly running against him for president but criticized Biden for threatening to cut aid from Ukraine if they did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma Holdings.

“He said a very foolish thing,” Trump said, referring to Biden.

Hunter Biden’s role with the Ukrainian energy firm and his deals with China were exposed in Peter Schweizer’s bestselling book Secret Empires.

In recent weeks, the establishment media has focused on Trump’s phone calls with the Ukrainian president, reportedly asking the government on multiple occasions to investigate Biden.

But Trump has insisted that his conversations with the Ukrainian president were not bad, even appearing willing to release the transcript.

“We had a very great conversation, very straight, very honest conversation,” he said. “I hope they can put it out.”"

Graham said, “Joe Biden said everybody has looked at this and found nothing. Who is everybody? Nobody’s looked at the Ukraine and the Bidens, nobody’s looked at the role that Ukraine played in 2016 election. Do you think the media in America would really look at it and report on it if there was something bad for the Bidens or they unduly interfered in the 2016 election?”

“So here’s what I’m calling for, I’m calling for somebody in the Justice Department to look at all things Ukraine, we’ve looked at all things Russia and Trump — his family, everything about his family, every transaction between the Trump campaign and Russia, now it’s time to see whether or not the Ukrainians released information regarding Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign manager,” he continued. “What relationships if any, did the Biden world have with the Ukraine, what role if any, did the Ukraine play in 2016 election. So nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping that the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection.”

Weld said “it couldn’t be clearer” that what Trump did was “treason pure and simple” because Joe Biden is a presidential candidate.

“Well, obviously, canceling primaries undermines democratic institutions and democratic elections, but that’s far from the deepest high crime the president has committed here,” Weld told host Joe Scarborough. “He’s now acknowledged that in a single phone call right after he suspended $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, he called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden, who the president thinks is going to be running against him.”

“Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,” he continued. “It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions — that is treason. It’s treason pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty. The penalty on the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.”

Mark Meadows (R-NC) dismissed allegations from a so-called whistleblower claiming President Donald Trump used the power of his office to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden.

Meadows said he had been following the storyline since May and categorized it as a hoax and deemed the whistleblower as illegitimate.

Partial transcript as follows:

PIRRO: Wow. So let’s talk about all this with Republican Congressman Mark Meadows, who joins me now live. Okay, Congressman, so the issue seems to be that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter’s business in the Ukraine, where it’s estimated he made millions in a business with which he had no expertise or training.

So when he is asked and the initial part of that sound, you know, whether or not he talked to his son about doing business in the Ukraine? The answer is no. His own son answered in a “New Yorker” piece, and I think we have a full screen of it, and he said that he had spoken to his father, as Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma, which was that company with him just once. “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing.’ And I said, I do.”

So right on its face, Joe Biden either didn’t recollect or intentionally misled or lied by saying he never spoke to his son about the Ukraine and the business there.

But more significant, the interview where Joe Biden kind of takes a victory lap and says, hey, look, I got the prosecutor fired, because I was withholding billions from Ukraine. What’s your take on that?

REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, my take on that is exactly the kind of thing that they’ve been accusing President Trump of all along. Can you imagine if the prosecutor in Ukraine, if his name was Bob Mueller, what would have happened? Oh, my gosh, I mean, everything would have gone — I want to talk about Ukraine.

You know, the Democrats have really walked into it, because I can tell you that the investigation with regards to Joe Biden’s son, and also the investigation in terms of other D.N.C. operatives working in the Ukraine, happened months ago. We’ve been following this. I’ve been working on this since back in May. So I can tell you this is just not a Russian hoax. This is a Ukrainian hoax, and it’s not even by a legitimate whistleblower.

I mean, there’s been reports, Judge out there that actually the whistleblower didn’t learn about any of this on the job. Actually, it was hearsay. And so when you start to look at the bottom line of all of this is, one, it does need to be investigated. And so I’m calling on my Democratic colleagues, let’s look at it. And I think at the end of the day, Joe Biden will be the one that is left with egg on his face.

PIRRO: All right. So while we talk about the Democrats trying to get information of this whistleblower, and going after the President. It appears that the Democrats may be hoisted on their own petard, given the fact that if you want to talk about Ukraine, if that, indeed, is the conversation that the whistleblower is talking about, there is nothing that is more corrupt than withholding money, in an effort to get a prosecutor to drop an investigation.

And my sources are telling me that not only did he not give that money, Joe Biden, our taxpayer money until the prosecutor was fired, but he had a hand in saying who the second prosecutor was.

So let me ask you this. If the President — and Rudy Giuliani has talked about this, if the President had a conversation into whether or not Joe Biden leveraged American money to stop the Ukrainian investigation, wouldn’t that be a legitimate ask, as long as there is no mention of money? No quid pro quo? No direction as to how it should end up? Doesn’t the President have a right to ask that question?

MEADOWS: Well, he certainly has the right to ask that question. As long as he doesn’t do what Joe Biden did, which says we’re going to hold some money unless you have a particular type of action.

You know, listen, there have been rumors about this before for a long time, obviously, Joe Biden is even bragging about the fact that he used leverage on American taxpayer dollars. But more importantly than that, when we start to see the connection with Ukraine, and what we have now is a new government in Ukraine. So all of a sudden, the protections are falling apart.

The President is right to ask about it. Certainly, if he did, you know —

PIRRO: He did, right.

MEADOWS: Here’s the thing is, you know, we don’t even know what the conversation was all about. And I believe, in fact, I have a strong belief and informed belief that indeed, nothing inappropriate happened. And I can tell you here tonight, that what we’re going to do is get to the bottom of it.

You know, there’s another person, Judge and I know that perhaps we’re not prepared to go here. But there was also a D.N.C. operative, Miss Chalupa that was paid in 2016 dollars to work with Ukraine. And you know what they said that she was doing, working on a women’s outreach in Ukraine.

Well, maybe that’s why Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin and lost Pennsylvania, because they were working on women’s outreach in a foreign country.

PIRRO: But you know what? This is eerily like Russia, when they want to accuse the President — and they are starting to do that — of doing something wrong with the Ukraine, it’s like a boomerang. It comes back and it hits them.

Again, Hillary with the Ukraine, Joe Biden and his son. His son had no expertise in energy making millions. And then in China, the reports are, he made a billion dollars working in China. The Chinese are not stupid. They are not stupid people, and for them to pay that kind of money.

And in fact, I was reading in “The New Yorker” article that there was an individual that Joe Biden — Hunter Biden, the son was involved with, who wanted to meet Joe Biden. And then Hunter went with his father and Joe Biden, and introduced his father, the Vice President to this Asian partner, who ultimately was arrested for corruption, and the partner’s associate was arrested for corruption.

I mean, this is dirty, dirty, dirty. And in the end, I believe that when everything comes up, you know that if Biden did play a central role in the energy policy in the Ukraine, and he is not going to try to turn this around on Donald Trump, that’s the biggest mistake of his life right now.

MEADOWS: Well, a Judge, here is the interesting thing is, I don’t want to falsely accuse anybody of improper behavior. But what we do know is Adam Schiff, and a lot of his Democratic colleagues continue to spin a narrative over and over again, of which they’re guilty of.

You know, they’ll accuse the President of colluding with Russia. Well, the only people that actually worked with the Russians was the D.N.C. and the Clinton campaign, which did it.

I would think at the end of the day, the only people that actually worked with the Ukrainians is that same group, the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and I think you’ll see that, so I welcome us looking at it hopefully Adam Schiff and I can bring in and subpoena some people to really get to the bottom of this, because at the end of the day, it will not be pretty for them.

PIRRO: You know, it’s amazing. The week started out with the left’s plot against the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh and then we’re ending up with another plot against President Trump. Nothing much changes in Washington, does it?

MEADOWS: Well, they keep doing it. You know, they’re trying to throw every accusation at the President and his team as much as they possibly can because they really have nothing.

And they think if they keep going one after another after another, that eventually the American people will side with them. The exact opposite is happening. The exact opposite is happening.

PIRRO: I agree. We’ll see. We’ll see. Congressman Mark Meadows. Thanks so much for being with us this evening.

MEADOWS: Thank you, Judge."

Kerry said, “Well, first of all it’s entirely inappropriate for the president’s personal attorney to be involved in another country trying to find dirt on a presidential candidate, number one. Number two, what President Trump has done is —if he has done it — and the way the move whether he’s done it is release the transcript of that conversation. That’s how you get to the bottom of this. But there is just, you know, for the president of the United States to be leveraging American foreign policy, hocking it, extorting the leader of another country if that’s what has happened is unprecedented, and the last time the president did, that Richard Nixon, the Republican Party stood up and held him accountable for the abuse of power.”

“This Republican Party today is running for cover and actually inadvertently supporting a cover-up if what is alleged is true,” he said. “The only way to get at it is release the transcript. Let everybody see what the president said. If he leveraged American foreign policy and foreign aid to get a president of another country to be the opposition research arm of his campaign, that is a fundamental, profound, and deeply disturbing abuse of power.”

Bernstein said, “Well, I think the first thing is to find out exactly what has happened here. And if the reporting of Shane Harris and The Wall Street Journal is accurate and it seems to be it clearly moves toward a grievance abuse of power by the president of the United States.”

He added, “I keep getting asked are there echoes of Watergate in this? And there are in the following ways, Watergate was an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the democratic electoral process in the United States our basis of democracy by trying through political espionage and sabotage to nominate through political dirty tricks and misinformation its weakest candidate, George McGovern instead of its strongest candidate, Senator Edmund Muskie who Nixon didn’t want to run against.”

“And something in the same thing seems to be happening here, where Biden who Trump and his people said they fear the most in terms of being an opponent has been an object of these perhaps dirty tricks and abuses of power,” Bernstein continued. “One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a big offense if this is what happened, and it seems to be.”

“This violation is about our national security. The Inspector General determined that the matter is ‘urgent’ and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday.

“If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” she continued.

According to an anonymous complaint revealed in reports last week, President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s son — Hunter Biden — and his business dealings in the eastern European country. However, according to CNN, the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications,” citing an official with knowledge of the matter.

On Sunday, Trump said his conversation with Zelensky was “largely congratulatory,” adding that he did mention how he doesn’t want people like Biden and his son contributing to “the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

Trump, speaking to reporters on the White House lawn before flying to Houston, also said he doesn’t believe the person who reported the call is a “whistleblower,” stating that “you can’t have people doing false alarms like this.”

“When the president speaks to the head of another country, he has to be able to speak to those people and those people don’t want to know that they’re being recorded or that you have a stenographer working,” he said. “You don’t want to have to hear that. You can’t do that to a president and you can’t do that to other countries.”

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko similarly dismissed the idea of any crime or scandal in Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,” Prystaiko told Hromadske, a Ukrainian online broadcast outlet. “There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said Sunday that impeachment may be “the only remedy” as President Trump confirmed he discussed Biden and corruption with Ukraine’s president.

Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Schiff said he has been reluctant to join calls to impeach the president, but said the phone call would potentially be “the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office,” during this or any other presidency.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,” he said.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared herself vindicated for being less than two percent Native American, the former Harvard University professor is leading in multiple state and national polls for the 2020 Democrat nomination for president.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Tapper and Schiff.

Dumb and Dumber.

Rinse, wash, repeat…

Welcome to another Russia Collusion Hoax flashback.

These idiots have no imagination, no self-awareness, and they are so exhausted by their own bullshit, so demoralized by loss after loss after loss, they can’t even come up with some fresh ideas or a new way to scream THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN ON THE ORANGE BAD MAN!

Late last week, I wrote about just how stupid this whistleblower scandal is. Now I regret pulling the trigger prematurely, because now that we know more, I underestimated just how stupid this whole thing really is.

The biggest piece of stupid is that even if Trump is guilty of the worst thing he is accused of… So what?

Think about this…

1) After President Obama made Vice President Joe Biden the White House’s point person on Ukraine, Joe Biden’s son, who has absolutely no background — meaning no skill or expertise — in the energy sector, was paid something like a million dollars from a Ukrainian energy company for his, uhm, expertise.

2) When the Ukraine government began to look into this obvious corruption, Biden threatened to withhold critical U.S. aid unless the government agreed to fire the prosecutor investigating his son, and we know this happened because Biden has been stupid enough to brag about it.

3) Trump asks Ukraine to look into all of this.

Here’s today’s big question… Out of those three, which one is a scandal? Bob, I’m going to go with door number one and door number two.

So that’s how the world turns if the scandal is accurate, and we already know it’s not.

Surprise, surprise, y’all — it’s Fake News!

Gee, who saw that coming — I mean, other than everyone.

To begin with, this so-called whistleblower didn’t even hear the phone call he or she is blowing the whistle on. In other words, it’s all hearsay and rumor.

And where does our fake news media hide this rather pertinent fact? In paragraph number 22, naturally.

We also have the Ukrainian foreign minister defending Trump, saying:

I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.

And there you go…

The dumbest part, though, is the political part…

Because the media no longer have any credibility with the public, politicians are no longer judged on these scandals. The public understands the media have an ax to grind and are completely unreliable, so whenever the next big scandal comes along, voters wisely roll their eyes.

What the public does look at, though, is how the politician in question handles the scandal, and if the politician is cool under fire, remains composed, and handles the media storm with savvy and skill, this can actually increase the respect the public have for this person. And so far, Trump is handling the “whistleblower” scandal beautifully, while Joe Biden is having public meltdowns.

Trump has remained calm, cool, confident, and on offense, while Biden, who is already a weak and vulnerable candidate with exploding eyes and loose teeth, looks rattled as he feigns being a tough guy.

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

Buttigieg made those remarks about the controversy over President Donald Trump calling the Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and discussing 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

Buttigieg said, “I think he’s going to act in a lawless matter no matter what. Look, he’s made it clear that he deserves to be impeached. We are also in a reality where the Senate Republicans have completely lost touch with their conscience. I support the House in taking on impeachment proceedings. I also think that the only real resolution to this will be defeating this president and his enablers in the Congressional Republican Caucuses. Look, what’s going on here is shocking. The president of the United States confessed to official misconduct. And nothing appears to be changing around that.”

He added, “We’ve got to demonstrate a better way. Assuming that Senate Republicans won’t do their duty in the event of an impeachment, we’ve got to defeat them.”

If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019

Romney’s comments come after a report published Saturday by the Wall Street Journal which said a whistleblower claimed that the president urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to look into Biden’s son Hunter’s business dealings with the eastern European country.

The report stated:

‘He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know’ whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said. Mr. Trump didn’t mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, said this person, who didn’t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on an investigation.

However, congressional Republicans have come out in defense of President Trump by stating that private phone calls between the president and foreign leaders are imperative if he is to perform his job well.

“The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders. There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI).

CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked President Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on Thursday during Cuomo Primetime whether or not he asked the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

“No, I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden,” Giuliani said. “I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which, tangentially, involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme, not unlike what he did in China.”

On Friday, President Trump defended himself against the whistleblower’s accusations in a tweet.

While speaking to reporters outside the White House on Sunday, the president appeared to be willing to release the transcript of the phone call in question.

“We had a very great conversation, very straight, very honest conversation. I hope they can put it out,” he concluded."

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

Their participation in the Steak Fry comes one day after Friday’s global climate strike, which several of the candidates adamantly praised:

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Julián Castro (D)

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

Beto O’Rourke (D)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

“If the DNC had followed the process they announced in February and kept to the promised 17 [sic] qualifying polls, the lineup of the upcoming third debate might be very different,” Williamson’s communications director Patricia Ewing said prior to the third Democrat debate in Houston, Texas."

That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper, including that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens.

Clinton's call came on the heels of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement on Tuesday of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, as House Democrats increasingly support proceedings to investigate the potential for impeachment.

""We are in a crisis,"" Clinton said, later adding that the House must begin impeachment proceedings ""not happily or with glee"" but to safeguard national security.

(CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just announced that Congress is launching a formal impeachment inquiry. The allegations that President Donald Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in an effort to persuade Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic candidate Joe Biden has turned out to be a genuine tipping point. Seven moderate Democrats with previous military service published an op-ed in the Washington Post. ""We believe these actions represent an impeachable offense,"" they said.

After several months, when Pelosi resisted taking this step for fear of a political backlash, President Trump finally found a way to go too far. It turns out that there might still be a line in American politics, and he just crossed it.

As Democrats officially start the impeachment process and undertake the investigation, they will continue to be haunted by historical comparisons.

Democrats who are leery about moving forward see the late-1990s impeachment of Bill Clinton all over again. With the 2020 election in the balance, they fear that their party will end up like the Republicans, moving forward to impeach the President only to encounter a fierce political backlash against their party for seeming too extreme.

Other Democrats, who have been calling for impeachment since the release of Robert Mueller's report, see a repeat of the early-1970s. In their minds, Trump is the new Richard Nixon, just on steroids. For them, moving forward with impeachment is not only the right thing to do but it will also strengthen the Democrats politically, by putting them on the right side of history.

The truth is we don't know how this will turn out. The trouble with speculation is that the future remains unpredictable. We can make educated guesses about how the politics might unfold and we can look to previous examples to better understand what is happening. But at the end of the day, the impeachment of Trump must be understood on its own terms.

This process will play out within the particular dynamics of 2019 and 2020. It is easy to map out how either prediction could be true. At the same time, it is even easier to imagine how we can't really envision or anticipate what is going to happen and what the ultimate political effects will be.

The impeachment process is always especially uncertain since it revolves around an intense investigation that sheds light on a situation rather than confirming what we already know. This means that, if the process is handled well, we will have many more facts on the table before any vote for articles of impeachment takes place.

While we live in an era where facts often don't matter and the people make decisions based on partisan preferences, dramatic revelations can still shake the status quo. That's what happened with Nixon -- the process itself dramatically changed public opinion. We have just seen that within the past few hours, as the heads of even the most seasoned Washington watchers are spinning.

Democrats need to make their decisions based on the obligations of the office and a respect for our democratic institutions. If there is one big lesson from the last two of our three impeachment processes -- it is that voters rewarded the party that in 1974 took this bold step but did so in a serious way, focusing on the health of our democratic institutions and the balance of power. When the Republican party seemed to move forward in a haphazard and clearly partisan manner in 1997 and 1998, the public disapproved of their actions.

Although politics is naturally always on the mind of any elected official, this is a moment when they need to make those considerations secondary. It looks like Democrats have finally reached a point in their thinking, where they are willing to do what is right rather than what might be the easiest political path."

The Democratic presidential candidate said if Trump ""does not comply with such a request from the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.""

""That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" he said, speaking from Wilmington, Delaware.

Biden's comments on Tuesday were the most direct statement he has made on impeachment. But by making his call for Trump's removal conditional, he stopped short of some of his Democratic rivals, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are calling for the House to impeach Trump now."

Billy Porter, who made history merely by being nominated for his role as the exuberant ballroom emcee Pray Tell in FX’s Pose, a show that explores the “juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York: the rise of the luxury universe, the downtown social and literary scene and the ball culture world.”

In his acceptance speech, Porter said that he was “overjoyed” to win the award and believe that as a gay man he has the “right to be here”:

The category is love, you all. Love. I am so overwhelmed and I am so overjoyed to have lived long enough to see this day. James Baldwin said, “Took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I had been taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around this earth like I had the right to be here.” I have the right. You have the right. We all have the right.

Porter’s success was quickly seized upon by Biden, who claimed that he had inspired a young generation of actors.

“Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us,” Biden wrote. “You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you.”

Porter’s acting has been the source of widespread acclaim from critics following the show’s launch last year, in which his flamboyant character Pray Tell is diagnosed with HIV.

The 50-year-old actor is also known for his flamboyance in real life. At this year’s Oscars, Porter turned up on the red carpet wearing custom tuxedo dress as a tribute to Hector Xtravaganza, who passed away last year, from the House of Xtravaganza, known as one of New York City’s most famous underground ballroom houses.

“It’s just a Democrat witch hunt, here we go again,” Trump said, speaking to reporters as he arrived at the United Nations summit on Monday.

He taunted the establishment media and Democrat coalition for failing with narratives surrounding the Russia investigation and falsely raising the alarm of a looming recession, noting that the hysteria over his Ukraine conversation about Biden was only the latest attempt.

“The one who’s got the problem is Biden,” Trump said, pointing out that Biden was the one who actually threatened in 2014 to withhold aid funding from Ukraine until they fired one of their prosecutors.

The fired prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Biden’s son Hunter was getting paid as much as $50,000 a month to serve on its board.

“What Biden did is a disgrace; what his son did is a disgrace,” Trump said, referring to Hunter Biden. “The son took money from Ukraine; the son took money from China, a lot of money from China.”

Trump said he would continue to talk about corruption in Ukraine with the country’s leaders, noting that Zelensky was elected to weed out corruption.

“We’re supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest … Why would you give money to a country you think is corrupt?” he asked.

He hinted to reporters that the White House may soon release the transcript of his phone call with Zelensky to prove that nothing he said in the conversation was wrong.

Trump also questioned the motives of the whistleblower that first complained about the phone call.

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden lead the Democratic field in New Hampshire, with 27% and 25% support respectively, according to a new poll of likely Democratic primary voters from Monmouth University on Tuesday.

In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 10%.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

He continued: ""I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay, or to do otherwise, would betray the foundation of our democracy.""

The comments from Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and longtime respected member of the Democratic caucus, come as members of his party are increasingly calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Lewis' remarks could help increase support for impeachment, particularly among members of the Congressional Black Caucus, of which the congressman is a member.

Congressional Democrats have been urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has so far been reluctant to support impeachment proceedings, to change her mind on the issue in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to block the release to Congress of a whistleblower complaint.

He added, “By the way, the fact that we don’t even have the whistleblower’s report in Congress is a violation of Congressional rules. It says in the whistleblower rule that the Inspector General shall give this information to the Intelligence Committee. Shall do it.

""Everybody does it,"" Trump said Monday.

That blasé attitude is not reflected in Congress, where the weekend's revelations have led more Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. The worst possible scenario, which not everybody believes, is that Trump used his office and his authority over foreign aid to stir up trouble for a leading 2020 rival.

But the political fight is over more than just whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to get involved in the US presidential election by investigating Biden and his son, Hunter, over Hunter's former business interests. It's also about what must be shared with Congress after a whistleblower raised the alarm, and just how much Trump has changed what's allowed in American politics.

""I'm leading in the polls, they have no idea how they stop me,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday at the United Nations. ""The only way they can try is through impeachment.""

This is a fast moving scandal that's hard to keep track of. Here's what we know about each of the issues at hand:

Did Trump talk to Ukraine's new president about Joe Biden?

Yes. Trump initially denied it, but over the weekend admitted that when he talked to Zelensky on July 25, he brought up Joe Biden. Trump also made clear that in his mind, Biden = corruption.

On Sunday, Trump said of the conversation:

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

The call is part of the whistleblower complaint against Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, a person familiar with the matter said, according to the Journal. While Trump pressed Zelensky, he did not bring up military aid on the call, CNN reported Friday.

Mr. Giuliani is former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has been calling for months for a new inquiry into Biden's role in a corruption purge in Ukraine during the Obama administration. He renewed those calls during a remarkable interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo last Thursday during which he said he asked officials in Ukraine to investigate Biden.

Why is anyone suggesting Trump pressured Zelensky or tied a Biden investigation to military aid?

At the same time Trump was mentioning Biden to Zelensky, Giuliani was actively pushing Ukraine's top prosecutor, who has since left that position, to officially investigate Biden and his son.

That's also about the same time Trump's administration was putting the skids on nearly $400 million aid, including $250 million in military aid and $141 million from the State Department, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on Twitter last week that after he met recently with Zelensky, there was no question the Ukrainian was concerned both about the aid being cut off and about Giuliani's calls for an investigation in Biden.

""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.

Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019

An aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, summed up his contacts with Giuliani in an interview published Monday.

""So, Giuliani and I talked on the phone, and after that we personally met in Madrid. I repeated to him the same points. He noted that it was important for him to hear that the new Ukrainian government would preach the principles of openness and legality, will fight corruption, and set as its goal to make Ukraine successful.""

Who is Zelensky?

Zelensky is a former comedian, and like Trump, a newcomer to politics. Before his election in April, he was better known as the star of a TV show in which he played the President of Ukraine . When he won a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko, he promised to clean up corruption.

Did Zelensky feel pressured by Trump to investigate Biden?

There are conflicting accounts on this. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said over the weekend that his country would not take sides in a US election. ""I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,"" he told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske, according to Reuters . ""This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.""

Did Trump directly tie military aid to Ukraine to investigating Biden?

We don't entirely know. It does not appear Trump ever explicitly told Zelensky that if he didn't investigate Biden, he wouldn't get the military aid. There is a transcript of the call, but it's not clear if or when anyone outside the White House will see it. Some details of the call have been reported, including by CNN

""I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" Trump told reporters on Monday.

He also suggested it's his hope the call's transcript is released: ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon.""

When was the military aid to Ukraine frozen?

CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. Officials from the Office of Management and Budget told officials from the Pentagon and State Department about the freeze at a meeting in mid-July, according to The Washington Post

When and how were the funds frozen?

Trump admitted he withheld the money in comments to reporters at the UN Tuesday. He said he wanted Europe to do more for Ukraine. But then he added the money was ultimately paid. He didn't point out it was ultimately paid because of an objection from Democrats.

""My complaint has always been -- and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,"" he said. Because they not doing it, it's the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money.

Mulvaney has long been skeptical of the aid. Former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not agree on much, but they did agree that Ukraine should get the aid. Congressional staffers say Congress was in the dark on the holdup.

""The administration did not notify us that the aid was frozen,"" according to a Senate aide. ""The House Appropriations Committee learned of it on or about August 23rd and informed us, and then the first news stories appeared days later. In response to our inquiries, DoD confirmed to us that the funds were frozen on August 28th.""

Further, according to CNN reporting, officials in Ukraine were never formally told the funds were being frozen.

Why does Trump keep returning to Biden and Ukraine?

Politics. Trump wants to attack Biden's credibility. Every time Trump is asked about his conversation with Zelensky, he returns to his message about Biden, as he did on Twitter Monday.

""Now the Fake News Media says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.' This supposedly comes from a so-called 'whistleblower' who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.......Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren't pressured at all during the 'nice' call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That's the real story!""

An important note: There have been no serious allegations of specific wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. An investigation into a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board, had been shelved by a prosecutor before Biden and many other Western officials and Ukrainians called for him to step down. Biden had threatened aid in the form of loan guarantees if the prosecutor did not leave office.

When did Trump's focus on Biden and Ukraine start?

This is a story that has been percolating for some time. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating the natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden. CNN reported in August that Giuliani and Yermak, the aide to Zelensky, had spoken several times over the phone and met in Madrid.

Now according to The Washington Post, Giuliani said he has had five conversations with Yermak.

Separately, Giuliani told the Post he did not address the issue of US aid to Ukraine in the Madrid person to person meeting this summer. ""I was not involved in the aid at all,"" he said, referring to military aid. ""I had no idea the $250 million was on the table.""

He said that Yermak was pushing for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president and that the Ukrainians were ""embarrassed"" there had not been one yet.

Giuliani has said he essentially stumbled upon the Biden element. He had been pushing in Ukraine on an effort to clear Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who is currently in jail for tax evasion on money he made for political consulting in Ukraine and elsewhere.

Why does Ukraine need US military aid?

Ukraine is dealing with Russian-backed separatists in the Eastern part of the country and still opposes Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. The country is very much standing between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the West.

What is the aid used for?

The assistance, according to previous CNN reports , is for sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, night vision and military medical treatment -- all of which Ukrainians could use to counter pro-Russian separatists.

What was the official reason that aid to Ukraine was frozen?

The White House has said it wanted to make sure the new administration in Ukraine would stay true to its word and cut down on corruption.

Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, denied earlier this month that the holdup had anything to do with Biden, but he did say, ""We have great concerns about issues of corruption... I mean, to invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine.""

That's very similar to language Trump used Sunday, except Trump tied the idea of corruption in Ukraine to Biden, perhaps further suggesting a link between the money and the investigation.

Trump returned to corruption during his comments to reporters at the United Nations on Monday.

""If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" he said. ""One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption. It's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important.""

How was the aid unfrozen?

There was bipartisan opposition to the freeze up on Capitol Hill. CNN reported on September 12 that the administration had suddenly dropped its opposition to the aid after Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, got bipartisan support for an amendment to force the administration's hand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally who nevertheless supported the aid to Ukraine, gave Durbin credit for making the aid happen.

""So why was it released? Because of your amendment, that's why it was released,"" Graham said during an appropriations hearing earlier in September. ""Because I was going to vote for it, so I think they got the message. If you're listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you're going to get the money.""

Has Ukraine gotten any of the aid?

""The Department of Defense was able to begin obligating these funds last week. We will continue to leverage all available tools to expedite the implementation of these programs. We expect the majority of the funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year,"" according to Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.

Some $60 million had been obligated fairly quickly (as of last Monday), according to a US official. The Pentagon is confident that it can obligate $220 million before the end of the fiscal year and is working with Congress to get an extension to continue the aid delivery. The House voted last week to extend the window for the aid through November.

Why is it important when Trump talked to Zelensky?

It's completely incredible that Trump may have pressured the Ukrainian president, essentially asking him to investigate a US political rival, in the very midst of denying his campaign colluded with Russia's election interference in 2016.

On Wednesday, July 24, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about all of the Trump campaign interactions with Russia in 2016 and explained why his report did not recommend charges against the President or his aides for seeking political help from a foreign government.

""NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!"" Trump tweeted that day and his allies hailed the end of calls for impeachment. Turns out things were just beginning. He talked to Zelensky the next day.

What is the fight over the whistleblower?

While there had been plenty of reporting on Biden's involvement in the Ukraine, on Giuliani's quest to highlight it for campaign season and on the temporary halt of aid to Ukraine, the whistleblower complaint is what tied them all together.

But the White House tried very hard to keep it quiet. While Congress should be entitled under the law to hear about whistleblower complaints, the White House had justified keeping it from Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General informed lawmakers that the complaint existed, but no one outside the intelligence community or the White House has actually seen it.

That's because the DNI has, on the advice of the White House and Department of Justice, resisted providing the report to Congress and have said it is not actually covered by the whistleblower law.

What are Democrats saying?

Even some Democrats who had opposed impeachment proceedings against Trump are now saying there is no alternative.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution,"" said Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez on CNN Monday. ""We must move forward with impeachment proceedings.""

""I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" he said. ""It seems like the President is really pushing us for impeachment proceedings. I don't know if he's baiting us because he has a personal agenda that he thinks this might be helpful to him.""

What is Trump saying now?

He was asked exactly during an appearance Monday at the United Nations if he's taking impeachment seriously.

""Not at all seriously,"" Trump said, denying any wrongdoing and staying impeccably on-message that this whole thing has more to do with Biden.

""We had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""Everybody knows it's just a Democrat witch hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession and now they're bringing this up. The one who has the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do except one problem, I didn't do it.""

Days after dismissing and downplaying a whistleblower's complaint , Trump has now acknowledged he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and CNN has reported that the President pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

But Trump has since tried to obfuscate any wrongdoing on his part and instead try to train the spotlight on Biden.

""Joe Biden and his son are corrupt,"" Trump claimed without offering specifics on Monday, his first day at the United Nations General Assembly, an annual gathering of world leaders in New York.

Trump, who was in the middle of a broad review of foreign aid programs when he singled out Ukraine specifically this summer, was primarily concerned with ""corruption"" in Ukraine and Europe shouldering more of the financial burden for supporting Ukraine's defense, according to one of the officials.

News of Trump's order to withhold aid to the Ukraine ahead of his July 25 call may trigger questions -- and speculation -- about the President's motive in doing so.

Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of military and security aid to Ukraine at least a week before the call in question, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The Washington Post first reported the figure.

The administration was looking at harnessing multiple foreign packages, several aides believed, when Trump took a special interest in Ukraine, at times railing about how the country wasted money in his eyes. This surprised several staffers because, as CNN has reported, Trump had not been interested in engaging with Ukraine in the past, believing Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform.

Trump's administration has already intervened to keep secret the whistleblower complaint that appears to be related to Ukraine -- thereby blocking the normal process that would inform Congress of the controversy.

(It doesn't. Trump has made clear that a) he talked to the Ukrainian President and b) mentioned on that call the idea that Biden and his son, Hunter, might be involved in corrupt activity in the country.)

Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who was once seen as a rare Republican willing to question Trump, had this to say when asked by Vice's Liz Landers if he had a comment on the Trump/Ukraine news: ""You're welcome to talk to James in my office."" And Texas Sen. John Cornyn had this to say about the whistleblower : ""I am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came form somebody that didn't have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire.""

So, yeah. The reason that questions about Trump's behavior throughout this Ukraine drama won't be the final straw in the Republican relationship with Trump is because there will never be a final straw in Republicans' relationship with Trump. When he won the GOP nomination, the vast, vast, vast majority of GOPers simply decided that even though they didn't support him initially and still had LOTS of questions about how he went about things, Trump was channeling their base and the only way to stay alive politically was to support him without question.

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

A handful of Democrats who have spent Trump's presidency warning against the consequences of a distracting impeachment inquiry have used the latest allegations -- where Trump admitted to discussing his possible 2020 political rival Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- to signal a ""tipping point.""

While most left some wiggle room in their stance on impeachment, Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota issued a statement saying she is ""immediately"" calling for proceedings.

""We must safeguard our electoral process and our very democracy from outside threats. For this reason, the current investigations into corruption must continue. And when there is an abuse of power of this magnitude, it is our responsibility to stand up for what is right. This is why I am calling to open impeachment proceedings -- immediately, fairly, and impartially.""

In a Washington Post op-ed published Monday night, seven freshman Democrats wrote that ""if these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.""

""We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of 'inherent contempt' and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security,"" the op-ed read.

The move by the freshman Democrats -- Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia -- marks a notable escalation from a group of lawmakers who are vulnerable in the 2020 election. Crow had previously called for an impeachment inquiry earlier in the summer, but the other lawmakers were signaling their potential openness for the first time.

Sherrill said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President"" and noted her concern that impeachment would shift focus from her constituents' needs, citing fixes to health care and taxes.

""Quite frankly, in my district, it is not enough to impeach the President. In fact, many people probably won't agree with my decision,"" Sherrill said.

But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts ""crossed a line"" for her and the six other freshmen Democrats.

""I think we all understood the implications of this right away. Many of us, if not all of us, have worked overseas. We've worked with foreign governments. We've worked to protect our national security and democracy, so this was a red line. We coalesced on this very quickly,"" Sherrill said of the group's decision to pen the op-ed.

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the inspector general of the intelligence community in August. The complaint hasn't been shared with lawmakers, despite Democratic calls for the acting director of national intelligence to comply with a legal requirement to do so.

Rep. Vincente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who has thus far resisted calling for Trump's impeachment, told CNN on Monday that he would reconsider his position if the administration does not turn over the whistleblower complaint regarding the President and Ukraine to the House Intelligence Committee this week.

Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday, Gonzalez said if Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, Hunter.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.

Gonzalez reiterated his stance in statement to CNN following the interview, saying he would ""seriously consider joining the calls to open an impeachment inquiry"" if the complaint isn't handed over.

Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota freshman Democrat who has also not embraced impeachment, said Monday that Democrats ""must pursue articles of impeachment and report them to the full House of Representatives for immediate consideration"" if reports about the whistleblower complaint are corroborated.

""This continues a pattern of behavior that is corrupt at best, treasonous at worst, and puts our rule of law at risk,"" Phillips said in a statement. ""Our Constitution transcends any person, politician, or political party, and I call on the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Judiciary Committees to use every legal mechanism possible to obtain all relevant evidence.""

And Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long pushed against pursuing impeachment, separately said on Monday that the complaint could lead to impeachment, calling the situation ""deeply concerning.""

""If fully substantiated, it will be of momentous consequence, including the possibility of initiating impeachment proceedings,"" Lynch said in a statement.

As recently as last month, he was arguing that conducting impeachment proceedings would hand Trump another four years in the White House.

In a news release Monday night, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said she has been reluctant to call for impeachment, but ""these actions regarding the 2020 election are a turning point.""

Impeachment, she said, ""may be the only recourse Congress has"" if Trump is enlisting foreign help in the 2020 election.

Their comments came after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN's Jake Tapper over the weekend that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon"" and impeachment could be ""the only remedy"" equal to the offense.

The controversy surrounding Trump's dealings with Ukraine has added fuel to already-heated discussions among Democrats about whether to pursue impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee is conducting an investigation to determine whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment, but Democratic leaders are divided about the issue.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has thus far resisted calls to launch such proceedings over concern that an impeachment push would be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate and would imperil Democrats' 2020 election chances.

Pelosi, in a letter to all members of Congress over the weekend, said that the standoff could escalate Democrats' ongoing investigation into Trump.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" she wrote.

But some lawmakers say they are hearing from constituents who want to see Democrats take action beyond just more investigation, and soon.

""Phones have been ringing all day with constituents calling to tell me they support impeachment, particularly following the President's corrupt dealings with Ukraine,"" Virginia Rep. Don Beyer wrote on Twitter Monday. ""They are right.""

The White House is making its own moves, making public a key telephone transcript and preparing to release to Congress a whistleblower's report as early as Wednesday, according to two sources familiar. Politico first reported the White House's intention . One source told CNN the whistleblower report is under review and going through declassification and could be released within hours of the transcript release.

The investigation will test accusations that Trump sought to pressure a foreign power -- Ukraine -- into effectively intervening in the 2020 election to damage one of his possible Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden.

""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in a news conference. ""Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.""

Trump lamented the news in that it took the focus off his trip the United Nations General Assembly.

""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!"" the President.

Her decision elevates the turmoil and division whipped up by Trump's two-and-half years in power to historic proportions with massive political stakes for the 2020 election and beyond.

Pelosi, after months of trying to slow walk impeachment demands from her liberal base, elected to strike, despite the President agreeing to release a transcript on Wednesday of a call with Ukraine's President. Trump says the document will clear him of wrongdoing despite his public admission that he pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into Biden and his son -- a fact in itself that his opponents argue is a gross abuse of power.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Only two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Now there is the possibility it could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump's presidency.

An impeachment inquiry would be the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself.

Unfolding events

Tuesday's developments unfolded at staggering speed in Washington and in New York where the President's ""America First"" speech to the United General Assembly was overshadowed.

Trump decided to release the transcript under fierce political pressure over claims, first triggered by a whistleblower's complaint, that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military and security aid to force Kiev to open an investigation into his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son, Hunter.

There is no evidence to support claims -- made in public by Trump as recently as Tuesday morning -- that the Bidens had corrupt dealings with the former Soviet Republic.

At the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25.

He said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share.

Later, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript -- opposed by senior aides -- would show that there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump tweeted.

Some senior Democrats however insist that there need not be a quid pro quo for Trump to have committed a ""high crime and misdemeanor"" needed for a President to be impeached.

The simple fact of a President asking a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political opponent is seen by many legal and political commentators as an abuse of power.

Pelosi's strategy

In an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: ""The President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country.""

The House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it's possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question.

But she shifted her position as a political torrent changed the shape of the impeachment debate in Washington. A number of moderate swing-state Democrats who she had been trying to protect, moved to the impeachment side of the argument.

She said that the nature of Trump's alleged offense was clear -- a factor that might have changed the political equation.

""This is the most understandable by the public. And It's really important to know this. There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,"" she said. ""You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That's what we try to stop with Russia. It's wrong.""

Pelosi told her caucus that the impeachment would center around six House committees already investigating the President. It would be up to the Judiciary Committee eventually to decide whether to advance Articles of Impeachment. If the full House votes by simple majority to impeach a President his trial then takes place in the Senate.

There is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP controlled chamber is waning. That means the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict the president on Articles of Impeachment and to oust him from office looks at this point unlikely to materialize.

Like Pelosi, Biden also seems to be calculating his political position. As the subject of Trump's attacks and the Democratic front runner, he is in a unique position in the cascading drama.

In an on camera appearance apparently meant to project presidential gravitas and temperament, the former vice president said that if Trump failed to provide information about the case, he would leave lawmakers with no choice.

""Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American president. It's an abuse of power,"" Biden said.

""Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" Biden said.

Obstacles

Democratic reluctance to move ahead with impeachment, despite what many in the party see as gross abuses of power revealed by special counsel Robert Mueller, has partly been based on fears of igniting Trump's base and causing a 2020 political backlash.

Impeachment -- that can result in a democratic election being overturned -- is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years.

In another potentially enormous development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump's conduct, wants to speak to the committee.

The whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. Maguire had been under pressure from the White House and Justice Department not to turn over the whistleblower's complaint, but that appeared to change late Tuesday, so it was not clear how realistic are Democratic hopes of hearing the testimony.

Trump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar told CNN. It's unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint.

Two White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be ""underwhelming.""

One of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important. But the official raised questions about the credibility of the the administration employee who filed the complaint about Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian President, referring to the employee as ""the so-called whistleblower."""

The letters from Sen. Bob Menendez -- sent to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Inspector General Steve Linick -- come after the New Jersey Democrat made clear on the House floor Monday that he would seek more information on the call as House Democrats near a ""tipping point"" on impeachment in the wake of the Trump administration blocking a related whistleblower complaint's release to Congress.

On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part o f the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

In his letter to Linick, Menendez requests that the Inspector General ""immediately open an investigation"" into the Trump administration's withholding of foreign military assistance to Ukraine and whether it was tied to the whistleblower complaint.

Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint.

It's the latest example of how Republicans are extremely reluctant to criticize the leader of their party even in the face of a growing controversy with many outstanding questions.

The tone was set by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, when he opened the chamber floor and blasted Democrats for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known.

McConnell also refused to tell reporters if he believed the formal whistleblower complaint that's being held back by the administration should be made available to Congress or if Trump was wrong to discuss with the Ukrainian President possible investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden.

The facts of whether the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic general election opponent Joe Biden while a US military aid package was on the table are still obscured.

Trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and note that an intelligence community whistleblower who raised the alarm was operating with a second-hand knowledge of Trump's conversations.

But if Trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing US elections, it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours.

It would amount to a situation in which Trump's team, which according to the Mueller report expected to benefit from Russian election meddling in 2016, is now using the power of the presidency to incite collusion ahead of the 2020 election.

That possibility seemed to unlock a shift Sunday in the Democratic position on impeachment. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon."" And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who has been loath to contemplate an impeachment drama -- warned that events might necessitate a ""new stage of investigation.""

Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels, told CNN on Monday morning, ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus.""

Republican senators who have strongly supported Trump were largely silent but Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted Sunday ""it would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and that it is ""critical for the facts to come out.""

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. The then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko said in May that Burisma Holdings, a major energy company, did not violate Ukrainian law by having Hunter Biden on its board and paying him.

Trump's claims that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he investigated a business for which his son served as a board member have previously been found to be false. The prosecutor was seen as corrupt by multiple governments and international institutions, not just the former vice president.

Why pressure by Trump on Ukrainians would matter

Presidents are expected to act in the interests of all Americans and not to use their vast discretion in foreign policy to pursue political vendettas or subvert US democracy. The Founders saw the presidency as a public trust, meaning that its incumbents should not put their personal interests over the national interest. The Ukraine story is so significant because it may have the potential to fall into such grave constitutional territory and could represent an abuse of presidential power.

Trump and his team seemed at odds Sunday over whether to publish the transcript of his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

And they went on offense in typical fashion, bending facts and spinning conspiracy theories, obfuscation and hypocrisy.

Trump insisted that he said ""absolutely nothing wrong"" in the call with the Ukrainian president. ""It was perfect,"" he said. Trump often gives the impression that he believes he is not constrained by norms on the limits of power observed by past presidents. In July for instance, he said, falsely, that Article 2 of the Constitution ""allows me to do whatever I want as President.""

Past scrapes like the 2016 Russian election meddling scandal -- and multiple controversies ranging from his insulting behavior toward the late Sen. John McCain to his payments to women who claimed they had affairs with him -- have failed to bring him down. His emergence from each may have taught him a lesson.

Trump says he spoke to Ukrainian President about Biden

Trump on Sunday appeared to add new context to the Ukraine story when he said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president at a time when Kiev was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States. The call with Zelensky took place on July 25. Congress passed the bill in August and the White House lifted a hold on the money in September.

""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said.

CNN has reported that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden's son in a call on July 25, but did not discuss a pending aid package at the time, indicating there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined in the conversation.

The latest developments highlighted Pelosi's reluctance to trigger impeachment proceedings against Trump amid fears of a political backlash. But Schiff, a Pelosi ally, suggested things may be about to change.

""This would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort and not first resort,"" Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""But if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.""

Pelosi and Schiff were in close coordination throughout the weekend talking about the Ukraine whistleblower story and coordinating strategy, a leadership aide confirmed to CNN.

The way that events could force the hands of Democratic leaders became even clearer later on Sunday.

Pelosi hinted at a change of strategy in a message to Democratic colleagues, over half of whom had already backed the idea of impeachment.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi wrote on Sunday.

Democratic reluctance on impeachment

Pelosi has been reluctant to embrace impeachment since Senate Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict the President. There is also no desire to set Trump's political base alight as Democrats try to keep their House majority in 2020.

If Trump's behavior is exposed as corrupt, Democrats may be forced into impeachment hearings -- whatever the long-term political cost.

To do nothing would be to accept that a President can abuse his power by seeking foreign interference in American democracy. Trump would feel validated and emboldened.

The balance between Congress and the Presidency will have been fundamentally altered and there will be few checks and balances left capable of constraining Trump and future presidents.

Inaction might also be politically unsustainable since Democrats might see their own leaders as willing to use the power of a House majority to defend their own presidential front-runner.

Democrats, both freshmen from Trump-won districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations on Monday morning.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

Trump allies hit back

Seeking to fog such questions, Trump's lieutenants went on the offensive on Sunday talk shows using a familiar playbook.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived debunked questions about Biden's conduct.

""I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week.""

""America cannot have our elections interfered with, and if that's what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.""

For the administration to make an argument about electoral interference seems somewhat rich, given that Trump has long rejected evidence that Russia intervened in 2016 to help him.

On ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was no reason to believe Trump pressured Ukraine, though admitted he wasn't on the call in question.

And he argued that Biden's son should not have been allowed to do business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Asked by Jake Tapper Sunday about the glaring inconsistency in this statement since Trump's children continue to work globally on a business from which the President has not fully divested, Mnuchin dodged.

""I don't really want to go into more of these details,"" Mnuchin said.

Both Mnuchin and Pompeo opposed releasing transcripts of Trump's calls, arguing that a President has a right to confidentiality in conversations with foreign leaders.

The administration's efforts to stop acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from releasing the whistleblower report to Congress, and its opposition to releasing a transcript, are only fueling speculation the White House has something to hide. If there was wrongdoing such conduct could equal obstruction of justice, historically an impeachable offense.

Trump, however, said that he hoped they would release the transcript.

Biden, meanwhile, spent the weekend defending himself and trying to turn the scandal to his own advantage in a tight primary race.

""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden said.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Schumer urged Republicans to “fulfill your constitutional duty” by probing the complaint, which is believed to center around President Trump allegedly urging Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s scandals in the Eastern European country.

“In the face of this dire warning and the Trump Administration’s effort to cover it up, the Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution’s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight,” Schumer wrote.

“The Republican Senate’s ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude toward such a serious national security concern is unacceptable and must change,” he added, before calling on McConnell to hold hearings and issue a subpoena for the complaint.

House Intelligence Committee members were briefed last week by Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, about the complaint, though the official would not provide specifics to lawmakers or comply with panel chair Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) demand that he turn over the complaint, due to executive privilege.

Buried in establishment media’s reportage on the complaint is the fact that the so-called whistleblower did not have “direct knowledge of the communications.”

Speaking Sunday to reporters, President Trump said his conversation with Zelensky was “largely congratulatory,” adding that he did mention how he does not want people like Biden and his son contributing to “the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

“When the president speaks to the head of another country, he has to be able to speak to those people and those people don’t want to know that they’re being recorded or that you have a stenographer working,” the president said ahead of a trip to Houston, Texas, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “You don’t want to have to hear that. You can’t do that to a president and you can’t do that to other countries.”

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko has also dismissed the notion of any wrongdoing in President Trump’s called with Zelensky, telling Hromadske, a Ukrainian online broadcast outlet, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

“There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers,” Prystaiko added.

Though there is still much unknown about the so-called complaint, House Democrat leaders such as Schiff, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have suggested the Trump-Zelensky call could be grounds for impeachment.

“If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” Pelosi wrote to lawmakers on Sunday.

Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Schiff (D-CA) said Sunday that impeachment may be “the only remedy” as President Trump confirmed he discussed Biden and corruption with Ukraine’s president.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,” he said.

The announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President.

""Today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" Pelosi said in a brief speech in the Capitol, adding, ""The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.""

""Actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,"" the House speaker said.

The House speaker, who has long pushed to keep her caucus away from the politically divisive issue, is responding to the seismic shift among Democratic members, following Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian President. Dozens of House Democrats -- many from moderate or Trump-won districts -- have announced their support for an impeachment inquiry over the past 48 hours.

""This week, the President has admitted to asking the President of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in her public remarks.

In advance of that statement, Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also announced plans to vote on a resolution of disapproval on Wednesday for allegations ""that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals -- and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation."" Their statement did not mention impeachment.

'Full speed ahead'

Pelosi consulted Tuesday afternoon with the six House Democratic leaders to discuss their presentation to the caucus later in the day, Democratic sources familiar with the issue said. In that closed-door meeting before her public announcement, Pelosi said the six chairmen will continue to investigate under a powerful new umbrella of an impeachment inquiry.

A separate source in the room said the speaker added, ""Here we are. A moment of truth. Truth is what this has been about all along.""

""He's taken it to another level of betrayal therefore we're moving forward with another level of inquiry,"" Pelosi said.

Behind the scenes, Pelosi has encouraged members of her caucus to state their impeachment position now in order to show there is a groundswell in the caucus. She is also conveying that message to freshmen.

On Tuesday, Pelosi also told the caucus that the impeachment inquiry will be done ""expeditiously,"" but wasn't specific in her timeframe, according to a source in the room.

Rep. Jackie Speier told CNN that the President's actions in regards to Ukraine were so egregious, that there has been a ""dramatic"" shift by Pelosi.

""I think she's very laser-focused on this offense as being so egregious that it warrants a full blown impeachment inquiry,"" she said.

Asked what the timeline is for this, she said, ""swiftly.""

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Tuesday after Pelosi's remarks, ""I only have one thing to say, full speed ahead.""

Tide changing for Pelosi allies and vulnerable House freshmen

Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday announced his support for impeachment proceedings, arguing that ""now is the time to act"" and any delay ""would betray the foundation of our democracy.""

""We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution,"" the Georgia Democrat said in a speech on the House floor . ""The future of our democracy is at stake.""

Some of Pelosi's closest allies, including House Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, have signaled their support for impeachment proceedings — a significant indicator that the speaker could be moving closer to backing the divisive political procedure.

Another crucial development has been multiple high profile freshmen Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016 either coming out publicly to fully endorse the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry or at least opening the door to proceedings , citing Trump's actions as forcing them to act.

One of those freshman Democrats, Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, stressed on CNN ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President."" But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts was ""just a line that I think was too much for all of us.""

Pelosi has cited the House members in GOP-leaning districts as part of her hesitance to embrace impeachment, and the groundswell of statements over the past 48 hours could signal a tipping point in the political calculus.

""If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government,"" Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan said in a statement Tuesday. Stevens had told CNN last month that she had ""mixed reviews from the people of my district"" on the issue of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.

So far, as many as 165 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to a CNN count, and that doesn't include the House Democrats who've said in recent days that the President's behavior is a turning point in Democrats' oversight into the administration.

Pelosi has, for months, resisted pursuing impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of House Judiciary, told CNN on Tuesday morning that he believes articles of impeachment are ""inevitable"" and said there's a ""growing clamor throughout the Democratic caucus"" to deal with Trump's ""reckless and lawless"" behavior.

Some holdouts remain

But some vulnerable Democrats in 2020 are still treading cautiously on the issue.

Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah told CNN on Tuesday that he's ""considering"" impeachment, but didn't want to discuss the issue further.

""Before making any judgments, I want to know the facts of what occurred between the President and Ukraine,"" McAdams said. ""I share Sen. (Mitt) Romney's view that If the President used his position to pressure a foreign power to dig up dirt on a rival for his own personal gain, it would be deeply troubling. I believe it would be a betrayal of the loyalty owed to our country and the Constitution.""

Rep. Max Rose, another endangered House Democrat, told CNN that he has not moved off his opposition to impeachment, but argued that ""we have to get to the facts"" of the allegations.

""It is impossible to not take these allegations seriously. It is a national security matter,"" the New York Democrat said Tuesday on Capitol Hill, adding, ""It's incredibly serious ... what I'm not going to do is jump to make another declaration.""

Asked if that meant he is opposed to moving ahead on impeachment, Rose said, ""My current position right now is clear, but that is not a justification to not take these points as seriously as possible.""

Rep. Susan Wild stood up during the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday and argued that Pelosi should cancel some of the upcoming two week recess to not lose momentum, according to a source in the room.

The House, at the end of the week, will recess for two weeks for a district work period over the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holidays.

CNN previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.

There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats.

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call over the summer with Ukraine's president, but denied doing anything improper.

CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported this.

In her public remarks on Tuesday, Pelosi said, ""The law is unequivocal: it says the DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide congress the full whistleblower complaint,"" Pelosi said.

Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel's impeachment investigation. That vote came, however, as Democrats struggled to publicly define the committee probe with Nadler saying the committee is conducting an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had refrained from calling it that.

In a nod to the ongoing investigations in the House, Pelosi said on Tuesday, ""For the past several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so that the House can gather all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity, approval of articles of impeachment.""

The House Speaker also said in her speech, ""I can say with authority the Trump administration's actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and our protections of whistleblowers.""

But the Kentucky Republican and his fellow GOP senators did not explicitly commit to pushing for the full complaint turned over to the committee.

McConnell's pledge came the same day Trump announced he would release an ""unredacted transcript"" of the call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump encouraged the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

It also came on the same day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry to investigate the allegations.

On Monday McConnell blasted Democrats for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known.

The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to meet in a classified setting Thursday with the Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson where they will be asked to testify about what they know about the whistleblower complaint.

McConnell said the Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, would look into the issue.

""We're going to find out what happened. In the Senate, through a process pre-established through the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors initially with the acting director of DNI,"" McConnell said. ""I think that is the responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan way to proceed with what we think we know at this particular point.""

Burr was tight-lipped Monday about how his committee would respond to the complaint, although finally said he want to ""bring the interested parties in"" before the committee.

The top Democrat on the committee is Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

""This is one step in a process. This is an orderly process, where the Committee, the full Committee, will get a chance to hear from both the IC Inspector General, Mr. (Michael) Atkinson , and the Acting DNI, Admiral Maguire,"" Warner said. ""But again, we're going to take this one step at a time, and I think it's terribly important to get the facts.""

A Senate Democrat source told CNN that Democrats are trying to remain focused on obtaining the whistleblower complaint itself despite Trump's announcement Tuesday he will release the transcript from his call with Zelensky. The thinking is, per this source, that the concerns about Trump's conduct do not hinge completely on what is in the transcript.

Multiple sources have also noted that the Democrats maintain the acting DNI is required to provide the complaint to Congress by law.

The second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Thune, did not say if Republicans will insist the administration turn over the whistleblower's formal complaint.

""We'll know a lot more when the Intel Committee meets with them this week,"" Thune said. ""If it's an intelligence related issue then it probably falls under the committee's jurisdiction and I'm sure they will be anxious to get all those answers.""

Also Tuesday, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a resolution authored by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full compliant to Congress.

Schumer, D-New York, said the resolution was ""aimed at a recalcitrant executive branch, which has blocked the ability for the committees to see the complaint, even though the law requires it.""

McConnell said Republicans would go along with the resolution in the spirit that it would assist the Intelligence Committee conduct its investigation."

In a letter to McConnell on Monday, Schumer writes that he is calling on the majority leader and Senate Republicans who control the chamber to ""take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an Intelligence Community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the Administration's handling of security assistance to Ukraine.""

Schumer calls for hearings ""to determine exactly what prompted the whistleblower to file this urgent complaint,"" and says they should feature testimony from a host of administration officials, including acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Schumer also calls for testimony from Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani.

Schumer also states that a subpoena should be issued ""to compel the delivery of the whistleblower complaint to Congress, as required by law.""

The letter is the latest effort by congressional Democratic leaders to push for an investigation into the whistleblower complaint amid a controversy surrounding Trump and his contact with Ukraine.

Maguire has faced immediate scrutiny in his role after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comply with a deadline to hand over the whistleblower complaint to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent.""

The whistleblower complaint deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.

On the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, word began to spread that Trump was reviewing a plan to cut foreign assistance to Ukraine.

Webster's dictionary defines it, in part, as: ""the externalization of blame, guilt, or responsibility as a defense against anxiety.""

Here's one recent, relevant example: ""The one who's got the problem is Biden, because if you look at what Biden did, Biden did what they would like to have me do except there's one problem: I didn't do it.""

That, of course, was President Donald Trump, trying to deflect accusations about the covered-up whistleblower's complaint. It reportedly raised concerns about his call with the Ukrainian President, during which, Trump has essentially admitted, he asked for dirt on a political rival's family.

Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn.

In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower's complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.

""We will have no choice,"" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report.

During the flight, Pelosi read a Washington Post op-ed from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.

She said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president's actions ""represent an impeachable offense.""

""It will be a big week,"" Pelosi said.

The reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it's still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.

Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even after President Donald Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.

That's why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday's high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump's conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint.

Plus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond -- particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts -- to see if it's time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.

The House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.

""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,"" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening.

'When are Democrats going to get tough?'

The impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.

Democrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday.

""This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?"" Connolly said. ""We are looking weak.""

So far, as many as 137 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according a CNN count -- more than half the caucus and with dozens having joined in the past two months. But that number is still far below a majority of House members and Pelosi has long warned of the political consequences of taking such a step against the Presidents.

Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on ""Newsroom"" Monday, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said if Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.

New subpoena threat

The new comments from Democratic lawmakers Monday comes as three House committees threatened to subpoena the State Department over ""documents the State Department has been withholding in response to a letter the Chairmen sent two weeks ago relating to efforts by the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to solicit the help of a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 Presidential Election."" Three chairmen -- House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings -- authored a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,"" the three chairmen wrote jointly. ""Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.""

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former vice president in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.

(CNN) With Tuesday's announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Pelosi has finally put constitutional duty above perceived political expediency.

House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently slow-played the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding Ukraine scandal

Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's own admissions and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump suspended $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.

Trump and his defenders claim his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump stated Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection? Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries?

Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid.

Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could.

And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own original statement, made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son.""

So, what crimes could Trump be violation of?

Foreign election aid -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.

While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a leading contender to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?

Bribery -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself has drawn that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump has made clear that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.

Extortion is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The suspension of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.

Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office.

But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.

Impeachment need not be based on a crime. The Constitution prescribes impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be drawn from English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.

The Constitution separates impeachment from criminal prosecution. Draft articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to abuse of power for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine).

This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.

Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi is now changing course on impeachment.

By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Now, your questions

Lee, California: Does the House Intel Committee have a legal right to see the intelligence community whistleblower complaint about Trump?

On its face, the law is straightforward . If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- reviewed the complaint and found that it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.

But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI concluded that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President.

That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.

That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.

Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?

Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution explicitly grants the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.

In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus was impeached and convicted on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.

Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?

As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have openly contemplated utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact, nobody has ever been fined by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama convincingly argues that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.

While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would fight all the fines. Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up.

Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.

Three questions to watch

1) Will Pelosi finally see the light and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment?

2) Will House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff take the intelligence community whistleblower case to court?"

However, some senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders. At particular issue: White House concern about giving Congress ammunition to demand transcripts of Trump's calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump's acknowledgment that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president has intensified scrutiny on his interactions and decisions on Ukraine.

On Friday CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump remained unclear about the fate of the transcript on Monday, speaking about the Ukraine controversy multiple times during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

""Perhaps you'll see it, perhaps you won't see that, it depends on what we want to do,"" Trump said of the transcript. The President again denied that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens.

""I did not make a statement that, 'You have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" he said.

But Trump again suggested he hoped to release a transcript of his conversation.

""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,"" he said.

More mixed signals

House Democrats have demanded to see the full complaint a whistleblower filed last month with the intelligence community inspector general -- a document the administration, including the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel -- has fought to keep secret. The complaint includes the Ukraine call, a source told CNN, but may not necessarily be limited to that one incident.

Over the weekend, White House officials solicited opinions from outside advisers about whether they should release the transcript of Trump's call with the Zelensky, as well as how advisers think the White House should message it if the transcript was ""embarrassing.""

A person familiar with the discussions said the White House Counsel's Office is currently involved in evaluating whether the transcript should be released and in what form. The source said the release could happen ""soon.""

But Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary, sounded a reluctant note this morning on Fox News.

""I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent. He is willing to do it, I think. But there is a lot of other people, lawyers and such that may have a problem with it. So we will see what happens,"" Grisham said.

Officials are also looking at potential redactions of Zelensky's portion of the conversation.

On Saturday, Trump raised the possibility of releasing a transcript of the call to a ""respected source"" for review.

In March, White House counsel Pat Cipillone sent a letter to Congress saying the administration would not release any conversations Trump has had with foreign leaders, citing longstanding precedent. That letter came in the context of White House efforts to shield Trump's conversations with Putin. But releasing the Zelensky call could undermine the White House's pre-existing efforts to keep those Putin conversations secret, which is one of several concerns inside the White House over putting out details of the call.

'A terrible precedent'

Another concern -- voiced on the Sunday shows by Pompeo and Mnuchin -- is that publishing the call could chill candor when Trump speaks with foreign leaders in the future. Both suggested Trump requires an expectation of privacy in order to conduct diplomacy effectively.

""I think that would be a terrible precedent,"" Mnuchin said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential, and if every time someone for political reasons raised a question, and all of a sudden those conversations were disclosed publicly ... then why would world leaders want to have conversations together?""

Pompeo echoed a similar reservation.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week.""

A number of political advisers have urged the White House to release it, with full knowledge of the diplomatic concerns cited by Mnuchin and Pompeo over the weekend.

""Otherwise, it looks like we're hiding something far more nefarious,"" one person said.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, publicly urged Trump to publish the transcript on Monday and hinted the White House could do so in the days ahead.

""I would just urge the President ... to release as much as possible. And here's what I think -- I think you're going to find (out) more about that phone call in the coming days,"" Graham said during on appearance on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. ""You're going to be surprised about the level of transparency regarding that phone call.""

One senior administration official said there's an understanding inside the White House that the timing of the administration's suspension of the Ukraine aid, which came around the time of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, ""lends to a question of what was going on.""

But this official, like the President, insists there was no quid pro quo.

Trump himself told reporters yesterday while leaving the White House that he wants to release the call. But he later said one way to release the call, given concerns about protecting American interests, would be to ""give it to a respected source.""

He said in Houston on Sunday that if the call was released, people would ""see one of the finest, one of the nicest"" conversations."

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn.

In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower's complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.

""We will have no choice,"" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report.

During the flight, Pelosi read a Washington Post op-ed from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.

She said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president's actions ""represent an impeachable offense.""

""It will be a big week,"" Pelosi said.

The reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it's still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.

Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even after President Donald Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.

That's why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday's high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump's conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint.

Plus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond -- particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts -- to see if it's time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.

The House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.

""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,"" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening.

'When are Democrats going to get tough?'

The impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.

Democrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.

That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.

""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday.

""This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?"" Connolly said. ""We are looking weak.""

So far, as many as 137 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according a CNN count -- more than half the caucus and with dozens having joined in the past two months. But that number is still far below a majority of House members and Pelosi has long warned of the political consequences of taking such a step against the Presidents.

Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on ""Newsroom"" Monday, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said if Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry.

""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.

New subpoena threat

The new comments from Democratic lawmakers Monday comes as three House committees threatened to subpoena the State Department over ""documents the State Department has been withholding in response to a letter the Chairmen sent two weeks ago relating to efforts by the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to solicit the help of a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 Presidential Election."" Three chairmen -- House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings -- authored a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,"" the three chairmen wrote jointly. ""Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.""

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former vice president in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

On Friday, Ratajkowski — who frequently posts pictures of her private jet escapades — tweeted, “The problem is plastic straws it’s corporate greed #globalclimatestrike,” despite the fact that over “90 percent of the planet’s plastic waste comes Asia and Africa” and “straws in the United States account for about 0.03 percent of global plastic pollution,” as Breitbart News reported.

However, as of Monday morning, the tweet was unavailable. It remains unclear what prompted the left-wing activist to delete the message.

As Breitbart News noted, Ratajkowski has demonstrated a stunning ability to put her climate change concerns aside to boast of her excessive air travel on social media. For example, this month, Ratajkowski posted a series of pictures of herself, posing on private jets:

The I Feel Pretty actress is also an advocate of JetSmarter, which some have called the “Uber of air travel.”

“It’s the ‘first global digital marketplace for private aviation’ which makes booking flights on private jets a breeze for carbon footprint producing celebrities like Ratajkowski,” as Breitbart News reported.

This is not the first time a celebrity has demonstrated climate change hypocrisy. Over the summer, many high-profile guests drastically increased their CO2 emissions by flying across the globe to attend the “Google Summer Camp” to discuss climate change.

As Breitbart News reported:

Traditionally held every year at the end of July, the famed Verdura Resort hosts the top-secret gathering, with the three-day summer camp costing the tech giant some $20 million, sources told the Post. Many of the guests, including Obama and DiCaprio — who has his own climate change foundation — have described global warming as the biggest threat to future generations. Forbes reports numerous yachts are currently moored off the beach at Verdura Resort having discharged their passengers; German pharmaceutical titan Udo J. Vetter’s sailing yacht Aquarius, Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg’s sailing yacht EOS, Graeme Hart’s yacht Ulysses with others en route including David Geffen’s yacht Rising Sun, Google’s Eric Schmidt’s yacht Infinity and its support vessel Intrepid, among them. According to Italian press reports, the attendees were also expected to show up in 114 private jets, of which 40 had arrived by Sunday.

Over the weekend, 17 Democrat candidates – most of whom have deemed climate change an emergency – attended the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Iowa Saturday, which featured 10,500 steaks. Clips show the candidates dancing and even playing an active role in grilling steak, despite several of them expressing concern on beef consumption and its role in contributing to the “catastrophe”:

""As soon as I saw that he had recommended it be sent to Congress, that's all I needed to know it was legit,"" said Mary McCord, the senior litigator from Practice at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who worked with Atkinson at the US Attorney's Office and DOJ's National Security Division.

Several officials who acknowledged they are skeptical of the complaint told CNN the IC IG, Michael Atkinson, is a serious professional and that his recommendation gives them pause when they would have been inclined to dismiss the case otherwise.

Atkinson is widely regarded as a career non-partisan with little interest in the public limelight but he currently finds himself at the center of the high profile controversy related to whether the whistleblower complaint

His recommendation that the complaint, which Atkinson says raised allegations of ""urgent concern,"" be shared with lawmakers has fueled the escalating standoff between the director of national intelligence and Congress while Trump has continued to publicly question the whistleblower's motives for speaking out.

But Atkinson has stood by his conclusion that the complaint indeed raises concerns that must be handed over to Congress in accordance with the law, despite clashing with his own boss, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over that determination.

The House Intelligence Committee released a letter from Atkinson last week in which he wrote that he and Maguire, ""are at an impasse"" over that point, marking an unprecedented disagreement between the DNI and IC IG.

""This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday.

Appointed as IC IG by Trump in 2018, Atkinson's long-standing reputation as a straight-shooter with professional integrity has bolstered the legitimacy of the whistleblower complaint despite the President's attempts to paint it as a partisan attack, multiple sources have told CNN.

Credible sense of urgency

Prior to his Senate confirmation to become IC IG in 2018, Atkinson worked for the Justice Department for over 15 years, according to his biography on the ODNI website

From 2002 through 2006, Atkinson worked as a trial attorney in DOJ's Criminal Division, Fraud Section. He then served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2016, where he was the acting chief and deputy chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section.

Some of Atkinson's former colleagues agreed that his credentials as a non-partisan and relative obscurity prior to becoming involved in the whistleblower case lend weight to the seriousness of the complaint.

Atkinson brought several major cases to the US Attorney's Office that were ""the result of thorough, quiet investigation,"" according to McCord, who served as the acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ from 2016 to 2017 and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division from 2014 to 2016.

That quiet, non-partisan approach to his work is why McCord believed he would be a good fit for the IC IG role.

""The mere fact he was not on anyone's radar is points to the fact that his sense of urgency is credible,"" she said. ""People don't know who he is and that's because he does his job. He's the IG and most of that work is not in the public sphere.""

""You would not know which political party he favors by working with him. I worked with him for years. That's the other reason I feel he's so credible in this space,"" McCord added.

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, told CNN that Atkinson is ""someone who is very deliberate, thoughtful and tries to carefully review facts ... not someone who seeks attention.""

""So if he is in a situation where something needed to be referred that's because it was his best and informed view of what the law required,"" he said.

Not backing down?

McCord told CNN that she believes Atkinson feels strongly that the complaint needs to be reported to Congress but is also trying to respect the hierarchy in place, which includes the DNI.

During a closed-door briefing with Schiff's committee on Thursday, Atkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower's concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

The inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details.

Although the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing.

According to one source, Atkinson referenced ""a sequence of events"" and ""alleged actions"" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim.

The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with a July call between Trump and Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

While Trump and some Congressional Republicans have attempted to downplay concerns surrounding the complaint, McCord told CNN that she does not see Atkinson backing down from his position.

""If he got to a position where he saw resigning as the only alternative, he would do it ... but there is a lot of space between now and that point,"" McCord added, noting that Maguire is still expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday."

(CNN) After a brief cessation of hostilities against the United States' intelligence and law enforcement community, President Donald Trump is once again gearing up to do battle. He is dusting off his old playbook and employing many of the same tactics he relied on to counter past allegations of wrongdoing.

The question this week is whether the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, abused the power of the executive office to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, making him a political rival of the President.

Reports of Trump's conversations with the Ukrainian president come as a whistleblower from the intelligence community has filed an official complaint with the inspector general related to the call, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN.

The inspector general concluded that the whistleblower complaint was ""credible"" and ""urgent"" — a level of seriousness that requires the Justice Department to notify Congress. The IG followed this protocol by forwarding the whistleblower's report to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, who has refused to share it with Congress. On Monday, Trump laid into the government whistleblower, questioning the person's nationality and suggested that it is anti-American to report suspected abuses by a president.

In short, the executive branch is blocking the whistleblower's information from getting to Congress, even though the law is clear that such notification is mandatory in cases of this sort. For his part, the IG says the executive branch is keeping him from doing his job.

Only two months have passed since Special Counsel Robert Mueller appeared before Congress, concluding a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Although many people have gone to prison over charges stemming from the special counsel's probe , no one was ultimately charged with conspiracy with Russia, despite at least one documented attempt by Team Trump to accept political dirt from a foreign adversary.

During the course of Mueller's investigation, the President and his allies engaged in a full-throated assault on the institutions of power that were investigating Trump's inner circle, working to discredit the men and women charged with safeguarding America against foreign threats.

As I write in my new book, ""Crossfire Hurricane: Inside Donald Trump's War on the FBI,"" the President blamed investigators for conducting a ""witch hunt,"" and for being ""deep state"" operatives working to undermine his presidency. Without evidence, he claimed the FBI had inserted a ""spy"" into his campaign for sinister political purposes and castigated former President Barack Obama for allegedly ordering the wiretapping of Trump Tower.

Many national security experts, including me, believe Trump's goal in these baseless attacks was to help soften the blow of whatever might eventually come from Mueller's findings.

In the latest scandal, involving Trump's dealings with Ukraine, the President is drawing from the same playbook he used in his earlier attacks against the intelligence community: initially claim no knowledge of allegations of wrongdoing, eventually deny those allegations, claim that whatever was originally being described was actually innocent, and then wage war against those doing the investigating.

During the Russia investigation, Trump and his allies insisted that Mueller and his team were partisan operatives with an agenda, even though the key players involved in that case -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director James Comey, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and even Mueller himself -- were all Republicans

President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal, publicly blasting the whistleblower as a "" partisan ,"" even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The president denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been ""beautiful."" And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as "" the Ukraine witch hunt .""

As I have tried to warn the public ever since Trump's initial attacks on the FBI and Justice Department during the Russia probe, the President's efforts to undermine our institutions of justice pose real consequences to public safety. For example, FBI agents and intelligence officers rely on the public to help gather leads and serve as informants. A lack of public trust might mean fewer people will come forward to help guard against threats.

Furthermore, US intelligence agencies have the life-and-death responsibility of advising policymakers on serious threats to US national security. Political attacks on these agencies' credibility will only serve to undermine their effectiveness in the eyes of lawmakers and the public they serve. If any president destroys that precious trust with the American people for nefarious political purposes, that president risks undermining democracy.

Trump may be lashing out because he has been backed into a corner, but publicly degrading people inside the intelligence community because their good-faith efforts threaten his political survival is no excuse for the war he wages.

As I write in my book, we have seen real intelligence abuses in the past. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and CIA engaged in gross violations of civil liberties in the name of national security. Innocent Americans were wiretapped without court authorization and spied on, as intelligence bureaus sought to determine their national and political allegiances.

What followed was systematic and wholesale reformative change by lawmakers once these abuses came to light. Congress passed new laws rein in the intelligence community and ensure effective oversight by the legislative branch. The distrust in intelligence and law enforcement in the wake of those scandals has taken decades to reverse.

Since announcing his presidential campaign, the former vice president has refused to discuss the ties his youngest son, Hunter, has cultivated overseas. Biden has remained silent on the topic, even though there is increasing evidence such dealings were made easier because of his political influence. As Peter Schweizer, a contributing editor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book— Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden profited off extraordinary deals that were unavailable to regular citizens.

In Ukraine, alone, the younger Biden secured a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of the country’s only independent oil and natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014. Hunter Biden received the position, which reportedly paid as much $83,000-a-month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry. Around the same time as the appointment, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Hunter Biden’s appointment and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption is at the center of the push for impeachment. Democrats claim that President Donald Trump allegedly broke the law by suggesting to the newly elected-president of Ukraine, Volodymr Zelensky, that he probe Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma.

The president has defended his conduct publicly, pointing out the inconsistencies and contradictions both Joe and Hunter Biden have told on the topic.

“The conversation I had was largely … [about] all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,” the president said on Saturday."

The former vice president made the announcement shortly after House Democrats signaled they would begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump for urging Ukraine’s government to probe Hunter Biden’s business dealings.

“If President Trump refuses to comply with congressional requests, then he “will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said, before refusing to address questions from reporters. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the natural gas company’s board of directors in April 2014, where he was purportedly paid more $83,000 a month, despite having no prior background in the energy industry.

At the same time, Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. More troubling is that the former vice president pressured the Ukrainian government in 2016 to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was known to be investigating the energy giant.

Given the appearance of a conflicts of interest and the contradicting stories Joe and Hunter Biden have spun on the topic, Trump has defended his calls for Ukraine to investigate.

Trump said on Saturday:

The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems.

Shortly before the former vice president drew the line in the sand on impeachment, Trump announced he would release the un-redacted transcript of his call with Ukraine’s newly-elected president. The released documents, however, are only likely to draw more scrutiny to the unanswered questions about the reasoning for Hunter Biden’s appointment to Burisma’s board of directors.

As evidenced by the former vice president’s decision to avoid the press on Thursday, such answers are likely not forthcoming.

Since announcing his presidential campaign, the former vice president has refused to discuss his son’s business ties to either Ukraine or China, despite mounting evidence such dealings were made easier because of his political influence. As Peter Schweizer detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden made a lucrative profit off extraordinary deals that were unavailable to regular businessmen.

“I mean, you look at — around the world, there are two countries where Joe Biden is the point person for the Obama administration: China and Ukraine, and in both cases, his son lands huge deals in both countries.

“If you look back at Joe Biden’s history of running for national office, he’s been in a safe seat in Delaware since 1972, so he doesn’t get challenged on these issues,” said Schweizer of Biden’s false public statements. “Whenever he runs for national office, he comes up with these stories that are supposed to indicate some level of truth and what kind of person he is, but he always sort of exaggerates, and he even does it with some of the worst stories.”

Schweizer continued, “Everybody is familiar with the tragic story of [Joe Biden being] elected to the Senate and then his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident — and there’s a lot of reporting on this by some news outlets — of how the original [and] accurate story is that this driver sort of lost control of his car and this tragedy happened, and the man responsible for this accident felt haunted about it for the rest of his life. Well, over the course of decades, Joe Biden has added the fact — which is completely false — that this guy was a drunk driver, so he’s even taken a tragedy involving his family to try to make it seem more favorable to him.”

“The victim narrative,” replied Marlow, describing Biden as seeking political advantage through misrepresenting personal tragedy.

Shweizer concluded, “[Joe Biden] does the same thing with these embellishments involving ‘Corn Pop‘ or whoever else.”

“It’s pathological,” determined Marlow. “These guys are all such liars. This guy is a serial liar and we act like [Donald Trump] is the first one who’s ever told a fib in all of Washington.”

LISTEN:

In January, Politico described Biden’s public misrepresentation of the facts surrounding the deaths of his first wife and daughter as part of a pattern of “gaffes” in which he “altered the narrative”:

Some of [Joe Biden’s] confidants [claim] that Biden’s grief contributed to his propensity for impolitic, loose-lipped gaffes—life is short, let it rip—including two public instances in which he altered the narrative of the deadly wreck by suggesting inaccurately the other driver was drunk. Overall, though, and over time, Biden has managed to turn his grief into a sort of interpersonal gift. … In 2001, the week following the September 11 attacks, Biden gave a speech at the University of Delaware to a crowd of more than 2,700. He told them to not be afraid. He told the students their generation was up to the task to fight this fight. And he grieved for the people who had gotten a call saying their loved ones were dead, just like that, there in the morning, now gone forever. Once, he said, he had gotten that call. “It was an errant driver who stopped to drink instead of drive and hit—a tractor-trailer—hit my children and my wife and killed them,” he said. Six years later, in a very different context, in Iowa for a second attempt at running for president, he relayed a similar rendering of the accident. “Let me tell you a little story,” he said to a quiet crowd in Iowa City. “ … a guy who allegedly—and I never pursued it—drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch, broadsided my family … ” The problem was it wasn’t true. The driver of the truck, Curtis C. Dunn of Pennsylvania, was not charged with drunk driving. He wasn’t charged with anything. The accident was an accident, and though the police file no longer exists, coverage in the newspapers at the time made it clear that fault was not in question. For whatever reason, Neilia Biden, who was holding the baby, ended up in the right of way of Dunn’s truck coming down a long hill.

The Newark Post highlighted Biden’s false claims regarding the details of the aforementioned car accident:

According to Delaware Superior Court Judge Jerome O. Herlihy, who oversaw the police investigation 36 years ago as chief prosecutor, there is no evidence supporting Biden’s claim. “The rumor about alcohol being involved by either party, especially the truck driver (Dunn), is incorrect,” Herlihy said recently. … Biden has been alluding to alcohol being involved in the crash for nearly a decade. During a speech in 2001, Biden told an audience at University of Delaware that a drunken driver crashed into his family. He told a similar story during a public appearance in 2007.

No charges were made against Curtis C. Dunn, the driver of the tractor trailer Neilia Biden crashed into.

The president redirected every question about his decision to suspend aid to Ukraine, and his conversations with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, to question the Biden family and their actions in the country.

“There was never any quid pro quo,” he said, referring to the aid. “Unlike Biden, who by the way what he said was a horror.”

The president pointed at Biden’s son Hunter, who made $50,000 a month while serving on a Ukranian energy board while the former Vice President used threats of withdrawing aid to force the firing of a prosecutor which was also investigating the company paying his son.

“Ask how his son made millions of dollars from Ukraine, millions of dollars from China even though he had no expertise whatsoever,” Trump said.

The president spoke about the issue during a bilateral meeting with United Kingdom Prime Minster Boris Johnson.

Trump commented as a growing number of House Democrats joined calls to impeach the president for abuse of power, driving a narrative that Trump suspended aid to Ukraine to force leaders in the country to investigate Biden.

The president said that he suspended aid to Ukraine, because he felt that other countries should help pay for their aid, not just the United States.

“Why is the United States the only one paying to Ukraine?” Trump asked. “Why isn’t it Germany? … Why isn’t it France?”

The president said he finally consented to deliver the aid to Ukraine after aids and allies urged him to act.

He reminded the press that he sent the best military aid to Ukraine, as they faced threats from Russia-backed forces.

“President Obama used to send pillows and sheets, I sent anti-tank weapons and a lot of things to Ukraine,” Trump said.

Earlier in the day, Trump responded to a growing number of Democrats calling for his impeachment, accusing him of abusing his power to investigate political opponents.

“I think it’s ridiculous. It’s a witch hunt. I’m leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me. The only way they can try is through impeachment,” he replied."

ALISYN CAMEROTA: And is that Joe Biden’s fault or problem?

BREMMER: No, but it’s hard to imagine Joe Biden wasn’t aware of it. And I expect that President Obama, if he had known about the reality of this situation, would have probably told Biden, “Get rid of this. Like, we shouldn’t have your son working in this situation.” That would have cost him something. I feel that even if Biden wasn’t aware, but Biden should have been aware that would cause an issue for him."

Jim Himes (D-CT) on Monday.

“I mean extorting a foreign leader for the purposes of getting that leader to do your political work to try to find dirt on your opponent is extortion,” Himes said during an interview on CNN’s New Day.

“Of course, it’s an impeachable offense,” he concluded.

On Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) echoed Himes’ statement in a tweet, stating it would be “troubling” if the president were to request that Zelensky investigate Biden.

“If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” he wrote.

Himes and Romney’s comments come after a whistleblower alleged in a Wall Street Journal report that the president urged Zelensky during a July phone call to look into Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, and his business dealings in Ukraine.

The report stated:

“He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know” whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said. Mr. Trump didn’t mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, said this person, who didn’t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on an investigation.

However, congressional Republicans recently defended President Trump against the accusations.

“It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Saturday. “Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out — Whoa, different story! This seems to be the same kind of deal.”

On Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, president of the Government Accountability Institute, Peter Schweizer, said the media are trying to make it look like a Biden scandal is actually a Trump scandal.

Schweizer commented:

What’s interesting about this is that Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas or anything like that, but of course his father, the vice president at the time, was the point person on U.S. policy towards Ukraine, and the money we’re talking about here is eye-popping. Hunter Biden was getting $83,000 a month from this Ukrainian energy company where he had no background.

“So the immediate question becomes, he’s not selling his expertise — because he has none in this field — what is he getting paid for?” he concluded."

Trump’s opponents have cried “quid pro quo” for Trump insisting on information regarding the younger Biden in exchange for foreign aid designated for Ukraine.

“I don’t know that this is the way it went, but my guess is, ‘You guys want your $250 million? OK, send us the Biden file on how all that money went out of there and what was going on in there, what that was all about, and you got yourselves a deal,'” he said. “That is called politics.”

“That is called a quid pro quo,” Clift said.

“What do you think happens every day in this city?” Buchanan said. “[L]yndon Johnson — you want a dam out there in Idaho, you better vote for the war.”

According to Buchanan, this appeared to be the latest chapter in the “Deep State-media alliance” going against Trump.

“Behind this all is what?” Buchanan said. “It is the Deep State-media alliance in this city, which is resisting and attempting to overthrow the government the American people have imposed upon them. Issue after issue it is the same thing and involves these two warring factions in this city.”

He predicted this would backfire on Biden’s candidacy because it would raise questions about Biden’s son.

“Let me tell you who is going to be the loser here: It’s going to be Joe Biden because all this stuff — if it goes to the Hill, people are going to say, ‘What is he talking about, Biden and Ukraine? What happened over there? What did Hunter Biden do? Let’s get all those details out. You get the Freedom Caucus — they’ll be all over this.”

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president.

Transcript as follows:

MARK LEVIN, AUTHOR “UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS”: My take is the Biden family is corrupt. My take is that Joe Biden obstructed justice. You want to find obstruction. There it was. My take is that he blackmailed that government to get that prosecutor removed. And not just to protect his son, but to protect his future running for President of the United States.

And you have a massive Democrat scandal here. That’s why the media are conducting themselves the way they are. That’s why the Democrats are trying to turn this insight out to immunize Biden and to attack Trump but it won’t work. You see, Trump came into office a very, very rich man, and he’ll leave office a very, very rich man.

Joe Biden came in a very poor man. And then he left office a very rich man as did his family. Look how the media have covered this. First, we heard that Trump pressured Ukrainian President to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and held up military aid. The Wall Street Journal says, “well, not exactly.” Trump pressured the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, but there was no quid pro quo.

Then, we get the whistle-blower complaint being withheld from Congress. And Nancy Pelosi is very angry about that, that’s great. That takes us to impeachment territory. Justice Department and the DNI say, “No.” There we find out really there is no whistle-blower. There is some guy who heard something or read something but wasn’t in on the President’s conversation.

By the way, I am sick and tired of this President’s conversation with foreign leaders been leaked to the media and Democrats on Capitol Hill. I don’t remember a damn one of those happen at all to Obama or any other President. Our President has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place.

Now, Ukraine, through their foreign minister, denies that Trump pressured them. But you see it doesn’t fit their narrative. Now, let’s take a look at what took place with Biden. By the way, we need a Special Counsel. I have an idea. We should appoint a Special Counsel and make sure all the assistant special councils either donated to the Trump campaign or worked into the Trump campaign because only then will we have an honest investigation.

Make sure the issue of really thick report. That’s what they should to do. Exhibit one, our buddy Peter Schweizer, this is April 16, 2014, Devin Archer Hunter Biden’s business partner made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with the Vice President Biden. Five days later, Biden landed in Kia for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials.

Soon thereafter, the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund found more than a billion dollars into the Ukrainian economy. The next day a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, the fist went Hunter Biden would join the board. Hunter Biden has no background in energy, no background in anything really, other than being the son of a Vice President and other things of that sort.

Now, that’s exhibit one. Exhibit two. This is from The Washington Examiner. John Kerry’s stepson. Oh, it was precious to see John Kerry on TV Sunday attacking Trump, defending Biden when his own stepson has something to answer for it too.

His stepson rushed to play damage control to State Department after his business partner, Hunter Biden sealed the incestuous relationships, cut a deal with oligarch owned Ukrainian Gas Company in 2014, the one we just mentioned. An email released to The Washington Examiner shows that Biden’s decision to join the board of this Ukrainian company sparked immediate concern within his inner circle about the political optics.

Biden’s father, Joe was then Vice President, so they’re very concerned of this point. We have our friend, John Solomon; Biden had made no mention of his son and his 2018 speech that you saw in the video there where he says he stepped in. Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board was rightly reported. So in other words, everybody knew it.

Now, I could go on and on and on. But here’s the deal. Here’s my problem. Where the hell are the Republicans in the Senate? Do you know we control the Senate? Do you know how we control the Senate Intelligence Committee?

Our good friend Lindsey Graham, are you not Chairman to the Senate Judiciary Committee? Then why the hell aren’t you issuing subpoenas like Elijah Cummings? Why the hell aren’t you issuing subpoenas like Jerry Nadler and all the rest of them? Why aren’t you getting to the bottom of this? You have real live corruption, obstruction, blackmail that’s what Ukraine. Wait till we get to China $1.5 Billion. I don’t care what the media thinks. See that over my shoulder? “Unfreedom of the Press”.

We know that they’re incapable of covering this because of their ideology. But the truth shall set us free. I understand what the Democrats are doing in the House. I understand. They want to destroy the President. They are using their committee as opposition research. They are settling the wagon they’re trying to immunize Biden.

What’s going on in the Republican Senate? Subpoenas, under oath testimonies. Why don’t you issue subpoenas for the Biden bank accounts like they do with Trump? Or call in his accounts like they do with Trump? Or Hunter Biden, we can’t touch him but Don, Jr., and Eric and Jerry Kushner and Ivanka? They are free game? Hell, no. We should turn the script. Here’s the difference. Biden is corrupt. Trump is not."

Schweizer highlighted the Jeff Bezos-owned news media outlet’s broad omissions in reporting on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings during his father’s tenure as vice president.

“If you are a reader of the Washington Post, and that is really your main source of news, you would have absolutely no idea what this whole Biden thing and his son thing is about, because they’re never really reported anything on it,” Schweizer said, noting that “a lot of news outlet’s” similarly ignore findings related to the Biden family’s foreign businesses. “They’ve never reported on the massive deals that Hunter Biden got in China.”

Schweizer noted Hunter Biden’s salary while sitting on the board of director of Burisma, a Ukraine-based energy company. “They have done very little reporting on the Ukraine controversy and what it entails. The dollar amount — the $83,000 a month — which we know … from court documents. Hunter Biden’s business partner was charged with fraud in an unrelated case, so it’s all there in black and white how much he was getting paid, but none of that is reported by the media. You have to ask yourself, ‘Why?’. These are news outlets. This is news, that the vice president of the United States’ son is cashing in in a major way in two countries around the world that are central to U.S. foreign policy while his dad is vice president. You don’t think readers are interested in that? It’s mind-boggling to me from the standpoint of the black hole of news coverage by some news outlets on this subject is astonishing to me.”

LISTEN:

“It’s very legitimate to look into activities [and] self-enrichment taking place while Joe Biden — in his official duties — was vice president of the United States,” determined Schweizer. “That’s something that should not be just written off because people think it’s inconvenient, or politically motivated. Let’s just get the facts out, follow the money, and see exactly what happened.”

Many news media outlets marketing themselves as non-partisan and politically objective operate double standards based on partisan political considerations, observed Schweizer. “Imagine looking forward, say in 2025, we have a Democratic president … and somebody were to argue or allege that one of the Trump children got a beneficial deal. That individual would probably be hailed as a hero for wanting that to be looked into, but for some reason there are different standards for different people.”

“They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal,” Schweizer said last week of the Washington Post‘s and other news media outlets’ framing of an alleged “whistleblower.”

Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father directed $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine as vice president during the Obama administration.

Hunter Biden also consummated financial relationships with foreign states and oligarchs in China and Ukraine while his father “steered [foreign] policy” towards those two countries as vice president, noted Schweizer in May.

In August, Schweizer explained how Hunter Biden helped facilitate China’s acquisition of Henniges Automotive — a formerly America-based company developing “dual-use” technologies with military applications — by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-run military contractor. AVIC acquired Henniges in 2015 with a 51 percent stake purchase. The remaining 49 percent was purchased by Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), a private equity firm founded by Hunter Biden and funded with $1.5 billion from the Chinese government via the Bank of China.

Bill Weld (R-MA) reacted to the report that President Donald Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, and his business dealings.

Weld said “it couldn’t be clearer” that what Trump did was “treason pure and simple” because Joe Biden is a presidential candidate.

“Well, obviously, canceling primaries undermines democratic institutions and democratic elections, but that’s far from the deepest high crime the president has committed here,” Weld told host Joe Scarborough. “He’s now acknowledged that in a single phone call right after he suspended $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, he called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden, who the president thinks is going to be running against him.”

“Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,” he continued. “It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions — that is treason. It’s treason pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty. The penalty on the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.”

Smith said, “There is no known evidence that Joe Biden did anything wrong. The whole thing involved corruption in the Ukraine. A corrupt prosecutor who much of the world was pressuring the Ukraine to remove. Earlier this year the Ukrainian officials said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son, Hunter.”

He added, “The real issue here is a phone call. The claim that the president pressured a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and the failure to pass the whistleblower complaint to Congress. Now, among Democrats, the pressure to impeach this president is building. The top Democrat in Congress, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is warning the White House that refusal to hand over the whistleblower complaint could be a ‘grave new chapter of lawlessness’ by the White House and wrote that it could lead to a whole new stage of the investigation.”

The expected announcement comes as more than two-thirds of House Democrats now say they support impeachment in light of President Trump confirming that he suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky probe Hunter Biden during a congratulatory telephone call in July. Pelosi will reportedly announce the new inquiry after the Democratic caucus’ meeting at 4:00 p.m. EST.

Earlier Tuesday, President Trump said he ordered White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold tens of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine a week before he telephoned Kiev’s leader.

Before making his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Tuesday, the president told reporters he gave the order because he felt other allied nations weren’t providing enough.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

While still at the United Nations, President Trump later announced that he would release the full transcript of his phone call with Zelensky.

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” the president tweeted.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!” he added.

Though numerous congressional Democrats are now demanding an impeachment inquiry to be opened due to the Trump-Zelensky call, it remains unclear if the president broke the law by asking for an inquiry to be made into the Biden family. Further, the alleged “whistleblower” who reportedly claims to possess knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky, did not hear the pair’s conversation first hand.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham hit out at reports regarding Pelosi’s expected announcement, saying in a statement “the Democrats continue to weaponize politics when they should be working on behalf of their constituents, which is nothing new.”

“President Trump is working hard on behalf of our country here in NYC while they continue to scream the word impeachment. Nothing new here,” added Grisham.

UPDATE — 4:55 p.m. EST: According to Politico, Pelosi told Democrats during Tuesday’s caucus meeting: “It would be my intention with the consent of this caucus … to proceed with an impeachment inquiry. He is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign, that is a betrayal of his oath of office.”

UPDATE — 5:07 p.m. EST: At a Capitol Hill press conference House Speaker Pelosi officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump: “The House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry. The President must be held accountable; no one is above the law,” she said.

She continued, “I was trying to compare it to something in our life. He really was withholding the money, saying he was wanted Paris — he wanted France and Germany to pay for it. Why didn’t he tell Congress at the time that was the reason why? But if you have a boss that says, go do something for me, something that you don’t want to do, you know that they hold the cards, that if you don’t do it, you risk not getting paid, you risk getting fired.

A partial transcript is as follows:

THE ATLANTIC’S JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Is according to what we’re getting on the screen — there’s a little bit of what you might call now a breaking tweet from the president — who says that tomorrow they will release a transcript of the Zelensky call. So my question to you is, if you see that transcript and it’s more benign than we’re lead to believe, do you think that your caucus might stand down a little bit or do you think the caucus is at a boil right now?

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: No, it’s not about. This is about the constitution of the United States. We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public. It’s really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid pro quo in the conversation.

If the president brings up, he wants them to investigate something of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right. We don’t ask foreign governments to help us in our elections. That’s what we try to stop with Russia. It’s wrong. It’s not only about how to make decisions about our foreign policy and global security, it’s about undermining the integrity of our election.

I don’t think there’s a — I don’t know. I don’t think there’s a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense, but if you have sequencing, like a couple of days before the President withdrew the bipartisan support for Ukraine. Bipartisan enthusiastic support for Ukraine a few days earlier, he withdraws it, then makes this statement.

President’s words weigh tons. And just bringing up the election is bad enough. That there would be a quid pro quo isn’t necessarily in the conversation, but in the sequencing. So this is not a good thing for a democracy, for the leader of the free world to be talking like that, and I don’t even know if there are any scruples involved. That’s why I say they think lawlessness is a virtue and now want to export it to another country."

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” he wrote on Twitter.

The president announced his decision as more House Democrats meet to discuss impeachment proceedings to check what they believe is an unprecedented abuse of executive power. Some House Democrats, such as Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), have already made up their minds to support impeachment.

Since an anonymous “whistleblower” made public allegations that Trump acted inappropriately in a call with Ukraine by asking about investigating his potential opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, Democrats have demanded further details about his conversation.

But Trump says he had nothing to hide.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” he wrote.

Establishment media and Democrats are driving the narrative that the president purposefully withheld federal aid to Ukraine in an effort to strong-arm leaders into an investigation of the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden. Trump has denied the allegations.

Wallace said, “The fact is that President Trump and his staff have really said quite a lot since Sunday in trying to explain or defend what they did that puts a lot of meat on the bones. The fact that the president says that in that congratulatory phone call with the president-elect at that time of Ukraine, he did talk about Joe Biden. He did talk about Joe Biden and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concern about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that. We also know, because it was admitted today by Kellyanne Conway, the story that was on the front page of The Washington Post, that the president did ask acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, before he made that phone call in July, to stop the provision of military aid to Ukraine, which had been overwhelmingly passed by Congress that everyone seemed in the government to want and the president said that he wanted it to be stopped.”

He continued, “So the two parts of the basic story here — that the president wanted Biden investigated, and that he had previously stopped aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine — those have been confirmed by the administration. The president denies that it was a quid pro quo.”

He added, “It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there’s going to be something here for Congress to investigate, whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don’t know.”

According to an anonymous complaint revealed in reports last week, President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s son — Hunter Biden — and his business dealings in the eastern European country. However, according to CNN, the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications,” citing an official with knowledge of the matter.

On Sunday, Trump said his conversation with Zelensky was “largely congratulatory,” adding that he did mention how he doesn’t want people like Biden and his son contributing to “the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

Trump, speaking to reporters on the White House lawn before flying to Houston, also said he doesn’t believe the person who reported the call is a “whistleblower,” stating that “you can’t have people doing false alarms like this.”

“When the president speaks to the head of another country, he has to be able to speak to those people and those people don’t want to know that they’re being recorded or that you have a stenographer working,” he said. “You don’t want to have to hear that. You can’t do that to a president and you can’t do that to other countries.”

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko similarly dismissed the idea of any crime or scandal in Trump’s conversation with Zelensky. “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,” Prystaiko told Hromadske, a Ukrainian online broadcast outlet. “There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said Sunday that impeachment may be “the only remedy” as President Trump confirmed he discussed Biden and corruption with Ukraine’s president.

Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Schiff said he has been reluctant to join calls to impeach the president, but said the phone call would potentially be “the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office,” during this or any other presidency.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,” he said.

JOHN SOLOMON: While talking to senior U.S. diplomats today, overseas in Europe, I learned that on April 22, 2014, less than three weeks before the Burisma Holdings announced that Hunter Biden was joining their board, Vice President Joe Biden met with the prime minister of Ukraine. And in that meeting, according to a transcript, which I obtained tonight, Joe Biden specifically encouraged the Ukrainians to expand natural gas production with the help of Americans coming to the country. He set up the exact scenario that Hunter Biden just a few weeks earlier cashed in on.

SEAN HANNITY: Woah, this now takes things to a whole new level, because now, he’s basically doing the bidding for his own son’s wealth creation. Maybe even his son would share with his father.

SOLOMON: Those are the questions that Ukrainians are trying to answer back in 2016 before the prosecutor was fired, Sean. And they never got to the bottom of that. But I do think the evidence that the Ukrainians possess and would like to give to the U.S. Justice Department, it’s sitting there to be hand over. Someone from the Justice Department could pick it up tomorrow.

HANNITY: You also broke the story how Ukraine wanted to get us specific information about —

SOLOMON: Yes.

HANNITY: The Democratic National Committee, the Democrats, looking for Ukraine to help interfere in the 2016 elections. Tell us about that.

SOLOMON: That’s right. Yes, listen, the former ambassador to Ukraine, Ambassador Chaly — excuse me, the former Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Chaly told me on the record, in a statement that in the spring of 2016, a Democratic National Committee aide came to him, a contractor, and asked him to do two things. One, to turn over any intelligence they have in their intelligence files linking Donald Trump or Paul Manafort to Russia. And two, when Ukraine’s president came to visit the United States later in the year, in the middle of that 2016 election, they wanted him to make a statement.

HANNITY: Oh, wait a minute.

SOLOMON: Yes.

HANNITY: Well, so the Democrats were looking to get the Ukrainians to interfere in our elections.

SOLOMON: Before they were against it, they appeared to have been for it.

HANNITY: And they want to give us that information. All right. Peter Schweizer, let me go to you, if I may. You wrote Secret Empires. Fill in the gaps here from what you’ve heard from John, and also, you might want to add a little color to the story, which is Hunter Biden takes a trip to Asia with his father. And about 14 days after, he is doing a billion-dollar deal in private equity, and he has no background history with China or private equity, does he?

PETER SCHWEIZER: Yes, that’s right, Sean. I mean, what you see here is a pattern that emerged during the Obama administration. Joe Biden became point person to two countries, in particular, Ukraine and in China. And in both cases, his son cashed in. Ukraine, we’ve talked about, he was basically getting $83,000 a month as part of his consulting fee for Burisma, this corrupt energy company. In China, he travels with his father in December aboard Air Force Two. While his father is meeting with Chinese officials, Hunter Biden is doing we don’t know what. But the evidence becomes clear because ten days after they return to Washington, his small boutique investment firm, Rosemont Seneca, gets a $1 billion deal. That’s $1 billion with a “B,” later expanded to $1.5 billion. And that deal is with the Chinese government. It’s a deal that nobody else has in China. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, nobody.

HANNITY: So, this is 14 days after he flew with his dad on Air Force Two.

SCHWEIZER: Yes.

HANNITY: And well, can you confirm that he had no prior experience with Ukraine, oil, gas, or energy? Did he have any experience with China or private equity? Because I would think Goldman Sachs or one of the big banks would probably be a better candidate.

SCHWEIZER: Yes, I think they would, Sean. No background in China. He’s limited in private equity, was very limited. It was a hedge fund he was involved in with his uncle James Biden that ended up with massive lawsuits involving allegations of fraud. So, any experience he has in private equity is certainly not the type that the Chinese would have interested in. And the bottom line here, Sean, is that in both the case of Ukraine and China, we have paper trails. This is not like the Russian dossier, where somebody sort of said this is what happens. I know this is what happened. We have the financial records that Hunter Biden got from Ukraine. John has the ledger from Burisma itself. We know the visits."

Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

“I think it’s clear that a lot of [Democrat] policies — and particularly the stridency with which they are promoted — scare a lot of people, even the people who don’t like President Trump,” assessed Olsen.

LISTEN:



Olsen continued, “[Full-wokeness] would mobilize every Trump supporter to make sure they get out and vote, because the combination of economic policies and the cultural stridency unites every wing of the Trump coalition.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) record of supporting “full-woke” positions will become a political liability in a presidential election, determined Olsen.

“I have a hard time seeing how Warren can avoid that,” speculated Olsen. “She might want to campaign on the economy, but on the other hand, she’s already gone full-woke. She’s already called for reparations. She’s already said that the border should be decriminalized, [and] that there should be no such thing as illegal immigration. She’s already embraced radical positions on abortion.”

Olsen added, “It’s very hard to see how [Elizabeth Warren] avoids talking about that, because you know that the president and Republicans will remind her over and over and over again. I think she’s already stepped into that, so to speak, and it’s going to be hard for her to extricate herself.”

Trump’s greatest political threat is from a Democrat nominee who escapes “full-wokeness,” said Olsen.

“The most formidable opponent [for Donald Trump] is anyone who doesn’t scare the middle,” Olsen stated. “Right now, [Joe Biden] is avoiding full-wokeness. He’s talking about things in a way where he goes part of the way, but he doesn’t go all the way there.”

Joe Biden may move further left over the course of the Democrats’ presidential nomination process, noted Olsen.

“It’s not clear that the Biden we’re seeing now is the Biden we’re going to see in February,” Olsen said. “Will he move left — and sharply left — to get himself the nomination? I don’t know. And I think that if Biden does, then that — plus his notable penchant for gaffes and his obvious inability to maintain a steady debate performance across an entire two hours — will eventually be questions that voters will consider.”

Mansour highlighted a recent focus group of female swing voters examining Warren’s political appeal, inviting Olsen’s analysis on the Massachusetts senator’s likability.

Warren’s “demeanor,” arraigned Olsen, is unappealing to a broad swathe of the electorate.

“I’ve been watching the Democratic debates, and the thing that strikes me — as a former graduate of a well-ranked law school — is how much she reminds me of what she actually is, which is a law professor,” Olsen expressed.

Olsen continued, “The same demeanor of ‘the professor’s always right,’ staring straight out as if you were looking at a class with 200 students in it, and conducting the sort of pointed discussion that really doesn’t admit of discussion.”

Olsen went on, “Unfortunately, the election is not a classroom where students have to agree with you or be quiet. … In an election, people decide whether or not they like the person at the front of the room, and it doesn’t surprise me that a lot of people who don’t already agree with her positions — not just the populist positions, but the whole demeanor of ‘everything is awful and needs to be thrown upside down’ — [don’t] find her terribly attractive, particularly people who don’t have college degrees.”

We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019

Schiff’s announcement follows rumblings of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) intention to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump, using the alleged whistleblower’s accusations as a basis to formally launch the probe. As reported, the alleged whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation.

As Breitbart News reported:

It is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case. The alleged “whistleblower” in the case did not hear his conversations with Ukrainian leaders directly, and the Wall Street Journal has suggested there was no quid pro quo — that Trump did not offer (or withhold) anything in return.

Trump told reporters over the weekend that his conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was “largely congratulatory.”

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said of his conversation with Zelensky.

Trump announced on Tuesday that he authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted” transcript of the conversation.

Trump announced:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine……..You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared herself vindicated for being less than two percent Native American, the former Harvard University professor is leading in multiple state and national polls for the 2020 Democrat nomination for president.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Tapper and Schiff.

Stelter and Bernstein.

Dumb and Dumber.

Rinse, wash, repeat…

Welcome to another Russia Collusion Hoax flashback.

These idiots have no imagination, no self-awareness, and they are so exhausted by their own bullshit, so demoralized by loss after loss after loss, they can’t even come up with some fresh ideas or a new way to scream THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN ON THE ORANGE BAD MAN!

Late last week, I wrote about just how stupid this whistleblower scandal is. Now I regret pulling the trigger prematurely, because now that we know more, I underestimated just how stupid this whole thing really is.

The biggest piece of stupid is that even if Trump is guilty of the worst thing he is accused of… So what?

Think about this…

1) After President Obama made Vice President Joe Biden the White House’s point person on Ukraine, Joe Biden’s son, who has absolutely no background — meaning no skill or expertise — in the energy sector, was paid something like a million dollars from a Ukrainian energy company for his, uhm, expertise.

2) When the Ukraine government began to look into this obvious corruption, Biden threatened to withhold critical U.S. aid unless the government agreed to fire the prosecutor investigating his son, and we know this happened because Biden has been stupid enough to brag about it.

3) Trump asks Ukraine to look into all of this.

Here’s today’s big question… Out of those three, which one is a scandal? Bob, I’m going to go with door number one and door number two.

So that’s how the world turns if the scandal is accurate, and we already know it’s not.

Surprise, surprise, y’all — it’s Fake News!

Gee, who saw that coming — I mean, other than everyone.

To begin with, this so-called whistleblower didn’t even hear the phone call he or she is blowing the whistle on. In other words, it’s all hearsay and rumor.

And where does our fake news media hide this rather pertinent fact? In paragraph number 22, naturally.

We also have the Ukrainian foreign minister defending Trump, saying:

I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.

And there you go…

The dumbest part, though, is the political part…

Because the media no longer have any credibility with the public, politicians are no longer judged on these scandals. The public understands the media have an ax to grind and are completely unreliable, so whenever the next big scandal comes along, voters wisely roll their eyes.

What the public does look at, though, is how the politician in question handles the scandal, and if the politician is cool under fire, remains composed, and handles the media storm with savvy and skill, this can actually increase the respect the public have for this person. And so far, Trump is handling the “whistleblower” scandal beautifully, while Joe Biden is having public meltdowns.

Trump has remained calm, cool, confident, and on offense, while Biden, who is already a weak and vulnerable candidate with exploding eyes and loose teeth, looks rattled as he feigns being a tough guy.

Hirono on CNN’s “New Day” said there is sufficient “concrete evidence” to start an impeachment inquiry, adding it is different now that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is telling members of Congress the Ukraine report could bring about a new set of investigations.

“First, there needs to be an inquiry,” Hirono told host John Berman. “That’s why I’ve called for an impeachment inquiry or impeachment process. That’s different from impeachment in my view. First, you have to get the evidence, and then you decide whether or not you’re going to go ahead with impeachment proceedings after that.”

She continued, “I think there is more concrete evidence, and even if the president didn’t say, ‘Hey, by the way, leader of the Ukraine, you know, I’m holding back money so I’ll release it if you investigate Biden, my opponent, possible opponent.’ You know, you don’t have to have the president actually say that. The president knows that his conversations are monitored, but one should be able to connect the dots, and I think there is evidence.”

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

The new development, reported by Washington Post congressional correspondent Rachel Bade on Monday evening, comes in the wake of reports late last week that President Trump encouraged Ukrainian officials to re-open inquiries into the business dealings of former president Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Nevertheless, the story has given new enthusiasm to supporters of impeachment in the House Democratic caucus, who had been somewhat deflated after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion.

In July, the House voted 332-95 to postpone an impeachment resolution. As of last week, the Democrats only had 175 votes for impeachment from their 235 member — 43 votes short of the 218 necessary for a House majority. Almost all of the Democratic presidential contenders support impeachment, but only 37% of the public support it, while half oppose impeachment, according to the most recent Politico/Morning Consult poll released last week.

On Saturday, however, in the wake of the Ukraine story, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) — who enjoys unrivaled support among the “progressive” base — tweeted: “At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.” (She did not cite any law Trump had broken.)

On Monday, Politico reported that “Democratic all-stars” — including former Vice President Al Gore and other “alumni of the Clinton and Obama administrations” — were backing impeachment. NBC News quoted a “senior House Democratic aide” who said “[t]he dam could break on Thursday” for impeachment.

Pelosi had long resisted pressure to impeach the president, having seen the backlash that hit Republicans when they impeached President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Even though Clinton had committed actual crimes (obstructing justice and lying under oath), voters decided those did not amount to “high crimes and misdemeanors” — at least, not high enough to warrant reversing the results of a democratic election.

But on Monday, Bade reported, Pelosi had begun “sounding out members on impeachment, asking if the time has come.” Bade also reported that Democrats may use a “select committee” to conduct an impeachment inquiry, and not the contentious House Judiciary Committee run by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who has become a favorite Republican target.

Impeachment will not lead to President Trump’s removal from office unless the Senate votes to convict him by a two-thirds majority. Since Republicans have 53 seats, and Democrats (including independents who caucus with the Democrats) only have 47, the minority party would have to convince 20 Republicans — nearly half — to convict.

Media reports previewed that Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump after the president spoke to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky about investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for corruption.

The president told reporters that he had not heard of Pelosi’s looming decision, but called the ongoing investigation “the worst witch hunt in political history.”

But Trump added that voters would understand Democrats are overreaching.

“The good news is the voters get it,” he said. “This is why they say it’s good for the election, but you know what? It’s bad for the country, what she’s doing is very bad.”

Trump spoke to reporters at a meeting with Iraq President Barham Salih on Tuesday afternoon, calling the reports “crazy.”

The president said that Democrats continued efforts to force him out of office had seriously impaired the country’s ability to address serious issues.

“Then they all wonder why they don’t get gun legislation done, then they wonder why they don’t get drug prices lowered because all they do is talk nonsense,” Trump wrote. “No more infrastructure bills, no more anything. All they do, that’s all they do. … it’s the craziest thing anybody’s seen.”

Earlier Tuesday, Trump authorized a release of a transcript of the call with Zelensky to prove that there was nothing wrong said in the conversation.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” he wrote on Twitter.

He expressed surprise that Pelosi was willing to act, without even seeing the transcript of the call.

“I can’t even believe that it’s true,” he said. “How can you do this and you haven’t even seen the phone call?”

Pelosi is expected to announce her decision about impeachment proceedings after a 4:00 p.m. EST meeting with House Democrats on Tuesday.

Trump argued against impeachment, citing low unemployment numbers, a strong economy, and a rebuilt military under his presidency.

“The country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that she’d like to impeach,” he said.

Trump also cited a new Rasmussen poll on his popularity among likely voters at 53 percent and suggested that Democrats were reacting to fears that they would lose in 2020.

“Our country’s doing the best its ever done and they’re going to lose the election and they figured this is a thing to do,” he said.

Seth Moulton (D-MA) called for both President Donald Trump and Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh to be impeached.

The former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate argued on “CNN Newsroom” that Kavanaugh lied during his confirmation hearing and said Trump is using his office to “bribe a foreign leader” to attack former Vice President Joe Biden over his son’s business dealings in Ukraine.

In response to a clip of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) criticizing the constant calls of impeachment, Moulton told Rubio to “stop supporting people who lie.”

“Justice Kavanaugh lied in his confirmation hearing,” Moulton stated. “That’s why he should be impeached. The definition of impeachment for the president of the United States is treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Using the office of the presidency to bribe a foreign leader into attacking the former vice president of the United States, that fits into all three of those definitions.”

He continued, “So to Senator Rubio and other Republicans, how about remembering that oath to protect and defend the Constitution? He didn’t swear an oath to protect and defend his Republican president who happens to be good on Twitter. He swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. We all in Congress need to find the moral courage and the leadership to uphold that oath.”

Although Democrats have demanded that Trump release the transcript, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said after Trump’s tweet that it did not matter if the transcript was released and no quid pro quo was found, but rather, it was about the “sequencing” of his actions.

She said Tuesday:

There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that’s to — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right. You don’t ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That’s what we try to stop with Russia. It’s wrong. So it’s not only about how we make decisions about our foreign policy and our global security. It’s about undermining the integrity of our election.That’s A.

B: I don’t think there’s a — I don’t know. I don’t think there’s a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense, but if you have sequencing, like a couple of days before the President withdrew the bipartisan support for Ukraine. Bipartisan enthusiastic support for Ukraine a few days earlier, he withdraws it, then makes this statement. President’s words weigh tons. Weigh tons. And just bringing up the election is bad enough. That there would be a quid pro quo isn’t necessarily in the conversation, but in the sequencing. So this is not a good thing for a democracy, for the leader of the free world to be talking like that, and I don’t even know if there are any scruples involved. That’s why I say they think lawlessness is a virtue and now want to export it to another country.

Shortly after, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters Tuesday that what Trump “admitted to is already impeachable regardless of future developments.” She did not specify what she was referring to.

Some journalists and former Obama officials also demanded Trump release more, including an alleged whistleblower complaint made to the intelligence community inspector general about the call.

According to CNN, the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the details of the president’s call with Zelensky.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) tweeted that after Trump said he would release the transcript, “amazingly Democrats now say the whistleblower complaint is more important.”

He added, “Folks, the ‘whistleblower’ wasn’t on the call. They think a secondhand account of the call will tell you more than the *actual call.*”

Almost every other candidate has backed impeachment and urged the Democrat-run U.S. House of Representatives to start impeachment proceedings. On Tuesday, former vice president Joe Biden was said to back impeachment if Trump failed to comply with Congress.

Gabbard, however, has opposed impeachment in the past, and continues to do so. In early September, she said that it “will only further … tear our country apart.” And on Monday, Gabbard told Fox News that “I believe that impeachment, at this juncture, would be terribly divisive for this country.”

She also said that she would attend Tuesday’s caucus meeting at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time to discuss impeachment. In advance of that meeting, more Democrats have been coming out in favor of impeachment — including civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who is expected to inspire others to follow suit.

Separately, Gabbard qualified Tuesday for the third Democratic Party presidential primary debate in October. Though she reached the 130,000 donor threshold, Gabbard did not have the minimum poll numbers required to qualify for the September debate.

That changed after she castigated Trump harshly over potential U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in the wake of an attack, widely believed to have been launched by Iran, against Saudi oil facilities.

Update: Gabbard reiterated her opposition to impeachment on CNN on Tuesday: “I think it’s important Donald Trump is defeated. I believe I can defeat him in 2020. But it’s the voters who need to make that choice, unequivocally.”

A reasonable observer would have trouble finding anything President Donald Trump had done to meet that standard, but Democrats have a list of reasons:

1. They don’t like him! Democrats — and “Never Trump” Republicans — have been talking about impeachment since early 2016, arguing that since impeachment is an inherently political process they can do it for any reason.

2. He stole the 2016 election! Many Democrats still believe Trump cheated, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no collusion with Russia, and there is no evidence Russia affected significant numbers of votes.

3. He has business interests! Trump has businesses, such as hotels, that include foreign customers. Democrats claim that violates the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits accepting foreign gifts and titles.

4. He has violated the Constitution! Except… the Supreme Court has upheld almost every single Trump policy. (One rare exception: the Supreme Court struck down the Census citizenship question, but for procedural reasons.)

5. He colluded with the Russians! But: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

6: He obstructed justice! The Special Counsel “did not draw a conclusion one way or the other,” but the attorney general said there was insufficient evidence, and the White House withheld nothing from the investigation.

7. They need to find evidence! Democrats admit there is no evidence yet to impeach the president for anything, but that they can only get the information they need for impeachment once there is an impeachment inquiry. (Get that?)

8. He pushed Ukraine to investigate Biden! Joe Biden arguably obstructed justice by threatening to withhold U.S. aid to an ally unless it fired a prosecutor investigating his son. Trump urged an inquiry but offered no quid pro quo.

9. (Quietly: there may be no other way to beat him!) Trump’s approval rating is high; the economy is defying the recession hype; and the country is safe. Impeachment is a vote of no confidence in the 2020 Democratic field.

With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment.

A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority–they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges.

But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Via @mikedebonis and @rachaelmbade, Pelosi is now ""discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump.” https://t.co/PIxMZZeDzt — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 24, 2019

A House Democrat tells me it's ""very likely"" that Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry this afternoon and signal her own support for impeachment. — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 24, 2019

The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail–as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed–to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller’s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July.

But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed “whistleblower” against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine’s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now.

It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed “whistleblower” complaint about Trump’s call with Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet–and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States.

But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

What’s more, the supposed “whistleblower” technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said.

Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016–13 of which he won by more than six percent–with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process.

To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump–218 votes–Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed “moderate” Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents–to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating.

Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called “Squad” led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver’s seat in pushing the party’s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned.

Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment–ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee–saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.

Yes, this is an emergency. We don’t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 24, 2019

The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP’s view the Democrat Party–and all of its members–have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned.

Two supposedly “moderate” New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez.

New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement:

By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left’s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats.

They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)–both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump–are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment.

“Both Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,” John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “The Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.”

Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)–a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district, another battleground–is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters.

“Representative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,” John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania’s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “She’d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.”

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment.

“From his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,” Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. “Colorado’s 6th district won’t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.”

In Michigan, one of the op-ed’s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), joined the impeachment charade this week as well–and also are paying for it.

Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement:

Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents.

These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year’s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous.

“By pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president’s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. “They’re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don’t even seem to realize it.”

What’s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden’s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event.

But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country–including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden’s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)–a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream–has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada–leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner.

If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away–all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals–the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party’s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back–all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy.

“Despite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,” Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. “This round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats’ acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they’ll try impeachment instead.”"

Under fire, Trump has revived one of his favorite defensive tactics: trying to turn the spotlight onto his opponent.

Trump has made a series of allegations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden over the last week. The essence of Trump's argument is that Joe Biden was improperly trying to help Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the country's prosecutor general.

But there are significant holes in Trump's story. Some of his allegations have been false. Others have been missing important context.

Trump's missing context: What happened with the Ukrainian prosecutor

In castigating Biden's effort to get the prosecutor general fired, Trump has declined to mention an important fact: a whole lot of other people were also trying to get him fired at the time.

The Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists , among others, had all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general in 2015.

The International Monetary Fund warned Ukraine in February 2016 that it risked losing financial support if it did not clean up its act. The Financial Times explained in its article on the warning that then-President Petro Poroshenko was facing pressure to replace Shokin, whom the newspaper described as a ""long-time loyalist"" of the president; the article continued, ""Mr. Shokin has been criticized for failing to bring to justice any of the snipers who killed dozens of protesters in central Kiev in the final days of the revolution, and for dragging his feet over investigating senior officials and businesspeople.""

In a September 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, used blunt language in criticizing Shokin, blasting ""corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General's Office"" who were ""making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform."" Then, during a visit to Ukraine, Biden, who had long handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration , applied public and private pressure on the government.

In a speech to Ukraine's legislature, Biden said , ""The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.""

The most detailed account of Biden's private words comes from Biden himself. At a Council on Foreign Relations event in 2018, he recounted that he had threatened to withhold a ""billion-dollar loan guarantee"" unless Poroshenko followed through on what Biden said was a ""commitment"" to ""take action against the state prosecutor.""

""I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,"" Biden said.

The timeline here is fuzzy: Shokin was not actually terminated while Biden was in the country, as Biden's story made it sound. Ukraine's legislature voted to fire Shokin in March 2016; Biden's last visit to Ukraine before the firing was in December 2015. Biden did have a phone call with Poroshenko the week before the dismissal.

Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN that Shokin's removal was a ""focus"" for Biden ""during numerous trips and phone conversations,"" since the prosecutor was such a major impediment to anti-corruption efforts.

What Trump has been getting wrong

Trump is free to criticize Hunter Biden for taking a position with a Ukrainian company at the same time as his father was directly involved in Ukrainian issues. And Trump is free to criticize Joe Biden for declining to recuse himself from a matter that could conceivably have affected his son's interests.

But Trump has been inaccurate about some of the key facts of the situation.

Claim 1: Trump says Biden called for the firing of a prosecutor ""investigating his son""

Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. For example, Trump alleged Saturday that the media wants to avoid talking about the ""Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son...""

But there is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014 . The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg . Of a 2013 business transaction that was part of the investigation, Lutsenko said, ""(Hunter) Biden was definitely not involved. We do not have any grounds to think that there was any wrongdoing starting from 2014.""

It is not clear how hard Shokin was investigating even Zlochevsky or Burisma at the time Joe Biden pushed for Shokin's firing. Kasko, the prosecutor who resigned from Shokin's office, told Bloomberg that the case was dormant at the time of Joe Biden's intervention: ""There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.""

Shokin told The Hill for an April 2019 article that he had made ""specific plans"" before his firing that ""included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.""

But his assertion that the investigation was active has been challenged.

""Shokin was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma,"" Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Washington Post for a July article. ""And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.""

Claim 2: Trump says Biden told Ukraine to take Shokin off the case

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case,"" Trump said last week.

There is no evidence Biden ever called for Shokin to be ""taken off the case."" In fact, there is no evidence that Biden mentioned the case at all when discussing Shokin with Ukrainian officials. Rather, Biden generally pressured the Ukrainians to fire Shokin, according to reporting from multiple news outlets and Biden's own account of what happened.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for the prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Claim 3: Trump says Joe Biden previously said he spoke to Hunter Biden about Hunter's business dealings

Biden said Saturday, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" Trump responded Sunday, ""He also said, long before, that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again.""

Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Claim 4: The amount of money at issue

Trump has repeatedly alleged that Biden threatened to deny Ukraine ""billions of dollars."" According to Biden, it was a $1 billion loan guarantee. (Less than three months after Shokin was fired, Obama agreed to approve a $1 billion guarantee.)

We don't have independent confirmation of what was discussed, so it's possible that Biden had also raised the subject of additional funds.

One general caveat: it is possible that we'll generally learn more about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine and about the firing of Shokin. But what we know right now shows significant factual problems with Trump's theories."

(CNN) ​When the euphoria from the announcement that the US House will pursue an impeachment inquiry of President Trump wears off for Democrats and others who oppose Trump's administration, and all the talking heads have spoken, remember this -- it's important: Trump didn't change the country; he revealed it.

The latest chapter in the most bizarre political saga in modern memory may very well lead to Trump's removal. Or it may not.

It may encourage Americans to follow the news more closely, it may prompt them to stay further away. It could derail Trump's re-election bid or provide his supporters with an energizing rallying cry. Certainly Trump's team is hoping for the latter, considering that Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Bradley Parscale, tweeted, ""Democrats have officially paved the way for a @realDonaldTrump landslide victory. The witch-hunt continues,"" which feels like a stretch considering Trump comfortably lost the popular vote and his Electoral College victory margin ranked 46th of 58 US elections

Regardless of Parscale's misplaced bravado, the real issue isn't what happens to Trump anyway. It's what happens to the nearly 63 million people who voted for him.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is correct: ""No one is above the law."" But for many who voted for Trump in the first place, this development isn't about the law, the Constitution or the sanctity of democracy. It is about winning. And if being willfully ignorant of Trump's alleged misdeeds helps Republicans win, they'll take it.

Trump also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me,"" Trump says, according to the document.

The release of the transcript showing Trump repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate a political rival comes a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry.

Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky.

At an afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo.""

The rough transcript, which a senior White House official said was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening, will likely amplify the Democratic impeachment effort.

""The fact is that the President of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign at the expense of our national security, as well as undermining the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said after the transcript was released Wednesday. ""That cannot stand. He will be held accountable. No one is above the law.""

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Wednesday that the President's message to the Ukrainian President was clear, despite some debate over whether there was quid pro quo.

""There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office. Even though many read this as a quid pro quo. I'm not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not. Ukraine understood what this President wanted,"" the California Democrat said.

The July 25 call, which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, a source familiar with the situation previously told CNN, a revelation that has only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy.

During the call, Trump suggested four times that Barr will call Zelensky and repeatedly mentions Giuliani, the Trump ally and former New York City mayor.

Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

On the call, Zelensky agreed to the President's request.

""Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate,"" the Ukrainian president said. He later added: ""He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.""

Wednesday, the Ukranian leader said he did not feel pressured.

""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky said in a joint appearance with Trump.

Trump said Wednesday evening that he's willing to release a transcript of another call with the Ukrainian president.

""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the one the public learned more about Wednesday through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released.""

He reiterated that it was a ""very innocent"" call.

'I would like you to do us a favor'

Prior to mentioning Biden, Trump criticized Mueller's testimony from the day prior and raised the possibility of looking into the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which has been retained by Democrats and Republicans in recent years.

After getting hacked in 2016, the Democratic National Committee hired CrowdStrike to investigate the attacks. CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government, which was later confirmed by Mueller's investigation.

Then, Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine is ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US, prompting Trump's reply, ""I would like you to do us a favor.""

""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it,"" Trump told Zelensky according to the transcript.

""There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,"" he added. ""Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.""

There is no evidence Ukraine has the server Trump is referring to.

Trump also told Zelensky the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine.

""A lot of European countries are the same way, so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,"" he said.

Zelensky agreed, and told Trump the US is a ""much bigger partner"" to Ukraine than other European countries regarding sanctions on Russia, adding that he planned to purchase more Javelin missiles from the United States.

Criminal referral

The Justice Department also said Wednesday that it received a criminal referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in late August to investigate whether the President's push for Ukraine to investigate Biden was a violation of campaign finance law.

DOJ declined to bring a case because it found that asking the Ukrainians to investigate Biden was not something of monetary value, and therefore did not run afoul of campaign finance laws.

The Justice Department's examination centered on the July call. Prosecutors interviewed White House officials involved in producing the transcript to establish it was a reliable record of the call. No other interviews were done. The FBI received a separate referral from the inspector general but deferred to the DOJ criminal division which was doing its analysis, according to a senior Justice Department official.

Barr was also not recused from handling the issue despite the fact that his name comes up in Trump's call with Zelensky.

In the ICIG's assessment of the whistleblower complaint, they noted that ""some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate."" The ICIG still determined that the complaint was credible.

Barr hasn't spoken with Trump on Biden

The Justice Department says Barr has not spoken with Trump, the Ukrainian government or Giuliani about the Biden issue.

""The attorney general was first notified of the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral. The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,"" Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement Wednesday.

""The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine -- on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine -- on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani,"" Kupec added.

Congress reacts

The immediate reaction to the transcript from congressional lawmakers was largely split down party lines.

Top Democrats have concluded it showed clear evidence of Trump pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage. Republicans immediately insisted -- as has Trump -- that there was no explicit quid pro quo in the call -- an argument that is likely to form the centerpiece of the anti-impeachment case.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that the transcript is ""pretty damning, in terms of the President trying to put pressure on a foreign government to interfere in our elections or to get dirt on his opponent,"" though he would not say if it contained evidence Trump committed an impeachable offense.

Pelosi however, asserted that the transcript only highlights the need for a formal impeachment inquiry.

""The transcript and the Justice Department's acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President's lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act,"" she said in a statement.

Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the document a ""smoking gun.

""If this is the version of events the president's team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy,"" Warren tweeted.

The Trump 2020 campaign was quick to unleash its own offensive, and several Republicans immediately came to the President's defense.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Democrats would be ""insane"" to impeach Trump over a telephone call.

Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley echoed that sentiment, underlining how the political terrain over the months-long impeachment fight to come is already being drawn.

""I've read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,"" Grassley said.

(CNN) The White House transcript of President Donald Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should cause Republicans to tremble. It reveals that the President did push Zelensky to investigate Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Before asking Zelensky to ""do us a favor"" by helping with this investigation, he reminded him that the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine.

This kind of stunning evidence of the President abusing his power is the reason that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally took the major step of throwing her full support behind the impeachment inquiry. The six committees currently investigating President Trump are now operating under one umbrella with the official mandate of determining whether to vote for articles of impeachment. Should they end up taking this vote, Trump would join a small list that includes only three other presidents who have faced impeachment since the establishment of the country (Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William J. Clinton).

The President has struck back in predictable fashion. ""A total Witch Hunt!"" and ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" were some of the first words to come in over the Twitter transom . A number of Republicans have already joined him. At the heart of the counterattack is the claim that impeachment is a radical action. The entire process, Republicans will likely continue to say, is being driven by a Democratic party motivated by its left-wing base. Trump will try to defeat Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats as President Clinton prevailed over Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in 1998

If Democrats want to retain the support of their moderate wing who have joined this cause and desire to stand any chance of winning over Republican support in the House or Senate, they will need to respond to these charges of harassment. Fortunately for Speaker Pelosi, in the case of Trump, supporters of impeachment have a series of cogent arguments to make to convince GOP members of Congress.

While much of the discussion has centered around the Democrats, the spotlight should be on the GOP. They are the party being tested. And there are four reasons why there is a clear conservative case for the impeachment of President Trump.

1. Restraining the power of presidents

Restraining presidential power should be a top priority for conservatives. Few recent presidents have exercised their power with the same level of reckless abandon as the current commander in chief. If Republicans mean what they say about championing limited government, then there really is no justification for the party's decisions since the time of Richard Nixon to continue granting power to the executive branch when their party was in power. Simply put, further empowering the President means growing the role of government. The fact that the President has so much authority, from the ability to send troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war to using executive measures to achieve policy goals like building a wall, does not square with their agenda.

Unlikely as it may seem, supporting impeachment is an unprecedented opportunity to reverse course on their hypocrisy and re-embody their own ideals. Trump has exposed, more than almost any of his recent predecessors, just how much a president can do if they are willing to ignore basic norms and if they are not scared about the potential response from Congress or the courts. Supporting the impeachment process, and possibly a decision to impeach and convict, could allow Republicans to go on record showing that they still do believe in small government.

2. Protecting national security

Protecting national security has also been a central goal of the conservative movement. During the 1980s, for instance, President Ronald Reagan railed against Democrats for being weak on defense as he pushed for higher defense spending and insisted on taking a tough stand with the Soviets. George W. Bush pushed for a proactive militaristic response to terrorist networks as well as states that he claimed threatened American interests. Yet President Trump has not done much to uphold this tradition. His coziness with Vladmir Putin has frustrated intelligence and military officials who understand that Russia has been conducting ongoing efforts to interfere in our electoral system.

The President has handled relations with North Korea in topsy-turvy fashion, doing little to produce an actual nuclear weapons agreement or halt North Korea's weapons production. His efforts to persuade Ukraine , possibly withholding military aid as an incentive to investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden, have inspired similar fears. All of this prompted seven moderate Democrats who are veterans of the military to publish their Washington Post piece endorsing the impeachment inquiry.

3. Standing up for the rule of law

Republicans have also loved to imagine that they are the party of law and order. Ever since Richard Nixon's time in office, they have tried to assure voters that they are the party that can be best trusted to follow the rule of law and to give law enforcement institutions all the support they need. Under the Trump administration, they have so far been sitting passively as a President ran roughshod over all the institutions they have claimed to champion. Throughout his presidency, Trump has peddled mendacity and offered disinformation contradicting solid intelligence data that has been collected on matters like Russia. He has repeatedly acted with disregard for the law, he's been accused of flagrantly obstructing justice while under investigation by Mueller and refused to cooperate fully with congressional oversight.

The current scandal was triggered by the fact that the administration did not share the whistleblower complaint with Congress, as is required by law. The accumulation of evidence that the President does not abide by the rule of law is overwhelming. Republicans can only show Americans they still care about this crucial aspect of our democracy if they cooperate with this investigation.

4. Mike Pence

In addition to these three core conservative elements behind the impeachment investigation, Democrats looking to forge bipartisan accord can reiterate that if President Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be replaced by an extraordinarily conservative Republican -- Vice President Mike Pence -- who is arguably even more rightward than the President. So if this really is a left-wing effort to mount a coup, it is poorly conceived. Success would not change the balance of partisan power nor would it in any way moderate the agenda of the White House.

Based on the voluminous evidence that we already have of Trump's wrongdoing, there is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles. In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for."

(CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just announced that Congress is launching a formal impeachment inquiry. The allegations that President Donald Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in an effort to persuade Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic candidate Joe Biden has turned out to be a genuine tipping point. Seven moderate Democrats with previous military service published an op-ed in the Washington Post. ""We believe these actions represent an impeachable offense,"" they said.

After several months, when Pelosi resisted taking this step for fear of a political backlash, President Trump finally found a way to go too far. It turns out that there might still be a line in American politics, and he just crossed it.

As Democrats officially start the impeachment process and undertake the investigation, they will continue to be haunted by historical comparisons.

Democrats who are leery about moving forward see the late-1990s impeachment of Bill Clinton all over again. With the 2020 election in the balance, they fear that their party will end up like the Republicans, moving forward to impeach the President only to encounter a fierce political backlash against their party for seeming too extreme.

Other Democrats, who have been calling for impeachment since the release of Robert Mueller's report, see a repeat of the early-1970s. In their minds, Trump is the new Richard Nixon, just on steroids. For them, moving forward with impeachment is not only the right thing to do but it will also strengthen the Democrats politically, by putting them on the right side of history.

The truth is we don't know how this will turn out. The trouble with speculation is that the future remains unpredictable. We can make educated guesses about how the politics might unfold and we can look to previous examples to better understand what is happening. But at the end of the day, the impeachment of Trump must be understood on its own terms.

This process will play out within the particular dynamics of 2019 and 2020. It is easy to map out how either prediction could be true. At the same time, it is even easier to imagine how we can't really envision or anticipate what is going to happen and what the ultimate political effects will be.

The impeachment process is always especially uncertain since it revolves around an intense investigation that sheds light on a situation rather than confirming what we already know. This means that, if the process is handled well, we will have many more facts on the table before any vote for articles of impeachment takes place.

While we live in an era where facts often don't matter and the people make decisions based on partisan preferences, dramatic revelations can still shake the status quo. That's what happened with Nixon -- the process itself dramatically changed public opinion. We have just seen that within the past few hours, as the heads of even the most seasoned Washington watchers are spinning.

Democrats need to make their decisions based on the obligations of the office and a respect for our democratic institutions. If there is one big lesson from the last two of our three impeachment processes -- it is that voters rewarded the party that in 1974 took this bold step but did so in a serious way, focusing on the health of our democratic institutions and the balance of power. When the Republican party seemed to move forward in a haphazard and clearly partisan manner in 1997 and 1998, the public disapproved of their actions.

Although politics is naturally always on the mind of any elected official, this is a moment when they need to make those considerations secondary. It looks like Democrats have finally reached a point in their thinking, where they are willing to do what is right rather than what might be the easiest political path."

Facts First: Joe Biden did not brag that he stopped any prosecution. Rather, he bragged that he had successfully pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who was widely criticized for failing to bring corruption prosecutions.

Trump's suggestion was that Biden had boasted of stopping the ""prosecution"" of the business dealings of Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a company, Burisma Holdings, for which his son Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

But there was no actual prosecution of Zlochevsky or Burisma -- just an investigation that had not produced any prosecutions and that does not seem to have been pursued vigorously.

There is no evidence Joe Biden ever tried to thwart this investigation, much less that he boasted about doing so.

What Biden said

Joe Biden, the administration's point man on the Ukraine file, pressured Ukrainian leaders to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had faced international criticism for what was seen as an unwillingness to prosecute elite corruption.

Shokin, hired in 2015, was fired in 2016. Biden bragged about the saga at an event in January 2018 , recounting how he had threatened to withhold a billion-dollar US loan guarantee to Ukraine if Shokin was not removed.

At no point during Biden's story did he mention the investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma. Further, there is no sign that Biden did anything to impede the investigation -- which may not even have been active at the time.

Vitaliy Kasko, a former deputy prosecutor who resigned from Shokin's office in February 2016, alleging that the office was itself corrupt, told Bloomberg this year that the investigation was dormant by the time of Joe Biden's intervention. Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Washington Post for a July article that ""Shokin was not investigating.""

In a 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, blasted ""corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General's Office"" for working against anti-corruption efforts. One example Pyatt cited: the office's refusal to assist in a United Kingdom investigation into Zlochevsky

The claim about CrowdStrike

According to the document released by the White House, Trump also said to Zelensky: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people...The server, they say Ukraine has it."" (The ellipses are in the White House document.)

It's not entirely clear what Trump meant, but some inferences can be made based on his previous remarks.

CrowdStrike isn't Ukrainian, but Trump has said it is.

One of the company's senior executives previously had a lengthy career at the FBI . And one of its co-founders, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a prominent think tank in Washington. Alperovitch was born in the Soviet Union, in what is now Russia, then emigrated with his family to the US.

It isn't clear who Trump was referring to when he mentioned ""one of your wealthy people,"" but in a 2017 interview with the Associated Press , he said he has heard CrowdStrike ""is Ukrainian-based."" It was not then and it is not now.

""I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard,"" Trump added in that 2017 interview, though, again, it is not and was not.

It is possible Trump was alluding to a very vague conspiracy theory involving wealthy Ukrainian businessman Viktor Pinchuk , a financial supporter of the Atlantic Council, where, again, Alperovitch is a senior fellow.

There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Pinchuk.

CrowdStrike and the DNC

Trump did not specify to Zelensky what he meant by ""the server,"" but he has repeatedly complained about how the Democratic National Committee and the FBI handled a hack into DNC servers in 2016.The DNC hired CrowdStrike in 2016 to investigate the hack.

After conducting an investigation, CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government for the hack -- a finding later confirmed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Trump and his Republican allies have fomented conspiracy theories about the hack since 2016. Trump has publicly rejected overwhelming evidence that Russia was the country responsible. And he has repeatedly questioned why the DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the breach instead of handing its servers over to the FBI for direct examination.

There is no evidence to support the conspiracies about the DNC servers. But by withholding the servers from the FBI, Democrats created a talking point for Republicans, who have claimed that the DNC was hiding something.

Former FBI director James Comey, who led the early phases of the Russia investigation, testified in 2017 that it would have been better if the DNC gave the servers to the FBI, but that the FBI was able to get the forensic information it needed from CrowdStrike. Mueller later brought detailed criminal charges against Russian hackers for their involvement in the hacks.

CrowdStrike said in a statement on Wednesday: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community."""

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden lead the Democratic field in New Hampshire, with 27% and 25% support respectively, according to a new poll of likely Democratic primary voters from Monmouth University on Tuesday.

In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 10%.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

""We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act. I have been patient while we tried every other path and used every other tool. We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution. The future of our democracy is at stake,"" Lewis said in a speech on the House floor.

He continued: ""I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay, or to do otherwise, would betray the foundation of our democracy.""

The comments from Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and longtime respected member of the Democratic caucus, come as members of his party are increasingly calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Lewis' remarks could help increase support for impeachment, particularly among members of the Congressional Black Caucus, of which the congressman is a member.

Congressional Democrats have been urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has so far been reluctant to support impeachment proceedings, to change her mind on the issue in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to block the release to Congress of a whistleblower complaint. The July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressured the leader , according to a person familiar with the situation, was part of the complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

Mitt Romney had been a lone Republican voice expressing concern about President Donald Trump's July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked Ukraine's President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.

Romney came to Washington promising to speak out against the President when the time called for it. Days ago, he became the first prominent elected Republican to convey his dismay about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, one of Trump's political rivals for the White House, and Biden's son at a time when Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.

There were some signs on Wednesday evening that other Republican voices, including one GOP senator who had read the whisteblower complaint in a secure setting, that Romney may no longer be alone in his concerns.

Romney stood his ground on Wednesday after reading the call summary of the discussion between Trump and Zelensky.

""My reaction was the same as (the one) I had a few days ago, which is -- this remains deeply troubling,"" Romney said during an interview at The Atlantic Festival on Wednesday. ""We'll see where it leads, but the first reaction is troubling.""

Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican up for election in 2020, echoed those thoughts after reading the complaint on Wednesday evening.

""This (is) going to take a long time but there's obviously some very troubling things here. But I think the partisan tribalism that's always insta-certain is a terrible idea. There are real troubling things here. Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach' before they knew anything about the actual substance.""

Other senators had criticisms for the President as well. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, called Trump's conversation with Zelensky ""inappropriate"" in a statement earlier in the day.

GOP Ohio Sen. Rob Portman also told CNN's Manu Raju that nothing in the transcript surprised him. ""It was exactly what I expected.""

But when pressed about whether Trump should have asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden, Portman added: ""It didn't surprise me, because he said he did. I would rather have seen that—yes—he should not have.""

It was on Sunday that Romney tweeted that ""if the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out."" That made him the first Republican to forcefully express concern with Trump's actions.

The Trump White House clearly believed Wednesday that releasing details of the July 25 conversation -- as well as sending the related whistleblower complaint to Congress -- would clear up the matter for their opponents and doubters, and perhaps ease some of the pressure for impeachment proceedings in the US House.

But as lawmakers parsed the sentences of the call summary on Wednesday, the opposite seemed true. Still, most Republicans swiftly fell in line with the administration's argument that the call summary showed there was no direct quid pro quo.

Romney, on the other hand, continued to say he wanted to see all the information, including the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint that the White House is sending over to Congress.

Romney sidestepped a question at The Atlantic Festival about whether he saw the implication of a quid pro quo in the call summary.

The Utah senator explained he ""wasn't as focused"" on the potential quid pro quo aspect of the call as others, but added: ""If the President of the United States asks or presses the leader of a foreign country to carry out an investigation of a political nature that's troubling, and I feel that.""

To underscore his point, the Utah senator pointed to the extraordinary power of the presidency, as well as the House and the Senate.

""I think it's very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that's most amenable to maintaining their power and doing things to preserve their power,"" Romney said when asked by the moderator why he was virtually alone among GOP officials in highlighting the seriousness of the potential offense by the President.

Perhaps as a way of explaining Trump's motivation for talking to Zelensky about Biden and his son -- and his party's inclination to defend the President, Romney noted that both parties feel deeply that if the opposing party were in charge ""terrible things would happen for the country ... and it's critical for them to hold on to their leadership.""

""I think it's just in human nature to see things in a way that is consistent with your own world view and your sense of what's necessary for the preservation of your position of power,"" Romney said. ""I don't know why I'm not afflicted to the same degree as perhaps others are in that regard. Maybe it's because I'm old and have done other things.""

The Utahn declined to wade into the impeachment debate, stating that the House was considering the President's actions and that he wasn't going to ""give advice to Speaker Pelosi.""

When Romney was elected to the Senate from the deep red state of Utah, he promised that he would stand up to Trump if he believed he was wrong. That was appreciated by his constituents who -- though overwhelmingly Republican -- generally give lower marks to Trump than voters in other red states.

""He's got a pretty strong moral compass,"" said Lanhee Chen, who advised Romney on foreign policy during his 2012 run for the White House.

""He was going to speak his mind without regard to party or politics, and this is very much in line with that,"" said Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and lecturer in the public policy program at Stanford University. ""He has great concern about what he sees as potential misuse or malfeasance in office."""

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade.

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures.

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

That man? Attorney General William Barr.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,"" Trump told Zelensky on the call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.)

On two more occasions during that conversation, Trump said he would have Barr (in addition to Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) get in touch with Zelensky to look into the Biden thing.

Which is problematic, given that Trump is seemingly putting America's attorney general in charge of coordinating an investigation -- with a foreign power! -- into a possible 2020 rival. Knowing what that looks like, the Justice Department released a statement in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's transcript release, denying that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians.

""The Attorney General was first notified of the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral,"" said Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec.

The mishap adds another surreal layer to Wednesday's swirl of events. A White House transcript of a July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky reveals Trump's efforts to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, further ratcheting up talk among Democrats to conduct an impeachment investigation.

""The transcript clearly shows there was no quid pro quo or anything else inappropriate about the conversation between President Trump and President (Volodymr) Zelenskyy,"" one of the talking points says.

Trump, who was in the middle of a broad review of foreign aid programs when he singled out Ukraine specifically this summer, was primarily concerned with ""corruption"" in Ukraine and Europe shouldering more of the financial burden for supporting Ukraine's defense, according to one of the officials.

News of Trump's order to withhold aid to the Ukraine ahead of his July 25 call may trigger questions -- and speculation -- about the President's motive in doing so.

Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of military and security aid to Ukraine at least a week before the call in question, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The Washington Post first reported the figure.

The administration was looking at harnessing multiple foreign packages, several aides believed, when Trump took a special interest in Ukraine, at times railing about how the country wasted money in his eyes. This surprised several staffers because, as CNN has reported, Trump had not been interested in engaging with Ukraine in the past, believing Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Wednesday addressed reporters after viewing a federal employee’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s telephone conversation with the leader of Ukraine, claiming it “exposed serious wrongdoing.”

House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff speaks after reviewing the whistleblower complaint https://t.co/aYIcGo5zvO pic.twitter.com/Eh0qU5Et4b — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 25, 2019

In his remarks, Schiff described the complaint as “well-written” and praised the still-anonymous individual who authored the complaint as brave.

“What this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing, and I think it a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it was, because it was an urgent matter, it is an urgent matter,” he said.

The complaint, received by acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire a number of weeks ago, alleges that President Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden, back in July.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Although Schiff stands behind the so-called “whistleblower’s” crediblity, the Department of Justice on Wednesday confirmed that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found the individual who made the complaint has a “political bias” that was “in favor of a rival political candidate.”

According to a memo released by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, the inspector general stated that it received a complaint of “urgent concern,” though the OLC determined the matter “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” or require that the national intelligence director send the complaint to House and Senate intelligence committees.

During a joint press conference at the United Nations, both President Trump and Zelensky confirmed the conversation occurred and affirmed no pressure was applied to probe the Biden family. “I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.

Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the call, which shows the pair discussed U.S. military aid to Ukraine and Hunter Biden — and there was no quid pro quo discussed at any point of the conversation.

Nonetheless, the call prompted a group of House Democrats to come out in favor of impeachment and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to endorse a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.

Asked for his thoughts on the move by Pelosi, President Trump suggested the California Democrat has lost control of her caucus.

“[Speaker Pelosi’s] been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party. You take a look at what’s happening in the media today. The whole party is taken over by the left and thank you very much — my poll numbers have gone up,” he said.

Of the impeachment probe, House Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News that Democrats “lost their minds” and predicted it will “backfire on them” in the 2020 election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” said McCarthy. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”"

Let's go through it, step by step.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

1. Trump, after congratulating Zelensky on his win, very quickly establishes that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

2. He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US.

""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr.

""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""

5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion

""I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.""

So, in sum: The President of the United States tells a foreign leader that we do a lot for his country and his country hasn't done enough for us. Then he says that it would be super nice if Ukraine looked into allegations -- debunked by all independent fact checkers and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, it's worth noting -- that his main rival in the 2020 race did some unethical things in the country. Because, he asserts, it sounds ""horrible"" to him. And then reiterates -- several times! -- that the Ukrainian president needs to talk to his personal lawyer and his administration's attorney general about all of this.

Are you kidding me? And reminder, this isn't even really a transcript of their call. As the document notes: ""The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.""

Even if Trump hadn't openly asked Zelensky to look into Biden and instead only suggested that he had heard rumors of corruption regarding the Bidens and Ukraine, this call would be problematic. Because the United States is a global superpower which was, at that moment, withholding loan money from Ukraine -- a fact that the newly elected president of said country would be intimately aware of. That Trump just came out and asked for Zelensky to investigate the Bidens -- after reminding him several times of how much the US did for Ukraine!!!! -- is something very close to the textbook definition of a quid pro quo.

Take it out of the context of politics. Let's say you are a small business owner who has seen an uptick in business thanks to a series of referrals coming to you via a much larger company. And the CEO of that much larger company calls you and says something like ""We are doing a lot of good for your bottom line, right? More than you are doing for us. So, hey, our biggest competitor is apparently doing some pretty nasty things with their workers. You should really look into that.""

Now the larger company CEO didn't come out and say, ""Hey, do this muckraking of our main competitor or else your pipeline gets cut off by us,"" right? But unless your brain stem has somehow disconnected from your brain, you know exactly what is being asked here. Do this, or else.

It's hard to imagine why Trump, knowing what he said, would have spent the past 48 hours defending the call as ""perfect"" and totally above board. The actual transcript makes that pre-spin laughable.

""It ended up being a nothing call,"" Trump said in the wake of the release of the transcript on Wednesday morning.

But what is documented, very clearly, in this kind-of, sort-of transcript is this: The American President pressuring a foreign leader to look into the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. And doing it by reminding the Ukrainian President of all the US has done for his country.

The transcript is truly stunning stuff -- even from a President who has moved the goalposts on ""stunning"" a long time ago. If Trump thought releasing this transcript would somehow make Democrats look like fools for beginning an impeachment inquiry against him, he was wrong. Very, very wrong."

(CNN) The White House released a rough transcript Wednesday of a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, indicating that the President pressured a foreign leader to gather dirt on a political opponent.

Frank Bowman III

As a result, we now have facts quite distinct from any that have come out about this President before -- and the strongest, or at least most easily explainable, case for impeachment to date.

The allegations at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election concerned Trump's conduct while he was a candidate for office. There is good authority from the founding era that an effort to corrupt the electoral process ahead of an election might be impeachable. For example, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, both George Mason and Gouverneur Morris observed that a president who ""procured his appointment"" by corrupting the electors must be impeachable.

But since impeachment is at its core about a president's misuse of office or suitability to hold it, pre-inauguration conduct at least raises a tricky question. Whatever happened with the Russians during the 2016 election, Trump wasn't then in a position to use the organs of the American state to encourage foreign interference.

(CNN) The Trump-Ukraine story might seem complicated and there is much that we still have to learn, but the implications are clear: President Donald Trump apparently betrayed his country, and now, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced, his actions have triggered a formal impeachment inquiry.

His administration refused to share with Congress an urgent whistleblower complaint by an intelligence agent (although sources familiar with the matter say it may be released Wednesday), so we don't yet know the full details.

Still, media investigations have revealed the main outlines of the story: In July, Trump withheld military aid while pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to look into discredited allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's leading challenger in the 2020 election. Trump has acknowledged that he spoke with Zelensky about corruption and about Biden.

Trump would have us believe that this is all perfectly normal, and that his withholding of the military aid had nothing to do with his desire for an investigation of Biden. (On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he would release the ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky"" Wednesday.)

But none of this is normal. In fact, if Trump was trying to make a deal with the President of Ukraine, it was a crass move that put his personal political interests above those of the country he swore to serve.

Trump's actions toward Ukraine are likely a violation of anti-corruption laws , on top of his apparent violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. More importantly, Trump's behavior constitutes a violation of his oath of office, of his vow to ""protect and defend"" his nation, of the trust of the American people and of the most fundamental duties he accepted when he became President of the United States.

The apparent extortion of Ukraine is far worse than his solicitation and acceptance of Russian help to win in 2016. We'll see what the transcript of the call reveals, but it's worth noting that CNN reports the call is only part of the whistleblower complaint. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says that the whistleblower wants to testify before the committee.

When candidate Trump asked the Kremlin to help him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- saying , ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"" -- it was a despicable move to solicit assistance from a hostile power to influence an American election. But at the time Trump was a private citizen, without access to the vast power and resources of the executive branch.

This time, the President has engaged in what looks very much like extortion: demanding help smearing Biden in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid, and pressuring a desperate country to interfere in the 2020 US elections to help Trump tarnish the Democratic frontrunner.

On Tuesday, Trump again insisted he'd done nothing wrong and offered a new explanation for why he had withheld military aid, claiming that he'd done so because ""Europe and other nations"" were not contributing to helping Ukraine. That claim is false , and wouldn't justify the administration in pressuring Ukraine to investigate an opponent, or refusing to comply with a whistleblower law.

To all appearances, Trump has put pressure on Ukraine by hijacking $250 million dollars of US taxpayers' money that Congress had voted to give Ukraine so it could strengthen its defenses against its aggressive neighbor, Russia -- the country that helped Trump win the presidency in 2016.

The White House and Congress clashed bitterly over Trump's refusal to release these approved funds. After all, Congress made a decision based on what it believed was in the best interest of US national security . Trump did release the money -- after the whistleblower complaint was filed and was declared an "" urgent concern "" by the nonpartisan inspector general.

When Trump told President Zelensky last July to investigate Joe Biden and his son -- Trump made the demand about eight times in one conversation, according to the Wall Street Journal -- he was, at minimum, implicitly threatening that Ukraine's relationship with the United States, including military aid, was at stake. Whether or not he phrased it in such crass terms is only marginally important.

In pressuring Ukraine like this, Trump is leaving the country with a crushingly difficult choice. At the moment, the country is doing battle with Russian-backed, Russian-armed rebels , just five years after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea, and Russia continues actively assaulting Ukrainian sovereignty.

On the call with Zelensky, Trump insisted that Ukraine deal with his attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. According to Ukraine's summary of the call , Trump expressed optimism that the new Ukrainian government would forcefully pursue ""corruption cases"" which inhibited the interaction between the two countries. In the White House description of the call, which does not appear on the White House website, Trump congratulated President Zelensky on the latter's election and ""discussed ways to strengthen cooperation.""

There was no mention of investigations in the White House description of the July call.

A crucial, disturbing aspect of this scandal is that it breathes life into Trump's unsubstantiated accusations against Biden. Trump loyalists are telling Fox News viewers that there's a real scandal here, even though Ukrainian prosecutors insist the former Vice President did nothing wrong.

In addition to breaking faith with US voters and undermining the US national interest, the apparent extortion attempt may well qualify as criminal conduct under the Hobbs Act , a statute that bans public officials from demanding something of value in exchange for carrying out the duties of their office.

Trump, to all accounts, demanded something of value from the Ukrainian President: namely, help tarnishing his political rival. And he did not carry out the duty of disbursing legally mandated aid until September 11, weeks after the whistleblower had filed his complaint.

Along with Pelosi, another central figure who has been reluctant to call for impeachment appears to be changing his mind.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that he is not yet sure whether the Ukraine call was the subject of the whistleblower complaint, but that if a sitting president's telephone call with a foreign leader ""involve(d) potential corruption or criminality,"" or was used for ""political advantage against our nation's interest,"" then that would be the gravest violation yet of this presidency -- or perhaps of ""any presidency.""

If that is indeed what happened, and the signs strongly suggest it is, then Trump's behavior makes Watergate look like petty pickpocketing.

Trump likely betrayed his country, and he did it on the world stage, using taxpayers' money and toying with American security. What could be worse?"

""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump tweeted while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Trump's pledge comes amid growing calls for impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry later Tuesday.

Trump admitted Tuesday that he delayed aid to Ukraine ahead of a call to Zelensky, when he pushed the leader to look into potential rival Joe Biden and his son's work in Ukraine, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid and claiming there was ""never any quid pro quo.""

Trump is struggling to respond to revelations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. And judging from his babbling public performance before reporters at the UN General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, he does not know how to cope.

As usual, the President talked about a ""witch hunt"" and ""fake news"" and popularity polls as he spoke in the hoarse voice that seems to come over him in moments of stress. Then he damaged the case for his own defense, saying that if then-Vice President Joe Biden had sought a favor from Ukraine in 2015, it would have constituted an ""impeachable event.""

There's no proof that Biden sought favors from Ukraine. In fact the idea that he did is refuted in original reports on the matter. But a rough White House transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows that the President did exactly what he'd suggested Biden had done.

""I would like you to do us a favor,"" Trump said to Zelensky, according to the White House transcript of the call. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son. That Biden stopped the prosecutions and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""

If there's ""a lot of talk"" about Biden's son, it has been generated mainly by the President, his supporters and his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump told Zelensky that both Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani would be calling the Ukrainian President.

As Biden has long occupied the front-runner position in the Democratic primary, Trump has cause to fear him -- and to try to undermine him. But urging Ukraine to investigate Biden's son constitutes an abuse of the public trust.

Why would Trump use a phone call with a foreign leader to ask for a blatantly personal and political favor? I would suggest that Trump expects the government to function like his personal business -- and as a result he can't imagine that anything he might desire would be out of bounds for a president.

Throughout his life, Trump has operated under special conditions that allowed him to get away with almost anything. The classic example came when his extremely wealthy father bailed out his casino by purchasing $3.5 million worth of chips at a blackjack table and then left the casino without gambling. This gambit broke state regulations, but the resulting fine -- $30,000 -- was paltry, and the deposit provided much-needed cashflow.

Family wealth bailed Trump out of other difficulties and made it possible for him to take risks that others would have avoided. Bankruptcy followed bankruptcy , but because Trump's family money was protected by corporate structures, he maintained his high-profile lifestyle and kept on promoting himself as a super-successful businessman. He spread lies about the prominent women who had allegedly pursued him as a romantic partner, and he offered wildly varying claims about his personal wealth. Trump has even said that his net worth depends on how he feels at a given moment.

The truth about Trump remained elusive because so much of what he claimed could not be verified. His privately held businesses were not required to produce accurate public financial reports, and they never did. Meanwhile, how do you determine whether, as Trump claimed , he had once been one of the best young baseball players in New York?

As his biographer, I put time into checking Trump's claims and discovered that many, like the one about his baseball prowess, were false. These lies didn't threaten the whole country when he was just the clown prince of New York real estate and a reality TV show host boasting, falsely, about his ratings.

But now that Trump is President, all the bluster that may have seemed amusing and harmless to those who stayed outside Trump's orbit has plunged the nation into a constitutional crisis.

What we've seen in just this one Trump scandal -- and there are many more -- suggests that the President is incapable of fulfilling his duties and may even be driven by self-destructive impulses.

As Trump acknowledged last week, a president's calls with foreign leaders are overheard by other US officials, who take notes. Given this knowledge, Trump's attempt to enlist Zelensky in his harebrained scheme was not just an abuse of public trust; it also demonstrates Trump's true beliefs about human nature. Who could be surprised that a national security official filed a whistleblower complaint about that phone call with Zelensky? Only a person who assumes that no one else ever acts out of a sense of ethical and moral duty.

What Trump seems to have ignored is that the American President operates in a system designed to check abuses -- and that the government he heads might be filled with people of conscience. As this scandal unfolds, the administration will come to learn the meaning of accountability. For Trump personally, it will be the first time."

Sitting in the same building where he launched his long shot presidential campaign four years ago, Trump said he couldn't believe it, he later told people.

He had felt confident after phoning Pelosi earlier that morning. The drive for impeachment in her caucus had ramped up amid reports he pushed the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden , and Trump was hoping to head off a clash. He figured he could de-escalate tensions by speaking with her directly.

It was after that call that Trump made the decision to release an ""unredacted"" version of the transcript of his July call -- against the advice of aides such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned him it would set a risky precedent. Trump wanted to undercut the argument from Democrats that he acted inappropriately, he said, and felt he had nothing to hide.

But when the announcement he would release the transcript did little to quell the growing calls for his impeachment, Trump was in disbelief.

Democrats immediately argued that it wouldn't be enough. They also wanted to see the whistleblower's complaint , which had been found urgent and credible by the inspector general for the intelligence community and was mandated by law to be handed over to the intelligence committees. Administration officials began working out a plan to declassify and redact the complaint so it could be turned over too, all in the hope of easing escalated tensions with lawmakers.

The White House is making its own moves, making public a key telephone transcript and preparing to release to Congress a whistleblower's report as early as Wednesday, according to two sources familiar. Politico first reported the White House's intention . One source told CNN the whistleblower report is under review and going through declassification and could be released within hours of the transcript release.

The investigation will test accusations that Trump sought to pressure a foreign power -- Ukraine -- into effectively intervening in the 2020 election to damage one of his possible Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden.

""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in a news conference. ""Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.""

Trump lamented the news in that it took the focus off his trip the United Nations General Assembly.

""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!"" the President.

Her decision elevates the turmoil and division whipped up by Trump's two-and-half years in power to historic proportions with massive political stakes for the 2020 election and beyond.

Pelosi, after months of trying to slow walk impeachment demands from her liberal base, elected to strike, despite the President agreeing to release a transcript on Wednesday of a call with Ukraine's President. Trump says the document will clear him of wrongdoing despite his public admission that he pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into Biden and his son -- a fact in itself that his opponents argue is a gross abuse of power.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Only two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Now there is the possibility it could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump's presidency.

An impeachment inquiry would be the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself.

Unfolding events

Tuesday's developments unfolded at staggering speed in Washington and in New York where the President's ""America First"" speech to the United General Assembly was overshadowed.

Trump decided to release the transcript under fierce political pressure over claims, first triggered by a whistleblower's complaint, that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military and security aid to force Kiev to open an investigation into his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son, Hunter.

There is no evidence to support claims -- made in public by Trump as recently as Tuesday morning -- that the Bidens had corrupt dealings with the former Soviet Republic.

At the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25.

He said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share.

Later, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript -- opposed by senior aides -- would show that there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump tweeted.

Some senior Democrats however insist that there need not be a quid pro quo for Trump to have committed a ""high crime and misdemeanor"" needed for a President to be impeached.

The simple fact of a President asking a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political opponent is seen by many legal and political commentators as an abuse of power.

Pelosi's strategy

In an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: ""The President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country.""

The House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it's possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question.

But she shifted her position as a political torrent changed the shape of the impeachment debate in Washington. A number of moderate swing-state Democrats who she had been trying to protect, moved to the impeachment side of the argument.

She said that the nature of Trump's alleged offense was clear -- a factor that might have changed the political equation.

""This is the most understandable by the public. And It's really important to know this. There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,"" she said. ""You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That's what we try to stop with Russia. It's wrong.""

Pelosi told her caucus that the impeachment would center around six House committees already investigating the President. It would be up to the Judiciary Committee eventually to decide whether to advance Articles of Impeachment. If the full House votes by simple majority to impeach a President his trial then takes place in the Senate.

There is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP controlled chamber is waning. That means the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict the president on Articles of Impeachment and to oust him from office looks at this point unlikely to materialize.

Like Pelosi, Biden also seems to be calculating his political position. As the subject of Trump's attacks and the Democratic front runner, he is in a unique position in the cascading drama.

In an on camera appearance apparently meant to project presidential gravitas and temperament, the former vice president said that if Trump failed to provide information about the case, he would leave lawmakers with no choice.

""Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American president. It's an abuse of power,"" Biden said.

""Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" Biden said.

Obstacles

Democratic reluctance to move ahead with impeachment, despite what many in the party see as gross abuses of power revealed by special counsel Robert Mueller, has partly been based on fears of igniting Trump's base and causing a 2020 political backlash.

Impeachment -- that can result in a democratic election being overturned -- is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years.

In another potentially enormous development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump's conduct, wants to speak to the committee.

The whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. Maguire had been under pressure from the White House and Justice Department not to turn over the whistleblower's complaint, but that appeared to change late Tuesday, so it was not clear how realistic are Democratic hopes of hearing the testimony.

Trump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar told CNN. It's unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint.

Two White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be ""underwhelming.""

One of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important. But the official raised questions about the credibility of the the administration employee who filed the complaint about Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian President, referring to the employee as ""the so-called whistleblower."""

Bob Menendez -- sent to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Inspector General Steve Linick -- come after the New Jersey Democrat made clear on the House floor Monday that he would seek more information on the call as House Democrats near a ""tipping point"" on impeachment in the wake of the Trump administration blocking a related whistleblower complaint's release to Congress.

On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part o f the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

In his letter to Linick, Menendez requests that the Inspector General ""immediately open an investigation"" into the Trump administration's withholding of foreign military assistance to Ukraine and whether it was tied to the whistleblower complaint.

""Look, my position remains the same. I think impeachment would be terribly divisive for our already very divided country,"" Gabbard said in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""I think Congress needs to exercise oversight over the information that's been leaked. I think it's important this transcript is released to Congress so that Congress can do its job.""

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has cautioned against impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so.

Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Sitting in a Manhattan hotel meeting room, the men eagerly sought to deflect questions of wrongdoing after a White House transcript released earlier in the day showed Trump pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The call has formed the basis for Democrats' impeachment probe, and has thrown Trump's presidency into turmoil. But as camera shutters whirred, Trump and Zelensky insisted nothing was untoward.

""There was no pressure,"" Trump insisted, denying allegations he was using his position of power to prod Ukraine into investigating a political rival.

""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky chimed in, denying he felt coerced by Trump to launch a probe. Instead, he suggested he was an unwilling participant in an American political firestorm.

""I'm sorry but I don't want to be involved (in) democratic open elections of USA,"" he said after consulting with a translator.

It may be too late for that. The controversy over Trump's dealings with Zelensky have massed into a political and diplomatic watershed, with Ukraine squarely in the center.

Trump remained defiant during a rambling Wednesday afternoon news conference that he ""didn't threaten anybody.""

""No push, no pressure, no nothing,"" Trump said. ""It's all a hoax, folks.""

Trump added, ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with the senators.""

He said he's told House Republicans he wants ""full transparency on the so-called whistleblower information,"" but continued to peddle conspiracy theories about Biden and his son. He also challenged the credibility of the whistleblower's claims.

Trump claimed the individual -- who has not been identified -- ""didn't have any first-class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand.""

The President told reporters he's willing to release a transcript of another, earlier call with Zelensky, as well as any calls between Ukraine and Vice President Mike Pence.

""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the July 25 conversation the public learned more about today through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released.""

The mid-afternoon meeting between Trump and Zelensky was arranged well before the whistleblower controversy exploded into public view, according to people familiar with the plans. Aides initially did not view it as a major highlight of Trump's agenda at this week's United Nations meetings, which they expected would focus heavily on Iran and not on the questions of abuse of power.

When news emerged that an intelligence whistleblower had filed a complaint related to Trump and Ukraine -- and later that it was related to Trump's July phone call with Zelensky -- White House officials began to view the meeting as an important venue for Trump to counter Democratic accusations of wrongdoing.

Trump began by making light of the matter, telling reporters that Zelensky ""made me more famous and I've made him more famous.""

And later his attention seemed to drift, recalling his onetime ownership of the Miss Universe pageant, won once by a Ukrainian contestant.

But the mood turned grave as Zelensky -- himself a former television personality whose entry into politics was as unlikely as Trump's -- raised Russia's annexation of Crimea.

""If you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration. Not during the Trump administration,"" Trump insisted, ascribing the invasion to his predecessor Barack Obama.

Asked whether he wants Zelensky to do more to investigate Biden, Trump said, ""No, I want him to do whatever he can.""

The evening before the meeting, Trump and Zelensky greeted each other at a diplomatic reception hosted by the American President for fellow leaders visiting New York for the annual United Nations meetings.

Вчора поспілкувалися з @RealDonaldTrump та @FLOTUS на Офіційному прийнятті від Президента США та Першої леді. Сьогодні продовжимо у робочому режимі! pic.twitter.com/8pnu5nHxgU — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) September 25, 2019

A photo posted by Zelensky on Twitter showed the two men with their spouses smiling broadly, without a hint of the controversy that now overhangs their relationship.

There have been conversations between US and Ukrainian officials this week about the matter, including over whether to release the log of the July phone call.

One official said there had not been extensive conversations between US and Ukrainian officials about what each leader would say during the open-press part of Wednesday's meeting, though they could not rule out more informal discussions, namely between Trump and Zelensky during the diplomatic reception or between Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his Ukrainian interlocutors.

Speaking during the meeting, Trump praised Giuliani, his private attorney, for pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, saying he was demonstrating admirable verve.

""Rudy Giuliani is a great lawyer, he was a great mayor, he's highly respected. I've watched the passion he's had on television over the last few days. Incredible what he's done,"" Trump said.

The sit-down between Trump and Zelensky on Wednesday was not originally meant to be their first meeting. Trump had agreed to meet Zelensky earlier this month in Poland, where he was planning to commemorate the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.

When a hurricane forced him to cancel his plans, Mike Pence went in his place and met with Zelensky in Warsaw . Afterward, Pence was asked whether the Biden matter arose in the talks. He said no, but did turn quickly to the issue of corruption in Ukraine.

Trump and Zelensky have spoken by phone twice: once immediately following Ukrainian elections in April, and again in July. The latter conversation has become the focal point for Democrats after an intelligence whistleblower raised concerns about Ukraine and Russia.

In the months following Zelensky's election, Trump showed little interest in meeting him, believing Ukraine to be an intractably corrupt country. He ascribed Russia's annexation of part of the country to his predecessor, who he repeatedly blamed for ""losing"" Crimea.

But as Giuliani began raising the issue of Biden and his son, Trump's interest was piqued. He was also convinced by top national security aides, including then-national security adviser John Bolton, that engaging the new leader would be valuable in countering Russia.

Bolton was also among those aides pushing Trump to approve an aid package worth millions of dollars to Ukraine after it was put on hold. That package -- and whether it was used as a bargaining chip in Trump's attempts to push an investigation into the Bidens -- has become a lynchpin in the impeachment inquiry."

The announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President.

""Today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" Pelosi said in a brief speech in the Capitol, adding, ""The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.""

""Actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,"" the House speaker said.

The House speaker, who has long pushed to keep her caucus away from the politically divisive issue, is responding to the seismic shift among Democratic members, following Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian President. Dozens of House Democrats -- many from moderate or Trump-won districts -- have announced their support for an impeachment inquiry over the past 48 hours.

""This week, the President has admitted to asking the President of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in her public remarks.

In advance of that statement, Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also announced plans to vote on a resolution of disapproval on Wednesday for allegations ""that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals -- and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation."" Their statement did not mention impeachment.

'Full speed ahead'

Pelosi consulted Tuesday afternoon with the six House Democratic leaders to discuss their presentation to the caucus later in the day, Democratic sources familiar with the issue said. In that closed-door meeting before her public announcement, Pelosi said the six chairmen will continue to investigate under a powerful new umbrella of an impeachment inquiry.

A separate source in the room said the speaker added, ""Here we are. A moment of truth. Truth is what this has been about all along.""

""He's taken it to another level of betrayal therefore we're moving forward with another level of inquiry,"" Pelosi said.

Behind the scenes, Pelosi has encouraged members of her caucus to state their impeachment position now in order to show there is a groundswell in the caucus. She is also conveying that message to freshmen.

On Tuesday, Pelosi also told the caucus that the impeachment inquiry will be done ""expeditiously,"" but wasn't specific in her timeframe, according to a source in the room.

Rep. Jackie Speier told CNN that the President's actions in regards to Ukraine were so egregious, that there has been a ""dramatic"" shift by Pelosi.

""I think she's very laser-focused on this offense as being so egregious that it warrants a full blown impeachment inquiry,"" she said.

Asked what the timeline is for this, she said, ""swiftly.""

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Tuesday after Pelosi's remarks, ""I only have one thing to say, full speed ahead.""

Tide changing for Pelosi allies and vulnerable House freshmen

Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday announced his support for impeachment proceedings, arguing that ""now is the time to act"" and any delay ""would betray the foundation of our democracy.""

""We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution,"" the Georgia Democrat said in a speech on the House floor . ""The future of our democracy is at stake.""

JUST WATCHED Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry 01:04

Some of Pelosi's closest allies, including House Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, have signaled their support for impeachment proceedings — a significant indicator that the speaker could be moving closer to backing the divisive political procedure.

Another crucial development has been multiple high profile freshmen Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016 either coming out publicly to fully endorse the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry or at least opening the door to proceedings , citing Trump's actions as forcing them to act.

One of those freshman Democrats, Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, stressed on CNN ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President."" But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts was ""just a line that I think was too much for all of us.""

Pelosi has cited the House members in GOP-leaning districts as part of her hesitance to embrace impeachment, and the groundswell of statements over the past 48 hours could signal a tipping point in the political calculus.

""If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government,"" Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan said in a statement Tuesday. Stevens had told CNN last month that she had ""mixed reviews from the people of my district"" on the issue of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.

So far, as many as 165 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to a CNN count, and that doesn't include the House Democrats who've said in recent days that the President's behavior is a turning point in Democrats' oversight into the administration.

Pelosi has, for months, resisted pursuing impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of House Judiciary, told CNN on Tuesday morning that he believes articles of impeachment are ""inevitable"" and said there's a ""growing clamor throughout the Democratic caucus"" to deal with Trump's ""reckless and lawless"" behavior.

Some holdouts remain

But some vulnerable Democrats in 2020 are still treading cautiously on the issue.

Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah told CNN on Tuesday that he's ""considering"" impeachment, but didn't want to discuss the issue further.

""Before making any judgments, I want to know the facts of what occurred between the President and Ukraine,"" McAdams said. ""I share Sen. (Mitt) Romney's view that If the President used his position to pressure a foreign power to dig up dirt on a rival for his own personal gain, it would be deeply troubling. I believe it would be a betrayal of the loyalty owed to our country and the Constitution.""

Rep. Max Rose, another endangered House Democrat, told CNN that he has not moved off his opposition to impeachment, but argued that ""we have to get to the facts"" of the allegations.

""It is impossible to not take these allegations seriously. It is a national security matter,"" the New York Democrat said Tuesday on Capitol Hill, adding, ""It's incredibly serious ... what I'm not going to do is jump to make another declaration.""

Asked if that meant he is opposed to moving ahead on impeachment, Rose said, ""My current position right now is clear, but that is not a justification to not take these points as seriously as possible.""

Rep. Susan Wild stood up during the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday and argued that Pelosi should cancel some of the upcoming two week recess to not lose momentum, according to a source in the room.

The House, at the end of the week, will recess for two weeks for a district work period over the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holidays.

CNN previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.

There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats.

Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call over the summer with Ukraine's president, but denied doing anything improper.

CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported this.

In her public remarks on Tuesday, Pelosi said, ""The law is unequivocal: it says the DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide congress the full whistleblower complaint,"" Pelosi said.

Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel's impeachment investigation. That vote came, however, as Democrats struggled to publicly define the committee probe with Nadler saying the committee is conducting an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had refrained from calling it that.

In a nod to the ongoing investigations in the House, Pelosi said on Tuesday, ""For the past several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so that the House can gather all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity, approval of articles of impeachment.""

The House Speaker also said in her speech, ""I can say with authority the Trump administration's actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and our protections of whistleblowers.""

But the Kentucky Republican and his fellow GOP senators did not explicitly commit to pushing for the full complaint turned over to the committee.

McConnell's pledge came the same day Trump announced he would release an ""unredacted transcript"" of the call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump encouraged the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

It also came on the same day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry to investigate the allegations.

On Monday McConnell blasted Democrats for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known.

The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to meet in a classified setting Thursday with the Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson where they will be asked to testify about what they know about the whistleblower complaint.

McConnell said the Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, would look into the issue.

""We're going to find out what happened. In the Senate, through a process pre-established through the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors initially with the acting director of DNI,"" McConnell said. ""I think that is the responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan way to proceed with what we think we know at this particular point.""

Burr was tight-lipped Monday about how his committee would respond to the complaint, although finally said he want to ""bring the interested parties in"" before the committee.

The top Democrat on the committee is Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

""This is one step in a process. This is an orderly process, where the Committee, the full Committee, will get a chance to hear from both the IC Inspector General, Mr. (Michael) Atkinson , and the Acting DNI, Admiral Maguire,"" Warner said. ""But again, we're going to take this one step at a time, and I think it's terribly important to get the facts.""

A Senate Democrat source told CNN that Democrats are trying to remain focused on obtaining the whistleblower complaint itself despite Trump's announcement Tuesday he will release the transcript from his call with Zelensky. The thinking is, per this source, that the concerns about Trump's conduct do not hinge completely on what is in the transcript.

Multiple sources have also noted that the Democrats maintain the acting DNI is required to provide the complaint to Congress by law.

The second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Thune, did not say if Republicans will insist the administration turn over the whistleblower's formal complaint.

""We'll know a lot more when the Intel Committee meets with them this week,"" Thune said. ""If it's an intelligence related issue then it probably falls under the committee's jurisdiction and I'm sure they will be anxious to get all those answers.""

Also Tuesday, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a resolution authored by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full compliant to Congress.

Schumer, D-New York, said the resolution was ""aimed at a recalcitrant executive branch, which has blocked the ability for the committees to see the complaint, even though the law requires it.""

McConnell said Republicans would go along with the resolution in the spirit that it would assist the Intelligence Committee conduct its investigation."

""If you're not walking the line, then you're out. That's just not right. That's not the party that my husband and I belonged to.""

According to the Post, a whistleblower complaint stemming from Trump's July phone conversation with the Ukrainian President that led to the impeachment inquiry ""includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations.""

The vote was 421 to 0 with two lawmakers voting present.

House Democrats announced plans to vote on the resolution Tuesday -- the same day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry -- in the wake of outrage over reports that the President pressured a foreign leader in an effort to target a political rival. It was not clear until late in the day on Wednesday when the complaint would be transmitted to the Hill, if at all.

The resolution, from House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, calls for the complaint to be turned over to the congressional intelligence committees.

The vote took place just hours after the White House released a transcript showing that President Donald Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. CNN has previously reported that the call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The whistleblower complaint about Trump's communications with Ukraine was hand delivered Wednesday afternoon to Capitol Hill for lawmakers to review.

Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he has started to read the document, but declined to give his initial thoughts.

Members of the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee are also reviewing the documents.

It's not just Democrats who have vowed to find out the details of the whistleblower complaint.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday ""we're going to find out what happened"" with respect to the complaint and said that he expects the Senate Intelligence Committee will conduct a ""responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan"" probe of the matter.

On Tuesday, the Senate also adopted by unanimous consent its own resolution authored by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full complaint to Congress.

Earlier on Wednesday ahead of the final vote on the resolution, the House adopted an amendment to its resolution offered by Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania to make it identical to the resolution passed the day before by the Senate.

Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced the vote on the resolution on Tuesday, saying in a joint statement that ""the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress's disapproval of the Administration's effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower.""

House Democratic caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference on Wednesday morning that the resolution would demand the release of ""the full and unredacted version"" of the complaint.

Mike Quigley on Wednesday described the whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's communications with Ukraine as ""deeply disturbing"" after viewing the document.

""I can't detail what it involves. Period,"" Quigley told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""I will tell people that it is deeply disturbing. It reinforces the concerns that what we previously learned and I think it is a blueprint for what we still need to know.""

Quigley asserted the whistleblower complaint ""is the political equivalent"" of Trump's claim during his 2016 presidential campaign that he could ""stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody"" without losing voters.

""What the President said during the campaign, he said he could shoot someone on the street and his base would stay with him. I guess what I read, to me, was the political equivalent of that: defying the constitution, committing a criminal act and thinking, 'Well I can get away with it,' "" he said. ""Some sort of bizarre cult of personality. Deeply disturbing what we read this morning. Alarming.""

The whistleblower complaint -- which was hand-delivered to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for lawmakers to review -- deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. A transcript of the conversation released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Maguire has faced immediate scrutiny in his role after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comply with a deadline to hand over the whistleblower complaint to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent.""

The whistleblower complaint deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.

On the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, word began to spread that Trump was reviewing a plan to cut foreign assistance to Ukraine.

(CNN) With Tuesday's announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Pelosi has finally put constitutional duty above perceived political expediency.

House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently slow-played the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding Ukraine scandal

Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's own admissions and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump suspended $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.

Trump and his defenders claim his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump stated Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection? Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries?

Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid.

Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could.

And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own original statement, made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son.""

So, what crimes could Trump be violation of?

Foreign election aid -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.

While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a leading contender to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?

Bribery -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself has drawn that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump has made clear that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.

Extortion is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The suspension of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.

Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office.

But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.

Impeachment need not be based on a crime. The Constitution prescribes impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be drawn from English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.

The Constitution separates impeachment from criminal prosecution. Draft articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to abuse of power for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine).

This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.

Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi is now changing course on impeachment.

By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Now, your questions

Lee, California: Does the House Intel Committee have a legal right to see the intelligence community whistleblower complaint about Trump?

On its face, the law is straightforward . If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- reviewed the complaint and found that it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.

But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI concluded that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President.

That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.

That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.

Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?

Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution explicitly grants the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.

In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus was impeached and convicted on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.

Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?

As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have openly contemplated utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact, nobody has ever been fined by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama convincingly argues that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.

While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would fight all the fines. Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up.

Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.

Three questions to watch

1) Will Pelosi finally see the light and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment?

2) Will House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff take the intelligence community whistleblower case to court?"

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

(CNN) The White House transcript of President Donald Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should cause Republicans to tremble. It reveals that the President did push Zelensky to investigate Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Before asking Zelensky to ""do us a favor"" by helping with this investigation, he reminded him that the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine.

This kind of stunning evidence of the President abusing his power is the reason that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally took the major step of throwing her full support behind the impeachment inquiry. The six committees currently investigating President Trump are now operating under one umbrella with the official mandate of determining whether to vote for articles of impeachment. Should they end up taking this vote, Trump would join a small list that includes only three other presidents who have faced impeachment since the establishment of the country (Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William J. Clinton).

The President has struck back in predictable fashion. ""A total Witch Hunt!"" and ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" were some of the first words to come in over the Twitter transom . A number of Republicans have already joined him. At the heart of the counterattack is the claim that impeachment is a radical action. The entire process, Republicans will likely continue to say, is being driven by a Democratic party motivated by its left-wing base. Trump will try to defeat Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats as President Clinton prevailed over Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in 1998

If Democrats want to retain the support of their moderate wing who have joined this cause and desire to stand any chance of winning over Republican support in the House or Senate, they will need to respond to these charges of harassment. Fortunately for Speaker Pelosi, in the case of Trump, supporters of impeachment have a series of cogent arguments to make to convince GOP members of Congress.

While much of the discussion has centered around the Democrats, the spotlight should be on the GOP. They are the party being tested. And there are four reasons why there is a clear conservative case for the impeachment of President Trump.

1. Restraining the power of presidents

Restraining presidential power should be a top priority for conservatives. Few recent presidents have exercised their power with the same level of reckless abandon as the current commander in chief. If Republicans mean what they say about championing limited government, then there really is no justification for the party's decisions since the time of Richard Nixon to continue granting power to the executive branch when their party was in power. Simply put, further empowering the President means growing the role of government. The fact that the President has so much authority, from the ability to send troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war to using executive measures to achieve policy goals like building a wall, does not square with their agenda.

Unlikely as it may seem, supporting impeachment is an unprecedented opportunity to reverse course on their hypocrisy and re-embody their own ideals. Trump has exposed, more than almost any of his recent predecessors, just how much a president can do if they are willing to ignore basic norms and if they are not scared about the potential response from Congress or the courts. Supporting the impeachment process, and possibly a decision to impeach and convict, could allow Republicans to go on record showing that they still do believe in small government.

2. Protecting national security

Protecting national security has also been a central goal of the conservative movement. During the 1980s, for instance, President Ronald Reagan railed against Democrats for being weak on defense as he pushed for higher defense spending and insisted on taking a tough stand with the Soviets. George W. Bush pushed for a proactive militaristic response to terrorist networks as well as states that he claimed threatened American interests. Yet President Trump has not done much to uphold this tradition. His coziness with Vladmir Putin has frustrated intelligence and military officials who understand that Russia has been conducting ongoing efforts to interfere in our electoral system.

The President has handled relations with North Korea in topsy-turvy fashion, doing little to produce an actual nuclear weapons agreement or halt North Korea's weapons production. His efforts to persuade Ukraine , possibly withholding military aid as an incentive to investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden, have inspired similar fears. All of this prompted seven moderate Democrats who are veterans of the military to publish their Washington Post piece endorsing the impeachment inquiry.

3. Standing up for the rule of law

Republicans have also loved to imagine that they are the party of law and order. Ever since Richard Nixon's time in office, they have tried to assure voters that they are the party that can be best trusted to follow the rule of law and to give law enforcement institutions all the support they need. Under the Trump administration, they have so far been sitting passively as a President ran roughshod over all the institutions they have claimed to champion. Throughout his presidency, Trump has peddled mendacity and offered disinformation contradicting solid intelligence data that has been collected on matters like Russia. He has repeatedly acted with disregard for the law, he's been accused of flagrantly obstructing justice while under investigation by Mueller and refused to cooperate fully with congressional oversight.

The current scandal was triggered by the fact that the administration did not share the whistleblower complaint with Congress, as is required by law. The accumulation of evidence that the President does not abide by the rule of law is overwhelming. Republicans can only show Americans they still care about this crucial aspect of our democracy if they cooperate with this investigation.

4. Mike Pence

In addition to these three core conservative elements behind the impeachment investigation, Democrats looking to forge bipartisan accord can reiterate that if President Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be replaced by an extraordinarily conservative Republican -- Vice President Mike Pence -- who is arguably even more rightward than the President. So if this really is a left-wing effort to mount a coup, it is poorly conceived. Success would not change the balance of partisan power nor would it in any way moderate the agenda of the White House.

Based on the voluminous evidence that we already have of Trump's wrongdoing, there is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles. In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for."

1. Impeachment inquiry

The notion that has floated around some Democratic circles since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, through months of Mueller report drama and endless cycles of controversy, was brought to light yesterday when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into the President's conduct. The move was made after Trump admitted to withholding aid to Ukraine before a scheduled call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump pushed Zelensky to look into dealings involving the son of his possible 2020 rival, Joe Biden. Trump insists the two things aren't related, and the White House as soon as today is expected to release a transcript of the Zelensky call and a whistleblower's report related to it.

Oh, and on top of it all, Zelensky and Trump are scheduled to have their first face-to-face meeting today on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. There could certainly be a lot to talk about.

2. Climate crisis

Before the impeachment news rocked the political sphere, President Trump singled out a very different adversary: Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. After the 16-year-old's fiery speech Monday at the UN, Trump responded to a video of her with a seemingly mocking message: ""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" Thunberg ended up using his words in her Twitter bio. Meanwhile, Fox News apologized to the teen after conservative pundit Michael Knowles called Thunberg ""a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left."" The show's other guest and host both admonished Knowles on air. Thunberg has Asperger's and has said her diagnosis is a ""superpower"" that helps her activism.

3. Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe's water crisis just got more desperate. The main water treatment plant in the capital city of Harare was shut down Monday, leaving 1 million people without tap water . Authorities are now scrambling to secure water purifying chemicals to keep up with the need for clean water, and people have resorted to digging makeshift wells on their property. Zimbabwe was hit by a severe drought between October 2018 and May. Besides the water crisis, the UN food agency says more than 2 million Zimbabweans face starvation.

4. Navy suicides

The US Navy has confirmed that three sailors assigned to the USS George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia died by suicide in ""separate incidents"" last week and has launched an investigation into their deaths. None of the deaths seem to be related, and the sailors all worked in different departments. Five sailors who were assigned to the carrier have died by suicide in the last two years. The Marine Corps and the Navy have been dealing with a spike in suicides recently. The number of confirmed and suspected suicides among the active duty ranks of the two branches reached a 10-year high in 2018. After last week's deaths, Capt. Sean Bailey, commanding officer of the USS George H. W. Bush, called for the naval community to come together ""to grieve, to support each other, and to care for those in need.""

5. Plácido Domingo

Opera legend Plácido Domingo has severed his artistic relationship with The Metropolitan Opera in New York after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him. According to the Met, the decision, which ends a 50-year professional relationship, was mutual. Domingo's image was removed yesterday from the ""Macbeth"" page on the Met Opera's official website. The show was set to open today, with Domingo in the lead role. In August, the Associated Press reported that nine women detailed alleged incidents of sexual harassment spanning three decades beginning in the late 1980s. In September, 11 more people came forward with allegations that included verbal harassment and groping.

(CNN) When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky greets United States President Donald Trump Wednesday in their first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the TV comedian-turned-politician must be wary and avoid being taken advantage of by the self-proclaimed master of the art of the deal.

At the same time, Zelensky must be circumspect and consider how Russian President Vladimir Putin might try to capitalize on Ukraine's being increasingly -- and unfairly -- portrayed as a cesspool of corruption.

The Trump-Zelensky meeting comes amid slipping support for Ukraine among Republican elected officials, at a time when Zelensky is deep in a high-stakes effort to bring Putin to the bargaining table. This diplomacy is part of an ambitious effort by Zelensky to make good on an election promise to end the deadly five-year military conflict with Russia in the east of the country.

Zelensky made that pledge on the premise he could count on the full security backing of the United States.

But that assumption is now at risk of falling apart for one main reason: Donald Trump.

In July, Trump, perhaps sensing weakness in the neophyte politician, allegedly tried to pressure Zelensky in a phone call to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. On Monday, CNN reported that about a week before the call took place, Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million in economic and military aid, possibly to extort Zelensky into investigating Biden's son. (Trump said Tuesday that he would release a full, unredacted transcript of the call on Thursday.)

Trusted diplomatic sources in Ukraine tell me that Zelensky will likely try to keep the meeting low-key and seek to extract an outcome that can be spun positively to the public. As Ukraine is currently in talks with the IMF for a three-year, $5 billion loan, officials might not be eager to upset the United States, one of the bank's key voting members.

Indeed, comments ahead of the meeting from Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister Vadym Prystaiko suggest that Ukraine is taking a go-softly approach with an emphasis on energy security and keeping bilateral relations robust while Ukraine remains in conflict with Russia.

But that's not good enough. Those in Trump's orbit have been issuing extraordinarily negative portrayals of Ukraine: Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump 2020 campaign, told CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Monday night that ""Ukraine has had a problem with corruption for some time,"" and Trump has asked , ""Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Given these negative portrayals in American media, the Ukrainian President needs to punch back hard -- harder than he's ever punched in his life. The negative image of Ukraine emerging from Trumpworld has played into the Russian narrative of Ukraine as a failed state, and could even give pretext to an opportunistic Kremlin for more military adventurism in Ukraine.

For Zelensky, the timing for the equivalent of a diplomatic knock-out punch is perfect, as Trump -- now dealing with a brand-new impeachment inquiry for allegedly using US taxpayer dollars, or at least the weight of his office, to pressure a foreign country to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival -- is in a significantly weakened state.

Calling out Trump would earn Zelensky respect worldwide, especially among European allies. Even more importantly, such a move would show strength to Putin at a time when Ukraine is tantalizingly close to gaining an upper hand with the Kremlin. In his first few weeks in office, Zelensky managed to negotiate a complex prisoner swap with Russia, with another reportedly in the works for October, and he may meet with Putin for the first time at an upcoming peace summit brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Further, given these high stakes, a hastily arranged meeting with Speaker Pelosi and the Congressional Ukraine Caucus could be beneficial in publicizing Ukraine's side of the story.

Astonishingly, Republican leaders, traditionally strong backers of Ukraine, have stayed silent while Trump has essentially thrown a country at war with Russia under the bus, placing Ukraine in an impossible position by withholding congressionally approved aid.

Ukrainian government officials are livid.

""The characterizations of levels of corruption in Ukraine are grossly inaccurate. With stalwart US assistance, Ukraine has done more in five years to turn its society and economy around than any other country anywhere,"" UkraineInvest chairman Daniel Bilak tells me. ""It's disappointing to hear these comments just as we are seeing a huge uptick in US investor interest in Ukraine since Zelensky's election. His government of young reformers is rolling out full-bore the most ambitious reform program in Ukraine's and perhaps the region's history.""

Even though some European countries are beginning to show weakening support for Ukraine (indeed, Macron wants a rapprochement with Russia), Ukraine is better off among European friends than working with an American administration that will do almost anything to win reelection -- including pressuring a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.

The timing is especially sensitive, as Ukraine prepares for a four-party peace summit later this fall, known as the Normandy Format and brokered by Macron. It's the best shot at a lasting peace deal Ukraine has had for a long time.

Of course, Ukraine wouldn't be where it is today without US economic and military aid, US help in avoiding crushing Russian sanctions, and US support for anti-corruption efforts. Ukraine has also benefited from crucial US backing in the UN Security Council. Contrary to claims by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that all the Obama administration did for Ukraine was to ""provide blankets,"" Washington extended $75 million in military aid in 2015, including Humvees and drones. Under Obama, the United States was the largest contributor of funds and personnel to the entity I used to work for, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. In the heady days of 2014, after Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and dispatched armed ""little green men"" to the Donbas, the mission relied heavily on guidance from US officials (as well as help from the Swiss).

But just because the United States has been a friend in the past does not mean Ukraine has to allow itself to be extorted and humiliated by a trusted ally.

When he was playing the Ukrainian president known as Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko in the Ukrainian TV comedy ""Servant of the People,"" Zelensky took a phone call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel in which she offered Ukraine membership in the European Union. The TV president exploded in a fit of joy.

Turns out Merkel had dialed the wrong number, and the news was meant for the president of Montenegro. In response, Holoborodko devolved into a profanity-laced meltdown.

The real Zelensky may want to remind himself of that made-for-TV defeat when he meets with Trump on Wednesday. The Ukrainian President should make sure he comes through with a win befitting his government of young reformers -- and the proud people of Ukraine who have suffered enough humiliation over the years from real enemies.

The business executive suggested Biden was freezing out the media so he would not have to address the mounting questions about his son’s business dealings China and Ukraine.

“Because not a lot of sons of politicians get $50,000 a month from foreigners to consult on energy policy with no prior energy experience,” Trump, Jr. wrote, adding: “Also investors (China) don’t give people with 0 investment experience $1,500,000,000… unless you’re buying them!”

Since announcing his presidential campaign, the former vice president has refused to discuss the ties his youngest son, Hunter, has cultivated overseas. Biden has remained silent on the topic, even though there is increasing evidence such dealings were made easier because of his political influence. As Peter Schweizer, a contributing editor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book— Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden profited off extraordinary deals that were unavailable to regular citizens.

In Ukraine, alone, the younger Biden secured a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of the country’s only independent oil and natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014. Hunter Biden received the position, which reportedly paid as much $83,000-a-month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry. Around the same time as the appointment, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Hunter Biden’s appointment and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption is at the center of the push for impeachment. Democrats claim that President Donald Trump allegedly broke the law by suggesting to the newly elected-president of Ukraine, Volodymr Zelensky, that he probe Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma.

The president has defended his conduct publicly, pointing out the inconsistencies and contradictions both Joe and Hunter Biden have told on the topic.

“The conversation I had was largely … [about] all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,” the president said on Saturday."

McCarthy spoke to Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday.

“Why aren’t we investigating Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?” asked Rep. McCarthy, “because I’ll promise you this: Hunter Biden — if his name was Hunter Smith, no one would’ve hired him. He wouldn’t have found a billion dollars in China, and an oligarch in Ukraine wouldn’t be hiring him.”

“But why do you have a vice president who’s running for president, who’s number one in the Democratic polls, bragging that he held Ukraine hostage to fire a prosecutor that was gonna investigate his own son?” continued the house minority leader. “Why isn’t anybody up in arms about that? And why is that not being investigated?”

Watch below:

Rep. McCarthy joined The Sean Hannity Show on Tuesday to discuss House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent announcement of the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” — which he described as simply Pelosi’s attempt to “appease the socialist wing of the [Democrat] Party.”

The Ukraine scandal involving Joe and Hunter Biden does, indeed, appear to be a touchy subject for Democrats. On Saturday, Joe Biden snapped at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, who asked the former vice president about his son’s involvement with Ukraine.

“Here is what I know,” said Biden, whilst pointing his finger repeatedly at Doocy. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader? If that’s what happened … that appears what happened.”

“You should be looking at Trump!” exclaimed Biden. “Ask the right questions!”

On Tuesday, Democrats saw to it that the media were looking at President Donald Trump after Pelosi announced a “formal impeachment inquiry” against the president in the wake of his reported comments regarding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Hunter Biden.

By Wednesday, however, the Democrats’ new strategy was of no avail, as the White House released the entire transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky, revealing that neither Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments, which disproves the claims Democrats made.

The former vice president made the announcement shortly after House Democrats signaled they would begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump for urging Ukraine’s government to probe Hunter Biden’s business dealings.

“If President Trump refuses to comply with congressional requests, then he “will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said, before refusing to address questions from reporters. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the natural gas company’s board of directors in April 2014, where he was purportedly paid more $83,000 a month, despite having no prior background in the energy industry.

At the same time, Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. More troubling is that the former vice president pressured the Ukrainian government in 2016 to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was known to be investigating the energy giant.

Given the appearance of a conflicts of interest and the contradicting stories Joe and Hunter Biden have spun on the topic, Trump has defended his calls for Ukraine to investigate.

Trump said on Saturday:

The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems.

Shortly before the former vice president drew the line in the sand on impeachment, Trump announced he would release the un-redacted transcript of his call with Ukraine’s newly-elected president. The released documents, however, are only likely to draw more scrutiny to the unanswered questions about the reasoning for Hunter Biden’s appointment to Burisma’s board of directors.

As evidenced by the former vice president’s decision to avoid the press on Thursday, such answers are likely not forthcoming.

Since announcing his presidential campaign, the former vice president has refused to discuss his son’s business ties to either Ukraine or China, despite mounting evidence such dealings were made easier because of his political influence. As Peter Schweizer detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden made a lucrative profit off extraordinary deals that were unavailable to regular businessmen.

“I mean, you look at — around the world, there are two countries where Joe Biden is the point person for the Obama administration: China and Ukraine, and in both cases, his son lands huge deals in both countries. I mean, what are the odds of that?” Schweitzer said during a recent interview on Fox & Friends."

“If you look back at Joe Biden’s history of running for national office, he’s been in a safe seat in Delaware since 1972, so he doesn’t get challenged on these issues,” said Schweizer of Biden’s false public statements. “Whenever he runs for national office, he comes up with these stories that are supposed to indicate some level of truth and what kind of person he is, but he always sort of exaggerates, and he even does it with some of the worst stories.”

Schweizer continued, “Everybody is familiar with the tragic story of [Joe Biden being] elected to the Senate and then his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident — and there’s a lot of reporting on this by some news outlets — of how the original [and] accurate story is that this driver sort of lost control of his car and this tragedy happened, and the man responsible for this accident felt haunted about it for the rest of his life. Well, over the course of decades, Joe Biden has added the fact — which is completely false — that this guy was a drunk driver, so he’s even taken a tragedy involving his family to try to make it seem more favorable to him.”

“The victim narrative,” replied Marlow, describing Biden as seeking political advantage through misrepresenting personal tragedy.

Shweizer concluded, “[Joe Biden] does the same thing with these embellishments involving ‘Corn Pop‘ or whoever else.”

“It’s pathological,” determined Marlow. “These guys are all such liars. This guy is a serial liar and we act like [Donald Trump] is the first one who’s ever told a fib in all of Washington.”

LISTEN:

In January, Politico described Biden’s public misrepresentation of the facts surrounding the deaths of his first wife and daughter as part of a pattern of “gaffes” in which he “altered the narrative”:

Some of [Joe Biden’s] confidants [claim] that Biden’s grief contributed to his propensity for impolitic, loose-lipped gaffes—life is short, let it rip—including two public instances in which he altered the narrative of the deadly wreck by suggesting inaccurately the other driver was drunk. Overall, though, and over time, Biden has managed to turn his grief into a sort of interpersonal gift. … In 2001, the week following the September 11 attacks, Biden gave a speech at the University of Delaware to a crowd of more than 2,700. He told them to not be afraid. He told the students their generation was up to the task to fight this fight. And he grieved for the people who had gotten a call saying their loved ones were dead, just like that, there in the morning, now gone forever. Once, he said, he had gotten that call. “It was an errant driver who stopped to drink instead of drive and hit—a tractor-trailer—hit my children and my wife and killed them,” he said. Six years later, in a very different context, in Iowa for a second attempt at running for president, he relayed a similar rendering of the accident. “Let me tell you a little story,” he said to a quiet crowd in Iowa City. “ … a guy who allegedly—and I never pursued it—drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch, broadsided my family … ” The problem was it wasn’t true. The driver of the truck, Curtis C. Dunn of Pennsylvania, was not charged with drunk driving. He wasn’t charged with anything. The accident was an accident, and though the police file no longer exists, coverage in the newspapers at the time made it clear that fault was not in question. For whatever reason, Neilia Biden, who was holding the baby, ended up in the right of way of Dunn’s truck coming down a long hill.

The Newark Post highlighted Biden’s false claims regarding the details of the aforementioned car accident:

According to Delaware Superior Court Judge Jerome O. Herlihy, who oversaw the police investigation 36 years ago as chief prosecutor, there is no evidence supporting Biden’s claim. “The rumor about alcohol being involved by either party, especially the truck driver (Dunn), is incorrect,” Herlihy said recently. … Biden has been alluding to alcohol being involved in the crash for nearly a decade. During a speech in 2001, Biden told an audience at University of Delaware that a drunken driver crashed into his family. He told a similar story during a public appearance in 2007.

No charges were made against Curtis C. Dunn, the driver of the tractor trailer Neilia Biden crashed into.

The president redirected every question about his decision to suspend aid to Ukraine, and his conversations with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, to question the Biden family and their actions in the country.

“There was never any quid pro quo,” he said, referring to the aid. “Unlike Biden, who by the way what he said was a horror.”

The president pointed at Biden’s son Hunter, who made $50,000 a month while serving on a Ukranian energy board while the former Vice President used threats of withdrawing aid to force the firing of a prosecutor which was also investigating the company paying his son.

“Ask how his son made millions of dollars from Ukraine, millions of dollars from China even though he had no expertise whatsoever,” Trump said.

The president spoke about the issue during a bilateral meeting with United Kingdom Prime Minster Boris Johnson.

Trump commented as a growing number of House Democrats joined calls to impeach the president for abuse of power, driving a narrative that Trump suspended aid to Ukraine to force leaders in the country to investigate Biden.

The president said that he suspended aid to Ukraine, because he felt that other countries should help pay for their aid, not just the United States.

“Why is the United States the only one paying to Ukraine?” Trump asked. “Why isn’t it Germany? … Why isn’t it France?”

The president said he finally consented to deliver the aid to Ukraine after aids and allies urged him to act.

He reminded the press that he sent the best military aid to Ukraine, as they faced threats from Russia-backed forces.

“President Obama used to send pillows and sheets, I sent anti-tank weapons and a lot of things to Ukraine,” Trump said.

Earlier in the day, Trump responded to a growing number of Democrats calling for his impeachment, accusing him of abusing his power to investigate political opponents.

“I think it’s ridiculous. It’s a witch hunt. I’m leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me. The only way they can try is through impeachment,” he replied."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

The conversation had become controversial after Trump urged the Ukrainian government to probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country.

“Now that the President has authorized the release of the transcript of his call with President Zelensky, we call on Biden to release the transcripts of his calls as Vice President with Ukrainian and Chinese leaders while his son was conducting shady business deals in those countries,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said.

The move comes as Joe Biden is embroiled in controversy over his son’s business dealings with foreign governments. In Ukraine, alone, the younger Biden secured a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of the country’s only independent oil and natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014.

Hunter Biden received the position, which reportedly paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry. Around the same time, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Hunter Biden’s appointment and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption is at the center of the rush by House Democrats to impeach Trump. Many on the left claim Trump allegedly broke the law by suggesting to the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, that he probe into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma.

Joe Biden, himself, echoed that sentiment on Wednesday during a public press conference.

“If President Trump refuses to comply with congressional requests, then he will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said, before refusing to address questions from reporters. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor for Breitbart News, detailed in his book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden profited off extraordinary deals in countries like Ukraine and China that were unavailable to regular citizens.

That is unconstitutional and illegal, it’s also a violation of campaign finance laws. In addition, if the whistleblower complaint is correct — that Donald Trump had delayed military aid in order to extract leverage to get the Ukrainian leader to investigate Trump’s political opponent — that would be another article of impeachment that would look just like bribery. And third, depending on whether or not the White House provides the whistleblower’s complaint in full, it is illegal for them not to provide it in full. The law’s very clear that you must provide this complaint to Congress.

SAAGAR ENJETI: The underlying problem here was, of course, Hunter Biden receiving $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian energy company. Do you think that is evidence of corrupt behavior?

“It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath,” Biden said in a lengthy statement following the White House’s release of the July 25th conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,” he continued.

According to the transcript, President Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden’s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy firm where his son Hunter was a board member. The former vice president bragged about the prosecutor’s ouster before the Council of Foreign Relations last year, saying that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the investigator was removed.

Numerous congressional Democrats expressed support for impeachment after the call between President Trump and Zelensky came to light, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to formally launch an impeachment inquiry.

Though Biden did not mention impeachment in his statement, the presidential candidate said he supports Democrats’ efforts to help the president “accountable.”

“Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,” he said. “In the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America’s families.”

During a joint press conference at the United Nations Wednesday, Zelensky denied that President Trump pressed him to probe Hunter Biden.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” he said.

When it was President Trump’s time to speak, he maintained that he applied “no pressure whatsoever” on Ukraine.

“Part of the problem you have is you have the fake news, you have a lot of corrupt reporting,” Trump added, once again denouncing the Ukraine call as “the single greatest witch hunt in American history.”"

Transcript as follows:

MARK LEVIN, AUTHOR “UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS”: My take is the Biden family is corrupt. My take is that Joe Biden obstructed justice. You want to find obstruction. There it was. My take is that he blackmailed that government to get that prosecutor removed. And not just to protect his son, but to protect his future running for President of the United States.

And you have a massive Democrat scandal here. That’s why the media are conducting themselves the way they are. That’s why the Democrats are trying to turn this insight out to immunize Biden and to attack Trump but it won’t work. You see, Trump came into office a very, very rich man, and he’ll leave office a very, very rich man.

Joe Biden came in a very poor man. And then he left office a very rich man as did his family. Look how the media have covered this. First, we heard that Trump pressured Ukrainian President to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and held up military aid. The Wall Street Journal says, “well, not exactly.” Trump pressured the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, but there was no quid pro quo.

Then, we get the whistle-blower complaint being withheld from Congress. And Nancy Pelosi is very angry about that, that’s great. That takes us to impeachment territory. Justice Department and the DNI say, “No.” There we find out really there is no whistle-blower. There is some guy who heard something or read something but wasn’t in on the President’s conversation.

By the way, I am sick and tired of this President’s conversation with foreign leaders been leaked to the media and Democrats on Capitol Hill. I don’t remember a damn one of those happen at all to Obama or any other President. Our President has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place.

Now, Ukraine, through their foreign minister, denies that Trump pressured them. But you see it doesn’t fit their narrative. Now, let’s take a look at what took place with Biden. By the way, we need a Special Counsel. I have an idea. We should appoint a Special Counsel and make sure all the assistant special councils either donated to the Trump campaign or worked into the Trump campaign because only then will we have an honest investigation.

Make sure the issue of really thick report. That’s what they should to do. Exhibit one, our buddy Peter Schweizer, this is April 16, 2014, Devin Archer Hunter Biden’s business partner made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with the Vice President Biden. Five days later, Biden landed in Kia for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials.

Soon thereafter, the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund found more than a billion dollars into the Ukrainian economy. The next day a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, the fist went Hunter Biden would join the board. Hunter Biden has no background in energy, no background in anything really, other than being the son of a Vice President and other things of that sort.

Now, that’s exhibit one. Exhibit two. This is from The Washington Examiner. John Kerry’s stepson. Oh, it was precious to see John Kerry on TV Sunday attacking Trump, defending Biden when his own stepson has something to answer for it too.

His stepson rushed to play damage control to State Department after his business partner, Hunter Biden sealed the incestuous relationships, cut a deal with oligarch owned Ukrainian Gas Company in 2014, the one we just mentioned. An email released to The Washington Examiner shows that Biden’s decision to join the board of this Ukrainian company sparked immediate concern within his inner circle about the political optics.

Biden’s father, Joe was then Vice President, so they’re very concerned of this point. We have our friend, John Solomon; Biden had made no mention of his son and his 2018 speech that you saw in the video there where he says he stepped in. Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board was rightly reported. So in other words, everybody knew it.

Now, I could go on and on and on. But here’s the deal. Here’s my problem. Where the hell are the Republicans in the Senate? Do you know we control the Senate? Do you know how we control the Senate Intelligence Committee?

Our good friend Lindsey Graham, are you not Chairman to the Senate Judiciary Committee? Then why the hell aren’t you issuing subpoenas like Elijah Cummings? Why the hell aren’t you issuing subpoenas like Jerry Nadler and all the rest of them? Why aren’t you getting to the bottom of this? You have real live corruption, obstruction, blackmail that’s what Ukraine. Wait till we get to China $1.5 Billion. I don’t care what the media thinks. See that over my shoulder? “Unfreedom of the Press”.

We know that they’re incapable of covering this because of their ideology. But the truth shall set us free. I understand what the Democrats are doing in the House. I understand. They want to destroy the President. They are using their committee as opposition research. They are settling the wagon they’re trying to immunize Biden.

What’s going on in the Republican Senate? Subpoenas, under oath testimonies. Why don’t you issue subpoenas for the Biden bank accounts like they do with Trump? Or call in his accounts like they do with Trump? Or Hunter Biden, we can’t touch him but Don, Jr., and Eric and Jerry Kushner and Ivanka? They are free game? Hell, no. We should turn the script. Here’s the difference. Biden is corrupt. Trump is not."

Schweizer highlighted the Jeff Bezos-owned news media outlet’s broad omissions in reporting on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings during his father’s tenure as vice president.

“If you are a reader of the Washington Post, and that is really your main source of news, you would have absolutely no idea what this whole Biden thing and his son thing is about, because they’re never really reported anything on it,” Schweizer said, noting that “a lot of news outlet’s” similarly ignore findings related to the Biden family’s foreign businesses. “They’ve never reported on the massive deals that Hunter Biden got in China.”

Schweizer noted Hunter Biden’s salary while sitting on the board of director of Burisma, a Ukraine-based energy company. “They have done very little reporting on the Ukraine controversy and what it entails. The dollar amount — the $83,000 a month — which we know … from court documents. Hunter Biden’s business partner was charged with fraud in an unrelated case, so it’s all there in black and white how much he was getting paid, but none of that is reported by the media. You have to ask yourself, ‘Why?’. These are news outlets. This is news, that the vice president of the United States’ son is cashing in in a major way in two countries around the world that are central to U.S. foreign policy while his dad is vice president. You don’t think readers are interested in that? It’s mind-boggling to me from the standpoint of the black hole of news coverage by some news outlets on this subject is astonishing to me.”

LISTEN:

“It’s very legitimate to look into activities [and] self-enrichment taking place while Joe Biden — in his official duties — was vice president of the United States,” determined Schweizer. “That’s something that should not be just written off because people think it’s inconvenient, or politically motivated. Let’s just get the facts out, follow the money, and see exactly what happened.”

Many news media outlets marketing themselves as non-partisan and politically objective operate double standards based on partisan political considerations, observed Schweizer. “Imagine looking forward, say in 2025, we have a Democratic president … and somebody were to argue or allege that one of the Trump children got a beneficial deal. That individual would probably be hailed as a hero for wanting that to be looked into, but for some reason there are different standards for different people.”

“They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal,” Schweizer said last week of the Washington Post‘s and other news media outlets’ framing of an alleged “whistleblower.”

Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father directed $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine as vice president during the Obama administration.

Hunter Biden also consummated financial relationships with foreign states and oligarchs in China and Ukraine while his father “steered [foreign] policy” towards those two countries as vice president, noted Schweizer in May.

In August, Schweizer explained how Hunter Biden helped facilitate China’s acquisition of Henniges Automotive — a formerly America-based company developing “dual-use” technologies with military applications — by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-run military contractor. AVIC acquired Henniges in 2015 with a 51 percent stake purchase. The remaining 49 percent was purchased by Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), a private equity firm founded by Hunter Biden and funded with $1.5 billion from the Chinese government via the Bank of China.

The younger Biden, who has a history of getting rich from entities tied to his father, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump’s part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son’s tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption.

The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company’s board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company’s board of directors.

At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden’s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden’s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father’s position as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

The poor optics not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden’s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma.

More troubling, however, is an episode that took place in 2016, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the country’s top prosecutor.

Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

Since making his initial statement in Iowa, Joe Biden has reverted back to his long held position of refusing to discuss his son’s dealings publicly. The silence has left a lot of unanswered questions about Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

The question is all the more important given Hunter Biden’s history of profiting from his father’s political connections. As Breitbart News reported, the younger Biden scored a job fresh out of law school with his father’s top campaign contributor. In 1996, Hunter Biden was hired for an undisclosed position with MBNA, which at the time was one of the nation’s largest credit card companies.

The job raised eyebrows from good government groups as MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations. Hunter Biden would continue working for MBNA in one capacity or another until the mid-2000s, while his father was writing bankruptcy legislation favored by the company."

The expected announcement comes as more than two-thirds of House Democrats now say they support impeachment in light of President Trump confirming that he suggested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky probe Hunter Biden during a congratulatory telephone call in July. Pelosi will reportedly announce the new inquiry after the Democratic caucus’ meeting at 4:00 p.m. EST.

Earlier Tuesday, President Trump said he ordered White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold tens of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine a week before he telephoned Kiev’s leader.

Before making his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Tuesday, the president told reporters he gave the order because he felt other allied nations weren’t providing enough.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

While still at the United Nations, President Trump later announced that he would release the full transcript of his phone call with Zelensky.

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” the president tweeted.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!” he added.

Though numerous congressional Democrats are now demanding an impeachment inquiry to be opened due to the Trump-Zelensky call, it remains unclear if the president broke the law by asking for an inquiry to be made into the Biden family. Further, the alleged “whistleblower” who reportedly claims to possess knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky, did not hear the pair’s conversation first hand.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham hit out at reports regarding Pelosi’s expected announcement, saying in a statement “the Democrats continue to weaponize politics when they should be working on behalf of their constituents, which is nothing new.”

“President Trump is working hard on behalf of our country here in NYC while they continue to scream the word impeachment. Nothing new here,” added Grisham.

UPDATE — 4:55 p.m. EST: According to Politico, Pelosi told Democrats during Tuesday’s caucus meeting: “It would be my intention with the consent of this caucus … to proceed with an impeachment inquiry. He is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign, that is a betrayal of his oath of office.”

UPDATE — 5:07 p.m. EST: At a Capitol Hill press conference House Speaker Pelosi officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump: “The House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry. The President must be held accountable; no one is above the law,” she said.

Many congressional Democrats are calling for an impeachment investigation against President Trump, based on news reports that the president pressured Zelensky to investigate the Biden family, though it is unclear if he broke the law by asking for a new inquiry to be made. Further, The alleged “whistleblower” who reportedly claims to have knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky, did not hear the pair’s conversation first hand.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Tuesday that she will make an announcement this afternoon after she meets with House chairmen and members of the Democrat caucus. According to NBC analyst Howard Fineman, the speaker will announce a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump and suggest that she herself supports Congress removing the president.

THE ATLANTIC’S JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Is according to what we’re getting on the screen — there’s a little bit of what you might call now a breaking tweet from the president — who says that tomorrow they will release a transcript of the Zelensky call. So my question to you is, if you see that transcript and it’s more benign than we’re lead to believe, do you think that your caucus might stand down a little bit or do you think the caucus is at a boil right now?

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: No, it’s not about. This is about the constitution of the United States. We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public. It’s really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid pro quo in the conversation.

If the president brings up, he wants them to investigate something of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right. We don’t ask foreign governments to help us in our elections. That’s what we try to stop with Russia. It’s wrong. It’s not only about how to make decisions about our foreign policy and global security, it’s about undermining the integrity of our election.

I don’t think there’s a — I don’t know. I don’t think there’s a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense, but if you have sequencing, like a couple of days before the President withdrew the bipartisan support for Ukraine. Bipartisan enthusiastic support for Ukraine a few days earlier, he withdraws it, then makes this statement.

President’s words weigh tons. And just bringing up the election is bad enough. That there would be a quid pro quo isn’t necessarily in the conversation, but in the sequencing. So this is not a good thing for a democracy, for the leader of the free world to be talking like that, and I don’t even know if there are any scruples involved. That’s why I say they think lawlessness is a virtue and now want to export it to another country."

Huntsman said, “As you guys know, I’ve been wary about this from the time it was trickling out last week because, one, we didn’t have all the facts, the media doesn’t always get it right, and it was the same Democrats calling for impeachment before he even got in office. I was, like, let’s just take a breath. The more I’m learning about this, and I think other people are learning about it, this is really alarming. Now we have more of the facts and the president himself even admitted it, but in my opinion, this is extortion.”

She continued, “I was trying to compare it to something in our life. He really was withholding the money, saying he was wanted Paris — he wanted France and Germany to pay for it. Why didn’t he tell Congress at the time that was the reason why? But if you have a boss that says, go do something for me, something that you don’t want to do, you know that they hold the cards, that if you don’t do it, you risk not getting paid, you risk getting fired. And Ukraine, they didn’t have the money that they needed, that they were promised they were going to get, so in that case he may say, I’m not pressuring you, but they know if you don’t do what I’m telling you to do, you will not be in a good position.”

She added, “I think, as a country, we should take a step back again and say, what should our president do that we should be proud of? Is this something we can stand by?”

She declared him to be as a result of that the “least patriotic of any president” in the history of the United States.

Harris said, “The president of the United States has confessed that he is attempting to collude with a foreign government to yet again manipulate the elections process of our country.

She added, “Clearly Donald Trump does not understand that his responsibility as president is also as commander in chief. But repeatedly we have seen Donald Trump as a so-called commander-in-chief because I don’t think he really fully understands the job. He takes the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community. He takes the word of a North Korean dictator over the word of the American intelligence committee. He takes the word of a Saudi prince over the word of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I’m heartened to see that people who sit on the Intelligence Committee are approaching this with a bipartisan spirit, knowing that this is about the country’s national security.”

“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” he wrote on Twitter.

The president announced his decision as more House Democrats meet to discuss impeachment proceedings to check what they believe is an unprecedented abuse of executive power. Some House Democrats, such as Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), have already made up their minds to support impeachment.

Since an anonymous “whistleblower” made public allegations that Trump acted inappropriately in a call with Ukraine by asking about investigating his potential opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, Democrats have demanded further details about his conversation.

But Trump says he had nothing to hide.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” he wrote.

Establishment media and Democrats are driving the narrative that the president purposefully withheld federal aid to Ukraine in an effort to strong-arm leaders into an investigation of the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden. Trump has denied the allegations.

“No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump wrote, referring to Biden’s Ukraine scandal. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”"

Wallace said, “The fact is that President Trump and his staff have really said quite a lot since Sunday in trying to explain or defend what they did that puts a lot of meat on the bones. The fact that the president says that in that congratulatory phone call with the president-elect at that time of Ukraine, he did talk about Joe Biden. He did talk about Joe Biden and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concern about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that. We also know, because it was admitted today by Kellyanne Conway, the story that was on the front page of The Washington Post, that the president did ask acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, before he made that phone call in July, to stop the provision of military aid to Ukraine, which had been overwhelmingly passed by Congress that everyone seemed in the government to want and the president said that he wanted it to be stopped.”

He continued, “So the two parts of the basic story here — that the president wanted Biden investigated, and that he had previously stopped aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine — those have been confirmed by the administration. The president denies that it was a quid pro quo.”

He added, “It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there’s going to be something here for Congress to investigate, whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don’t know.”

JOHN SOLOMON: While talking to senior U.S. diplomats today, overseas in Europe, I learned that on April 22, 2014, less than three weeks before the Burisma Holdings announced that Hunter Biden was joining their board, Vice President Joe Biden met with the prime minister of Ukraine. And in that meeting, according to a transcript, which I obtained tonight, Joe Biden specifically encouraged the Ukrainians to expand natural gas production with the help of Americans coming to the country. He set up the exact scenario that Hunter Biden just a few weeks earlier cashed in on.

SEAN HANNITY: Woah, this now takes things to a whole new level, because now, he’s basically doing the bidding for his own son’s wealth creation. Maybe even his son would share with his father.

SOLOMON: Those are the questions that Ukrainians are trying to answer back in 2016 before the prosecutor was fired, Sean. And they never got to the bottom of that. But I do think the evidence that the Ukrainians possess and would like to give to the U.S. Justice Department, it’s sitting there to be hand over. Someone from the Justice Department could pick it up tomorrow.

HANNITY: You also broke the story how Ukraine wanted to get us specific information about —

SOLOMON: Yes.

HANNITY: The Democratic National Committee, the Democrats, looking for Ukraine to help interfere in the 2016 elections. Tell us about that.

SOLOMON: That’s right. Yes, listen, the former ambassador to Ukraine, Ambassador Chaly — excuse me, the former Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Chaly told me on the record, in a statement that in the spring of 2016, a Democratic National Committee aide came to him, a contractor, and asked him to do two things. One, to turn over any intelligence they have in their intelligence files linking Donald Trump or Paul Manafort to Russia. And two, when Ukraine’s president came to visit the United States later in the year, in the middle of that 2016 election, they wanted him to make a statement.

HANNITY: Oh, wait a minute.

SOLOMON: Yes.

HANNITY: Well, so the Democrats were looking to get the Ukrainians to interfere in our elections.

SOLOMON: Before they were against it, they appeared to have been for it.

HANNITY: And they want to give us that information. All right. Peter Schweizer, let me go to you, if I may. You wrote Secret Empires. Fill in the gaps here from what you’ve heard from John, and also, you might want to add a little color to the story, which is Hunter Biden takes a trip to Asia with his father. And about 14 days after, he is doing a billion-dollar deal in private equity, and he has no background history with China or private equity, does he?

PETER SCHWEIZER: Yes, that’s right, Sean. I mean, what you see here is a pattern that emerged during the Obama administration. Joe Biden became point person to two countries, in particular, Ukraine and in China. And in both cases, his son cashed in. Ukraine, we’ve talked about, he was basically getting $83,000 a month as part of his consulting fee for Burisma, this corrupt energy company. In China, he travels with his father in December aboard Air Force Two. While his father is meeting with Chinese officials, Hunter Biden is doing we don’t know what. But the evidence becomes clear because ten days after they return to Washington, his small boutique investment firm, Rosemont Seneca, gets a $1 billion deal. That’s $1 billion with a “B,” later expanded to $1.5 billion. And that deal is with the Chinese government. It’s a deal that nobody else has in China. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, nobody.

HANNITY: So, this is 14 days after he flew with his dad on Air Force Two.

SCHWEIZER: Yes.

HANNITY: And well, can you confirm that he had no prior experience with Ukraine, oil, gas, or energy? Did he have any experience with China or private equity? Because I would think Goldman Sachs or one of the big banks would probably be a better candidate.

SCHWEIZER: Yes, I think they would, Sean. No background in China. He’s limited in private equity, was very limited. It was a hedge fund he was involved in with his uncle James Biden that ended up with massive lawsuits involving allegations of fraud. So, any experience he has in private equity is certainly not the type that the Chinese would have interested in. And the bottom line here, Sean, is that in both the case of Ukraine and China, we have paper trails. This is not like the Russian dossier, where somebody sort of said this is what happens. I know this is what happened. We have the financial records that Hunter Biden got from Ukraine. John has the ledger from Burisma itself. We know the visits."

In a statement, Pelosi accused President Trump of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

The transcript, released earlier Wednesday, shows President Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Democrats have latched on to the request, claiming the president appeared to have threatened to hold back military aide from Ukraine unless it investigated the Biden family.

“The release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,” said Pelosi.

On Tuesday, President Trump said he asked White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold the aid from Ukraine roughly one week before he spoke with Ukraine’s leader.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said ahead of his address before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

During a press conference on Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry in light of the Trump-Zelensky.

“I’m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of an impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable,” she stated.

President Trump on Tuesday blasted Pelosi’s decision to begin proceedings to oust him from the Oval Office, tweeting: “There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have.”

“The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,” he added. “They get nothing done.”"

Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

“I think it’s clear that a lot of [Democrat] policies — and particularly the stridency with which they are promoted — scare a lot of people, even the people who don’t like President Trump,” assessed Olsen.

LISTEN:



Olsen continued, “[Full-wokeness] would mobilize every Trump supporter to make sure they get out and vote, because the combination of economic policies and the cultural stridency unites every wing of the Trump coalition.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) record of supporting “full-woke” positions will become a political liability in a presidential election, determined Olsen.

“I have a hard time seeing how Warren can avoid that,” speculated Olsen. “She might want to campaign on the economy, but on the other hand, she’s already gone full-woke. She’s already called for reparations. She’s already said that the border should be decriminalized, [and] that there should be no such thing as illegal immigration. She’s already embraced radical positions on abortion.”

Olsen added, “It’s very hard to see how [Elizabeth Warren] avoids talking about that, because you know that the president and Republicans will remind her over and over and over again. I think she’s already stepped into that, so to speak, and it’s going to be hard for her to extricate herself.”

Trump’s greatest political threat is from a Democrat nominee who escapes “full-wokeness,” said Olsen.

“The most formidable opponent [for Donald Trump] is anyone who doesn’t scare the middle,” Olsen stated. “Right now, [Joe Biden] is avoiding full-wokeness. He’s talking about things in a way where he goes part of the way, but he doesn’t go all the way there.”

Joe Biden may move further left over the course of the Democrats’ presidential nomination process, noted Olsen.

“It’s not clear that the Biden we’re seeing now is the Biden we’re going to see in February,” Olsen said. “Will he move left — and sharply left — to get himself the nomination? I don’t know. And I think that if Biden does, then that — plus his notable penchant for gaffes and his obvious inability to maintain a steady debate performance across an entire two hours — will eventually be questions that voters will consider.”

Mansour highlighted a recent focus group of female swing voters examining Warren’s political appeal, inviting Olsen’s analysis on the Massachusetts senator’s likability.

Warren’s “demeanor,” arraigned Olsen, is unappealing to a broad swathe of the electorate.

“I’ve been watching the Democratic debates, and the thing that strikes me — as a former graduate of a well-ranked law school — is how much she reminds me of what she actually is, which is a law professor,” Olsen expressed.

Olsen continued, “The same demeanor of ‘the professor’s always right,’ staring straight out as if you were looking at a class with 200 students in it, and conducting the sort of pointed discussion that really doesn’t admit of discussion.”

Olsen went on, “Unfortunately, the election is not a classroom where students have to agree with you or be quiet. … In an election, people decide whether or not they like the person at the front of the room, and it doesn’t surprise me that a lot of people who don’t already agree with her positions — not just the populist positions, but the whole demeanor of ‘everything is awful and needs to be thrown upside down’ — [don’t] find her terribly attractive, particularly people who don’t have college degrees.”

Pelosi announced Tuesday she would begin an impeachment inquiry of the president after a whistleblower claimed using secondhand knowledge that the president held an inappropriate call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for corruption.

News of Trump’s decision to freeze aid to Ukraine before eventually relenting raised accusations from Democrats he was holding it ransom until the Ukrainian government investigated Biden. The president has denied this, promising to release a transcript of the phone call with Zelensky on Wednesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” he wrote on Twitter.

President Trump is expected to meet with Zelensky on Wednesday, as he continues participation in the United Nations summit in New York City.

Trump also expressed optimism on Tuesday that American voters would see through Pelosi’s effort to impeach him.

“The good news is the voters get it,” he said. “This is why they say it’s good for the election, but you know what? It’s bad for the country, what she’s doing is very bad.”"

The inspector general’s report has, thus far, been withheld by the administration.

Democrats allege that the Trump administration is violating the law in keeping the report from Congress, which was the chief reason cited Tuesday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for changing her mind and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

It is not clear why the administration had withheld the report, though the White House announced Tuesday that it will release the report Wednesday, along with the transcript of Trump’s conversation with the new president of Ukraine.

Henry, citing a “senior official” with first-hand knowledge of the inspector general’s report, said that the anonymous “whistleblower” — who did not hear Trump’s conversation directly — was biased in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 opponents, though the official did not say which one.

Henry also said the official had told him that there would be no “smoking gun” in the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — even though there would be “at least a few words” in it that would cause unspecified problems for the White House.

Hannity added that his sources had also told him that Trump and Zelensky had only briefly discussed the aborted investigation into a company on whose board Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, had served. Biden boasted last year that he had forced the Ukrainian prosecutor out by threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid.

Schiff’s announcement follows rumblings of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) intention to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump, using the alleged whistleblower’s accusations as a basis to formally launch the probe. As reported, the alleged whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation.

As Breitbart News reported:

It is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case. The alleged “whistleblower” in the case did not hear his conversations with Ukrainian leaders directly, and the Wall Street Journal has suggested there was no quid pro quo — that Trump did not offer (or withhold) anything in return.

Trump told reporters over the weekend that his conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was “largely congratulatory.”

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said of his conversation with Zelensky.

Trump announced on Tuesday that he authorized the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted” transcript of the conversation.

Trump announced:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine……..You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call.

Now that the transcript has been released, it’s the New York Times that doesn’t want anyone to see it.

The transcript I’d like to see is the one of Nancy Pelosi reading the Trump transcript.

F@@@@@@CK! Whose f***ing idea was it to demand this goddamn transcript?

F@CK!

F@@CK!

F@@@CK!

The absolute worst version for Trump — i.e. the one being repeated non-stop on MSNBC — is that he did exactly what Obama and Biden were doing to Ukraine: intimidating an ally into giving us something in exchange for the foreign aid we were giving them.

Biden himself bragged about getting Ukraine’s prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold a big fat check from them.

The Democrats’ argument is: No, no, no! When WE were pressuring Ukraine, we were doing it for good! Don’t you understand? We’re good; they’re bad.

The other reason the media are going to have to bury this transcript is that Trump brought up a few items that the media have been hoping the public would never find out about.

Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Well, that’s something the media haven’t mentioned before. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will be hearing about the funny business with Biden’s son, Hunter, for the first time with the release of this transcript.

Why did Vice President Biden order the Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor investigating the Ukrainian company paying his son millions of dollars? Are Democrats claiming that this company was clean as a whistle and it was an absolute OUTRAGE that it was being investigated?

Ukraine was looking into the company that conveniently placed Hunter Biden on its board long before Trump came on the scene. Something must have made the Ukrainian prosecutor want to investigate Biden’s company — and it sure wasn’t to curry favor with the Obama/Biden administration.

The second issue the media does not want anyone to think about is CrowdStrike.

What is CrowdStrike, you ask? That is the cybersecurity firm that is the sole source of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC’s emails — which launched the conspiracy theories that tied our country in knots for the past three years.

The Russian collusion story was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 to cover up the utter corruption revealed by the dump of Democratic National Committee emails on Wikileaks. As was her practice whenever a scandal threatened to engulf her, Hillary rushed out and told the press to investigate something else.

And “the great story” about the DNC email hack wasn’t about a “vast right-wing conspiracy” — as she claimed when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. No, this time, it was a vast Russian conspiracy!

At the time, the entire media laughed at Hillary’s Russian conspiracy nonsense — the New York Times, New York Newsday, the Los Angeles Times, and so on. But then Trump won the election, and suddenly the Russia conspiracy seemed totally believable. What else could explain how Americans could put this boob in the White House?

The subsequent three years of breathless Russia coverage was based entirely on the word of one cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, that the DNC’s emails had been hacked by Russia.

Recall that the DNC wouldn’t allow the FBI or any other U.S. government official anywhere near its computers. That’s precisely why so many cybersecurity experts doubted that it was the Russians: The FBI was never allowed to perform its own investigation.

CrowdStrike was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen apparently — because who isn’t?) and funded by the fanatically anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk Foundation.

Talk about interfering with our democracy! Alperovitch and Pinchuk sent one political party and nine-tenths of the American media off on a wild goose chase into Russian collusion that, after years of accusations, investigations and embarrassing conspiracy-mongering … turned up goose eggs.

The entire Russian insanity was launched by a couple of Ukrainians. I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.

This is why Trump said to President Zelensky: “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

(How’d you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)

Trump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it’s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son’s back. Maybe Biden’s son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It’s not Trump’s fault that Biden is now running for president.

I’ll give the Democrats this: They’ve gotten so good at trying to remove Trump from office that, instead of three years, their insane accusations blow up in their faces within a week."

The demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post.

Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden — even without a quid pro quo — was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.)

Thiessen observed (original links):

It got almost no attention, but in May [2018], CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Democrats’ letter is available online here. In it, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: “This reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal — to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community — about your government’s commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.”

The president released the transcript shortly after his message on Twitter, which revealed that Trump spoke to Zelensky about the investigation of meddling in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s possible corrupt behavior in the country.

Below is the relevant portion of the transcript

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me. President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I’m knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.

The president asked Zelensky to coordinate with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to discuss the investigations.

“Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy,” he said. “If you could speak to him that would be great.”

The president also pointed to a Breitbart News report that Democrats also reached out to Ukraine to ask officials to cooperate with an investigation."

Hirono on CNN’s “New Day” said there is sufficient “concrete evidence” to start an impeachment inquiry, adding it is different now that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is telling members of Congress the Ukraine report could bring about a new set of investigations.

“First, there needs to be an inquiry,” Hirono told host John Berman. “That’s why I’ve called for an impeachment inquiry or impeachment process. That’s different from impeachment in my view. First, you have to get the evidence, and then you decide whether or not you’re going to go ahead with impeachment proceedings after that.”

She continued, “I think there is more concrete evidence, and even if the president didn’t say, ‘Hey, by the way, leader of the Ukraine, you know, I’m holding back money so I’ll release it if you investigate Biden, my opponent, possible opponent.’ You know, you don’t have to have the president actually say that. The president knows that his conversations are monitored, but one should be able to connect the dots, and I think there is evidence.”

U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018, urging them to cooperate with investigators in the Russia investigation and the investigation of President Donald Trump.

“They shouldn’t have done that,” Trump said. “That should be an impeachable event … tremendous pressure on Ukraine.”

Trump noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement saying that the president put no pressure on him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption.

He again argued that he halted foreign aid to Ukraine to see if other countries would help Ukraine with defense aid, and condemned the Democrat’s impeachment process as the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.”

After releasing a transcript of the call, Trump said that the conversation was proven “friendly.”

“There was no pressure. The way you had that built up, that call, it was going to be the call from hell,” he said. “It turned out to be a nothing call.”

The call transcript confirmed that Trump asked Zelensky about a possible investigation into Biden and his son for their actions in Ukraine.

Trump accused the establishment media for fueling the ongoing controversy over his phone call after a whistleblower raised concerns about the content of the call based on second-hand information.

“So, part of the problem you have is you have the fake news,” he said. “You have a lot of corrupt reporting, there’s some very fine reporters and journalists, but you have a lot of corrupt reporters, a lot of corrupt journalists.”"

He accused Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of having ""literally threatened"" Zelensky during a recent trip to Ukraine, alleging that Murphy said ""that if he doesn't do things right they won't have Democratic support in Congress.""

Later in the press conference, Trump said: ""I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did. But the only difference is I didn't do it...There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with these senators.

JUST WATCHED Tapper: First, let's note, Trump said a lot of things that aren't true Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper: First, let's note, Trump said a lot of things that aren't true 01:28

We fact checked Trump's claims about Biden and Ukraine here . This time, let's start with the letter.

A request, not a threat

Facts First: The 2018 letter from Sens. Patrick Leahy, Dick Durbin and Bob Menendez did not include any threat at all, about US assistance to Ukraine or anything else; it did not even mention US assistance.

Rather, it expressed concern about a New York Times article that said Ukraine had -- with the aim of avoiding Trump's anger -- stopped cooperating with the Robert Mueller investigation and frozen investigations into the Ukraine-related activities of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman.

It urged Ukraine to ""reverse course"" if the Times story was accurate.

Manafort, a longtime lobbyist, had worked as an adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, receiving millions of dollars for his work . He was subsequently convicted of multiple financial crimes related to payments he received from Ukraine, which he laundered to avoid paying taxes.

It is difficult to conclusively fact check Trump's claim that the Democrats' letter ""implied"" that assistance to Ukraine was at stake; different people read between the lines differently. But the plain language of the senators' letter does not appear to even hint at withdrawing aid to Ukraine, and the senators say they were not doing so.

""The Senators' letter was written in response to a New York Times report that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General was considering not cooperating with the Mueller Probe out of concern that President Trump would cut off aid as punishment. The Senators' letter in no way calls for the conditioning of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine,"" the senators said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

The letter was written while Petro Poroshenko was president of Ukraine. It said the senators were ""disappointed"" that ""some in Kiev"" appeared to have cast aside principles of their shared relationship like ""respect for the rule of law and accountable democratic institutions"" in an attempt to ""avoid the ire of President Trump.""

""If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation,"" the letter said.

The letter concluded with three questions to Ukraine's prosecutor general. It asked whether his office had indeed taken steps to stop cooperating with Mueller, whether anyone acting for the Trump administration had asked Ukraine to do so, and whether the Mueller probe had been raised during previous bilateral meetings between the two countries.

Urging an investigation?

Trump was not the only prominent Republican to wrongly describe the letter. In a tweet earlier on Wednesday, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, ""In 2018, Democrat Senators wrote a letter to Ukraine, urging them to investigate @realDonaldTrump.""

On Thursday morning, Trump retweeted a tweet from his son Donald Trump Jr. that amplified another Twitter user's claim that the Democrats' letter had asked Ukraine to ""investigate Trump.""

Facts First: The letter did not call for any investigating of Trump. Again, the senators urged the prosecutor not to stop existing investigations and not to stop cooperating with Mueller because they were worried about Trump's reaction, and they asked if the Trump administration had encouraged Ukraine to stop cooperating.

The claim about Murphy

We don't know exactly what Murphy said to Zelensky during their meeting three weeks ago, which Murphy said was attended by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, so we can't call Trump's claim true or false.

""I told Zelensky that he should not take orders from Trump's campaign and that his credibility would be greatly compromised if he interfered in the 2020 election. That's common sense, and I stand by what I said. 100%,"" he said.

Murphy also said in a written statement that he had also told Zelensky ""that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign."""

""Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the President: This is not OK. That conversation is not OK.""

""I think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the (conversation's) transcript,"" the Ohio Republican said.

Turner's critical comments add to a small but growing list of remarks by Republicans who have expressed concern over a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressured him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The conversation with Zelensky has led to a House impeachment inquiry into the President's actions, with Democrats claiming Trump abused his office by asking Ukraine to investigate his political opponent. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

As acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House panel on Thursday, many congressional Republicans told CNN that they hadn't yet read the complaint, which was released to the public earlier in the day.

(CNN) ​When the euphoria from the announcement that the US House will pursue an impeachment inquiry of President Trump wears off for Democrats and others who oppose Trump's administration, and all the talking heads have spoken, remember this -- it's important: Trump didn't change the country; he revealed it.

The latest chapter in the most bizarre political saga in modern memory may very well lead to Trump's removal. Or it may not.

It may encourage Americans to follow the news more closely, it may prompt them to stay further away. It could derail Trump's re-election bid or provide his supporters with an energizing rallying cry. Certainly Trump's team is hoping for the latter, considering that Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Bradley Parscale, tweeted, ""Democrats have officially paved the way for a @realDonaldTrump landslide victory. The witch-hunt continues,"" which feels like a stretch considering Trump comfortably lost the popular vote and his Electoral College victory margin ranked 46th of 58 US elections

Regardless of Parscale's misplaced bravado, the real issue isn't what happens to Trump anyway. It's what happens to the nearly 63 million people who voted for him.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is correct: ""No one is above the law."" But for many who voted for Trump in the first place, this development isn't about the law, the Constitution or the sanctity of democracy. It is about winning. And if being willfully ignorant of Trump's alleged misdeeds helps Republicans win, they'll take it.

Trump also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me,"" Trump says, according to the document.

The release of the transcript showing Trump repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate a political rival comes a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry.

Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky.

At an afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo.""

The rough transcript, which a senior White House official said was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening, will likely amplify the Democratic impeachment effort.

""The fact is that the President of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign at the expense of our national security, as well as undermining the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said after the transcript was released Wednesday. ""That cannot stand. He will be held accountable. No one is above the law.""

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Wednesday that the President's message to the Ukrainian President was clear, despite some debate over whether there was quid pro quo.

""There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office. Even though many read this as a quid pro quo. I'm not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not. Ukraine understood what this President wanted,"" the California Democrat said.

The July 25 call, which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, a source familiar with the situation previously told CNN, a revelation that has only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy.

During the call, Trump suggested four times that Barr will call Zelensky and repeatedly mentions Giuliani, the Trump ally and former New York City mayor.

Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

On the call, Zelensky agreed to the President's request.

""Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate,"" the Ukrainian president said. He later added: ""He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.""

Wednesday, the Ukranian leader said he did not feel pressured.

""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky said in a joint appearance with Trump.

Trump said Wednesday evening that he's willing to release a transcript of another call with the Ukrainian president.

""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the one the public learned more about Wednesday through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released.""

He reiterated that it was a ""very innocent"" call.

'I would like you to do us a favor'

Prior to mentioning Biden, Trump criticized Mueller's testimony from the day prior and raised the possibility of looking into the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which has been retained by Democrats and Republicans in recent years.

After getting hacked in 2016, the Democratic National Committee hired CrowdStrike to investigate the attacks. CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government, which was later confirmed by Mueller's investigation.

Then, Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine is ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US, prompting Trump's reply, ""I would like you to do us a favor.""

""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it,"" Trump told Zelensky according to the transcript.

""There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,"" he added. ""Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.""

There is no evidence Ukraine has the server Trump is referring to.

Trump also told Zelensky the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine.

""A lot of European countries are the same way, so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,"" he said.

Zelensky agreed, and told Trump the US is a ""much bigger partner"" to Ukraine than other European countries regarding sanctions on Russia, adding that he planned to purchase more Javelin missiles from the United States.

Criminal referral

The Justice Department also said Wednesday that it received a criminal referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in late August to investigate whether the President's push for Ukraine to investigate Biden was a violation of campaign finance law.

DOJ declined to bring a case because it found that asking the Ukrainians to investigate Biden was not something of monetary value, and therefore did not run afoul of campaign finance laws.

The Justice Department's examination centered on the July call. Prosecutors interviewed White House officials involved in producing the transcript to establish it was a reliable record of the call. No other interviews were done. The FBI received a separate referral from the inspector general but deferred to the DOJ criminal division which was doing its analysis, according to a senior Justice Department official.

Barr was also not recused from handling the issue despite the fact that his name comes up in Trump's call with Zelensky.

In the ICIG's assessment of the whistleblower complaint, they noted that ""some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate."" The ICIG still determined that the complaint was credible.

Barr hasn't spoken with Trump on Biden

The Justice Department says Barr has not spoken with Trump, the Ukrainian government or Giuliani about the Biden issue.

""The attorney general was first notified of the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral. The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,"" Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement Wednesday.

""The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine -- on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine -- on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani,"" Kupec added.

Congress reacts

The immediate reaction to the transcript from congressional lawmakers was largely split down party lines.

Top Democrats have concluded it showed clear evidence of Trump pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage. Republicans immediately insisted -- as has Trump -- that there was no explicit quid pro quo in the call -- an argument that is likely to form the centerpiece of the anti-impeachment case.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that the transcript is ""pretty damning, in terms of the President trying to put pressure on a foreign government to interfere in our elections or to get dirt on his opponent,"" though he would not say if it contained evidence Trump committed an impeachable offense.

Pelosi however, asserted that the transcript only highlights the need for a formal impeachment inquiry.

""The transcript and the Justice Department's acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President's lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act,"" she said in a statement.

Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the document a ""smoking gun.

""If this is the version of events the president's team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy,"" Warren tweeted.

The Trump 2020 campaign was quick to unleash its own offensive, and several Republicans immediately came to the President's defense.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Democrats would be ""insane"" to impeach Trump over a telephone call.

Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley echoed that sentiment, underlining how the political terrain over the months-long impeachment fight to come is already being drawn.

""I've read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,"" Grassley said.

(CNN) The White House transcript of President Donald Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should cause Republicans to tremble. It reveals that the President did push Zelensky to investigate Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Before asking Zelensky to ""do us a favor"" by helping with this investigation, he reminded him that the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine.

This kind of stunning evidence of the President abusing his power is the reason that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally took the major step of throwing her full support behind the impeachment inquiry. The six committees currently investigating President Trump are now operating under one umbrella with the official mandate of determining whether to vote for articles of impeachment. Should they end up taking this vote, Trump would join a small list that includes only three other presidents who have faced impeachment since the establishment of the country (Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William J. Clinton).

The President has struck back in predictable fashion. ""A total Witch Hunt!"" and ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" were some of the first words to come in over the Twitter transom . A number of Republicans have already joined him. At the heart of the counterattack is the claim that impeachment is a radical action. The entire process, Republicans will likely continue to say, is being driven by a Democratic party motivated by its left-wing base. Trump will try to defeat Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats as President Clinton prevailed over Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in 1998

If Democrats want to retain the support of their moderate wing who have joined this cause and desire to stand any chance of winning over Republican support in the House or Senate, they will need to respond to these charges of harassment. Fortunately for Speaker Pelosi, in the case of Trump, supporters of impeachment have a series of cogent arguments to make to convince GOP members of Congress.

While much of the discussion has centered around the Democrats, the spotlight should be on the GOP. They are the party being tested. And there are four reasons why there is a clear conservative case for the impeachment of President Trump.

1. Restraining the power of presidents

Restraining presidential power should be a top priority for conservatives. Few recent presidents have exercised their power with the same level of reckless abandon as the current commander in chief. If Republicans mean what they say about championing limited government, then there really is no justification for the party's decisions since the time of Richard Nixon to continue granting power to the executive branch when their party was in power. Simply put, further empowering the President means growing the role of government. The fact that the President has so much authority, from the ability to send troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war to using executive measures to achieve policy goals like building a wall, does not square with their agenda.

Unlikely as it may seem, supporting impeachment is an unprecedented opportunity to reverse course on their hypocrisy and re-embody their own ideals. Trump has exposed, more than almost any of his recent predecessors, just how much a president can do if they are willing to ignore basic norms and if they are not scared about the potential response from Congress or the courts. Supporting the impeachment process, and possibly a decision to impeach and convict, could allow Republicans to go on record showing that they still do believe in small government.

2. Protecting national security

Protecting national security has also been a central goal of the conservative movement. During the 1980s, for instance, President Ronald Reagan railed against Democrats for being weak on defense as he pushed for higher defense spending and insisted on taking a tough stand with the Soviets. George W. Bush pushed for a proactive militaristic response to terrorist networks as well as states that he claimed threatened American interests. Yet President Trump has not done much to uphold this tradition. His coziness with Vladmir Putin has frustrated intelligence and military officials who understand that Russia has been conducting ongoing efforts to interfere in our electoral system.

The President has handled relations with North Korea in topsy-turvy fashion, doing little to produce an actual nuclear weapons agreement or halt North Korea's weapons production. His efforts to persuade Ukraine , possibly withholding military aid as an incentive to investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden, have inspired similar fears. All of this prompted seven moderate Democrats who are veterans of the military to publish their Washington Post piece endorsing the impeachment inquiry.

JUST WATCHED Pelosi on impeachment inquiry: No one is above the law Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi on impeachment inquiry: No one is above the law 02:43

3. Standing up for the rule of law

Republicans have also loved to imagine that they are the party of law and order. Ever since Richard Nixon's time in office, they have tried to assure voters that they are the party that can be best trusted to follow the rule of law and to give law enforcement institutions all the support they need. Under the Trump administration, they have so far been sitting passively as a President ran roughshod over all the institutions they have claimed to champion. Throughout his presidency, Trump has peddled mendacity and offered disinformation contradicting solid intelligence data that has been collected on matters like Russia. He has repeatedly acted with disregard for the law, he's been accused of flagrantly obstructing justice while under investigation by Mueller and refused to cooperate fully with congressional oversight.

The current scandal was triggered by the fact that the administration did not share the whistleblower complaint with Congress, as is required by law. The accumulation of evidence that the President does not abide by the rule of law is overwhelming. Republicans can only show Americans they still care about this crucial aspect of our democracy if they cooperate with this investigation.

4. Mike Pence

In addition to these three core conservative elements behind the impeachment investigation, Democrats looking to forge bipartisan accord can reiterate that if President Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be replaced by an extraordinarily conservative Republican -- Vice President Mike Pence -- who is arguably even more rightward than the President. So if this really is a left-wing effort to mount a coup, it is poorly conceived. Success would not change the balance of partisan power nor would it in any way moderate the agenda of the White House.

Based on the voluminous evidence that we already have of Trump's wrongdoing, there is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles. In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for."

James Biden, who has a history of murky financial dealings, allegedly promised a Florida-based dental company, Integrate Oral Care, that the Biden Cancer Initiative “would promote their business.” The promise came in November 2018 as James Biden and his business partners were weighing an investment in the company, according to Politico.

“James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients,” the outlet noted.

The revelation comes after Integrate filed a suit against James Biden and Platinum Global Partners in June, claiming they never followed through on a promise to investment $3 million into the company. The suit is similar to one filed in Tennessee against James Biden in which the former vice president’s brother is accused of defrauding a rural healthcare company.

Unlike the Tennessee suit, however, the Integrate suit marks the first mention of the Biden Cancer Initiative — a non-profit set up by the former vice president after leaving the White House. In June, the organization, which did not fund cancer research but rather convened major institutions to work on the issue, suspended its operations indefinitely after questions were raised about the influence its donors would have on Biden were he to be elected president in 2020.

James Biden is not the only member of the former vice president’s immediate family to draw scrutiny for his business dealings.

Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s youngest son, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. In particular, there are serious questions over how Hunter was able to secure a seat on the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest independent oil and gas company — Bursiam Holdings — in 2014. Hunter secured the position, which reportedly paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry.

Ethics watchdogs have highlighted the fact that a month prior to the appointment, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. At the same time, Burisma was attempting to court western leaders , even going to the extent of hiring a Washington, D.C. lobbyist with ties to then-Secretary of State John Kerry, after its assets had been frozen in the United Kingdom on suspicion of money laundering.

It was this tie and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption in 2016, that Trump believes should be probed in Ukraine."
387,"Daniel Dale and Marshall Cohen, CNN",,President Donald Trump used a false claim about former Vice President Joe Biden to explain to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky why Biden should be investigated.,2019-09-25,CNN,Fact check: Trump made false claim to Ukrainian president to justify his Biden request,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/fact-check-trump-made-false-claim-to-ukrainian-president-to-justify-his-biden-request/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump used a false claim about former Vice President Joe Biden to explain to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky why Biden should be investigated.

Trump also made a confusing apparent reference to a conspiracy theory about CrowdStrike, the American cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee.

The claim about Biden

According to a White House transcript released Wednesday , Trump said to Zelensky during a phone call in July:

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me.""

Facts First: Joe Biden did not brag that he stopped any prosecution. Rather, he bragged that he had successfully pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who was widely criticized for failing to bring corruption prosecutions.

Trump's suggestion was that Biden had boasted of stopping the ""prosecution"" of the business dealings of Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a company, Burisma Holdings, for which his son Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

But there was no actual prosecution of Zlochevsky or Burisma -- just an investigation that had not produced any prosecutions and that does not seem to have been pursued vigorously.

There is no evidence Joe Biden ever tried to thwart this investigation, much less that he boasted about doing so.

What Biden said

Joe Biden, the administration's point man on the Ukraine file, pressured Ukrainian leaders to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had faced international criticism for what was seen as an unwillingness to prosecute elite corruption.

Shokin, hired in 2015, was fired in 2016. Biden bragged about the saga at an event in January 2018 , recounting how he had threatened to withhold a billion-dollar US loan guarantee to Ukraine if Shokin was not removed.

At no point during Biden's story did he mention the investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma. Further, there is no sign that Biden did anything to impede the investigation -- which may not even have been active at the time.

Vitaliy Kasko, a former deputy prosecutor who resigned from Shokin's office in February 2016, alleging that the office was itself corrupt, told Bloomberg this year that the investigation was dormant by the time of Joe Biden's intervention. Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Washington Post for a July article that ""Shokin was not investigating.""

In a 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, blasted ""corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General's Office"" for working against anti-corruption efforts. One example Pyatt cited: the office's refusal to assist in a United Kingdom investigation into Zlochevsky

The claim about CrowdStrike

According to the document released by the White House, Trump also said to Zelensky: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people...The server, they say Ukraine has it."" (The ellipses are in the White House document.)

It's not entirely clear what Trump meant, but some inferences can be made based on his previous remarks.

CrowdStrike isn't Ukrainian, but Trump has said it is.

One of the company's senior executives previously had a lengthy career at the FBI . And one of its co-founders, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a prominent think tank in Washington. Alperovitch was born in the Soviet Union, in what is now Russia, then emigrated with his family to the US.

It isn't clear who Trump was referring to when he mentioned ""one of your wealthy people,"" but in a 2017 interview with the Associated Press , he said he has heard CrowdStrike ""is Ukrainian-based."" It was not then and it is not now.

""I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard,"" Trump added in that 2017 interview, though, again, it is not and was not.

It is possible Trump was alluding to a very vague conspiracy theory involving wealthy Ukrainian businessman Viktor Pinchuk , a financial supporter of the Atlantic Council, where, again, Alperovitch is a senior fellow.

There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Pinchuk.

CrowdStrike and the DNC

Trump did not specify to Zelensky what he meant by ""the server,"" but he has repeatedly complained about how the Democratic National Committee and the FBI handled a hack into DNC servers in 2016.The DNC hired CrowdStrike in 2016 to investigate the hack.

After conducting an investigation, CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government for the hack -- a finding later confirmed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Trump and his Republican allies have fomented conspiracy theories about the hack since 2016. Trump has publicly rejected overwhelming evidence that Russia was the country responsible. And he has repeatedly questioned why the DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the breach instead of handing its servers over to the FBI for direct examination.

There is no evidence to support the conspiracies about the DNC servers. But by withholding the servers from the FBI, Democrats created a talking point for Republicans, who have claimed that the DNC was hiding something.

Former FBI director James Comey, who led the early phases of the Russia investigation, testified in 2017 that it would have been better if the DNC gave the servers to the FBI, but that the FBI was able to get the forensic information it needed from CrowdStrike. Mueller later brought detailed criminal charges against Russian hackers for their involvement in the hacks.

CrowdStrike said in a statement on Wednesday: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community."""

Wednesday that ""it's awful hard to avoid the conclusion"" President Donald Trump committed ""an impeachable offense"" by pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden.

It was the furthest Biden has gone on the subject of Trump's impeachment -- which most of the other leading 2020 Democratic presidential contenders have called for.

Asked how the matter ranks on the ""outlandish scale"" of American politics, Biden said: ""18 out of 10.""

Biden's comments came the day the White House released a transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky.

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

Mitt Romney had been a lone Republican voice expressing concern about President Donald Trump's July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked Ukraine's President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.

Romney came to Washington promising to speak out against the President when the time called for it. Days ago, he became the first prominent elected Republican to convey his dismay about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, one of Trump's political rivals for the White House, and Biden's son at a time when Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.

There were some signs on Wednesday evening that other Republican voices, including one GOP senator who had read the whisteblower complaint in a secure setting, that Romney may no longer be alone in his concerns.

Romney stood his ground on Wednesday after reading the call summary of the discussion between Trump and Zelensky.

""My reaction was the same as (the one) I had a few days ago, which is -- this remains deeply troubling,"" Romney said during an interview at The Atlantic Festival on Wednesday. ""We'll see where it leads, but the first reaction is troubling.""

Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican up for election in 2020, echoed those thoughts after reading the complaint on Wednesday evening.

""This (is) going to take a long time but there's obviously some very troubling things here. But I think the partisan tribalism that's always insta-certain is a terrible idea. There are real troubling things here. Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach' before they knew anything about the actual substance.""

Other senators had criticisms for the President as well. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, called Trump's conversation with Zelensky ""inappropriate"" in a statement earlier in the day.

GOP Ohio Sen. Rob Portman also told CNN's Manu Raju that nothing in the transcript surprised him. ""It was exactly what I expected.""

But when pressed about whether Trump should have asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden, Portman added: ""It didn't surprise me, because he said he did. I would rather have seen that—yes—he should not have.""

It was on Sunday that Romney tweeted that ""if the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out."" That made him the first Republican to forcefully express concern with Trump's actions.

The Trump White House clearly believed Wednesday that releasing details of the July 25 conversation -- as well as sending the related whistleblower complaint to Congress -- would clear up the matter for their opponents and doubters, and perhaps ease some of the pressure for impeachment proceedings in the US House.

But as lawmakers parsed the sentences of the call summary on Wednesday, the opposite seemed true. Still, most Republicans swiftly fell in line with the administration's argument that the call summary showed there was no direct quid pro quo.

Romney, on the other hand, continued to say he wanted to see all the information, including the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint that the White House is sending over to Congress.

Romney sidestepped a question at The Atlantic Festival about whether he saw the implication of a quid pro quo in the call summary.

The Utah senator explained he ""wasn't as focused"" on the potential quid pro quo aspect of the call as others, but added: ""If the President of the United States asks or presses the leader of a foreign country to carry out an investigation of a political nature that's troubling, and I feel that.""

To underscore his point, the Utah senator pointed to the extraordinary power of the presidency, as well as the House and the Senate.

""I think it's very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that's most amenable to maintaining their power and doing things to preserve their power,"" Romney said when asked by the moderator why he was virtually alone among GOP officials in highlighting the seriousness of the potential offense by the President.

Perhaps as a way of explaining Trump's motivation for talking to Zelensky about Biden and his son -- and his party's inclination to defend the President, Romney noted that both parties feel deeply that if the opposing party were in charge ""terrible things would happen for the country ... and it's critical for them to hold on to their leadership.""

""I think it's just in human nature to see things in a way that is consistent with your own world view and your sense of what's necessary for the preservation of your position of power,"" Romney said. ""I don't know why I'm not afflicted to the same degree as perhaps others are in that regard. Maybe it's because I'm old and have done other things.""

The Utahn declined to wade into the impeachment debate, stating that the House was considering the President's actions and that he wasn't going to ""give advice to Speaker Pelosi.""

When Romney was elected to the Senate from the deep red state of Utah, he promised that he would stand up to Trump if he believed he was wrong. That was appreciated by his constituents who -- though overwhelmingly Republican -- generally give lower marks to Trump than voters in other red states.

""He's got a pretty strong moral compass,"" said Lanhee Chen, who advised Romney on foreign policy during his 2012 run for the White House.

""He was going to speak his mind without regard to party or politics, and this is very much in line with that,"" said Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and lecturer in the public policy program at Stanford University. ""He has great concern about what he sees as potential misuse or malfeasance in office."""

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

That man? Attorney General William Barr.

On two more occasions during that conversation, Trump said he would have Barr (in addition to Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) get in touch with Zelensky to look into the Biden thing.

Which is problematic, given that Trump is seemingly putting America's attorney general in charge of coordinating an investigation -- with a foreign power! -- into a possible 2020 rival. Knowing what that looks like, the Justice Department released a statement in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's transcript release, denying that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Wednesday addressed reporters after viewing a federal employee’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s telephone conversation with the leader of Ukraine, claiming it “exposed serious wrongdoing.”

House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff speaks after reviewing the whistleblower complaint https://t.co/aYIcGo5zvO pic.twitter.com/Eh0qU5Et4b — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 25, 2019

In his remarks, Schiff described the complaint as “well-written” and praised the still-anonymous individual who authored the complaint as brave.

“What this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing, and I think it a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it was, because it was an urgent matter, it is an urgent matter,” he said.

The complaint, received by acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire a number of weeks ago, alleges that President Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden, back in July.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Although Schiff stands behind the so-called “whistleblower’s” crediblity, the Department of Justice on Wednesday confirmed that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found the individual who made the complaint has a “political bias” that was “in favor of a rival political candidate.”

According to a memo released by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, the inspector general stated that it received a complaint of “urgent concern,” though the OLC determined the matter “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” or require that the national intelligence director send the complaint to House and Senate intelligence committees.

During a joint press conference at the United Nations, both President Trump and Zelensky confirmed the conversation occurred and affirmed no pressure was applied to probe the Biden family. “I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.

Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the call, which shows the pair discussed U.S. military aid to Ukraine and Hunter Biden — and there was no quid pro quo discussed at any point of the conversation.

Nonetheless, the call prompted a group of House Democrats to come out in favor of impeachment and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to endorse a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.

Asked for his thoughts on the move by Pelosi, President Trump suggested the California Democrat has lost control of her caucus.

“[Speaker Pelosi’s] been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party. You take a look at what’s happening in the media today. The whole party is taken over by the left and thank you very much — my poll numbers have gone up,” he said.

Of the impeachment probe, House Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News that Democrats “lost their minds” and predicted it will “backfire on them” in the 2020 election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” said McCarthy. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”"

Several personalities and guests on Fox News, the cable network that employs a number of hosts and personalities who have a close relationship with the Trump White House, repeatedly said the call log didn't show an explicit promise of military aide to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Biden and his son, or a ""quid pro quo.""

Effectively, the personalities and guests were suggesting the transcript either cleared Trump of wrongdoing, or didn't provide enough evidence for Democrats to move forward with impeachment.

The explosive charge is among the reasoning cited in Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee Michael Atkinson's report which said the complaint by a whistleblower , which detailed the July 25 call and other moves by the Trump administration regarding Ukraine, amounts to an ""urgent concern"" and ""appears credible"" -- two statutory requirements considered as whistleblower allegations progress through review.

""In the ICIG's judgment, alleged conduct by a senior US public official to seek foreign assistance to interfere in or influence a Federal election... would also potentially expose such a US public official (or others acting in concert with the US public official) to serious national security and counterintelligence risks with respect to foreign intelligence services aware of such alleged conduct,"" Atkinson wrote.

Despite the inspector general's transmitting of the whistleblower's complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire along with his finding of ""urgent concern"" in late August, the complaint was not sent to Congress until this week.

In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday, Maguire said that he consulted with the White House counsel's office and later the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel after receiving the complaint for guidance on how to handle it.

Let's go through it, step by step.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

1. Trump, after congratulating Zelensky on his win, very quickly establishes that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

2. He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US.

""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr.

""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""

5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion

""I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.""

So, in sum: The President of the United States tells a foreign leader that we do a lot for his country and his country hasn't done enough for us. Then he says that it would be super nice if Ukraine looked into allegations -- debunked by all independent fact checkers and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, it's worth noting -- that his main rival in the 2020 race did some unethical things in the country. Because, he asserts, it sounds ""horrible"" to him. And then reiterates -- several times! -- that the Ukrainian president needs to talk to his personal lawyer and his administration's attorney general about all of this.

Are you kidding me? And reminder, this isn't even really a transcript of their call. As the document notes: ""The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.""

Even if Trump hadn't openly asked Zelensky to look into Biden and instead only suggested that he had heard rumors of corruption regarding the Bidens and Ukraine, this call would be problematic. Because the United States is a global superpower which was, at that moment, withholding loan money from Ukraine -- a fact that the newly elected president of said country would be intimately aware of. That Trump just came out and asked for Zelensky to investigate the Bidens -- after reminding him several times of how much the US did for Ukraine!!!! -- is something very close to the textbook definition of a quid pro quo.

Take it out of the context of politics. Let's say you are a small business owner who has seen an uptick in business thanks to a series of referrals coming to you via a much larger company. And the CEO of that much larger company calls you and says something like ""We are doing a lot of good for your bottom line, right? More than you are doing for us. So, hey, our biggest competitor is apparently doing some pretty nasty things with their workers. You should really look into that.""

Now the larger company CEO didn't come out and say, ""Hey, do this muckraking of our main competitor or else your pipeline gets cut off by us,"" right? But unless your brain stem has somehow disconnected from your brain, you know exactly what is being asked here. Do this, or else.

It's hard to imagine why Trump, knowing what he said, would have spent the past 48 hours defending the call as ""perfect"" and totally above board. The actual transcript makes that pre-spin laughable.

""It ended up being a nothing call,"" Trump said in the wake of the release of the transcript on Wednesday morning.

But what is documented, very clearly, in this kind-of, sort-of transcript is this: The American President pressuring a foreign leader to look into the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. And doing it by reminding the Ukrainian President of all the US has done for his country.

The transcript is truly stunning stuff -- even from a President who has moved the goalposts on ""stunning"" a long time ago. If Trump thought releasing this transcript would somehow make Democrats look like fools for beginning an impeachment inquiry against him, he was wrong. Very, very wrong."

(CNN) The White House released a rough transcript Wednesday of a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, indicating that the President pressured a foreign leader to gather dirt on a political opponent.

Frank Bowman III

As a result, we now have facts quite distinct from any that have come out about this President before -- and the strongest, or at least most easily explainable, case for impeachment to date.

The allegations at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election concerned Trump's conduct while he was a candidate for office. There is good authority from the founding era that an effort to corrupt the electoral process ahead of an election might be impeachable. For example, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, both George Mason and Gouverneur Morris observed that a president who ""procured his appointment"" by corrupting the electors must be impeachable.

But since impeachment is at its core about a president's misuse of office or suitability to hold it, pre-inauguration conduct at least raises a tricky question. Whatever happened with the Russians during the 2016 election, Trump wasn't then in a position to use the organs of the American state to encourage foreign interference.

(CNN) The Trump-Ukraine story might seem complicated and there is much that we still have to learn, but the implications are clear: President Donald Trump apparently betrayed his country, and now, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced, his actions have triggered a formal impeachment inquiry.

His administration refused to share with Congress an urgent whistleblower complaint by an intelligence agent (although sources familiar with the matter say it may be released Wednesday), so we don't yet know the full details.

Still, media investigations have revealed the main outlines of the story: In July, Trump withheld military aid while pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to look into discredited allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's leading challenger in the 2020 election. Trump has acknowledged that he spoke with Zelensky about corruption and about Biden.

Trump would have us believe that this is all perfectly normal, and that his withholding of the military aid had nothing to do with his desire for an investigation of Biden. (On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he would release the ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky"" Wednesday.)

But none of this is normal. In fact, if Trump was trying to make a deal with the President of Ukraine, it was a crass move that put his personal political interests above those of the country he swore to serve.

Trump's actions toward Ukraine are likely a violation of anti-corruption laws , on top of his apparent violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. More importantly, Trump's behavior constitutes a violation of his oath of office, of his vow to ""protect and defend"" his nation, of the trust of the American people and of the most fundamental duties he accepted when he became President of the United States.

The apparent extortion of Ukraine is far worse than his solicitation and acceptance of Russian help to win in 2016. We'll see what the transcript of the call reveals, but it's worth noting that CNN reports the call is only part of the whistleblower complaint. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says that the whistleblower wants to testify before the committee.

When candidate Trump asked the Kremlin to help him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- saying , ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"" -- it was a despicable move to solicit assistance from a hostile power to influence an American election. But at the time Trump was a private citizen, without access to the vast power and resources of the executive branch.

This time, the President has engaged in what looks very much like extortion: demanding help smearing Biden in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid, and pressuring a desperate country to interfere in the 2020 US elections to help Trump tarnish the Democratic frontrunner.

On Tuesday, Trump again insisted he'd done nothing wrong and offered a new explanation for why he had withheld military aid, claiming that he'd done so because ""Europe and other nations"" were not contributing to helping Ukraine. That claim is false , and wouldn't justify the administration in pressuring Ukraine to investigate an opponent, or refusing to comply with a whistleblower law.

To all appearances, Trump has put pressure on Ukraine by hijacking $250 million dollars of US taxpayers' money that Congress had voted to give Ukraine so it could strengthen its defenses against its aggressive neighbor, Russia -- the country that helped Trump win the presidency in 2016.

The White House and Congress clashed bitterly over Trump's refusal to release these approved funds. After all, Congress made a decision based on what it believed was in the best interest of US national security . Trump did release the money -- after the whistleblower complaint was filed and was declared an "" urgent concern "" by the nonpartisan inspector general.

When Trump told President Zelensky last July to investigate Joe Biden and his son -- Trump made the demand about eight times in one conversation, according to the Wall Street Journal -- he was, at minimum, implicitly threatening that Ukraine's relationship with the United States, including military aid, was at stake. Whether or not he phrased it in such crass terms is only marginally important.

In pressuring Ukraine like this, Trump is leaving the country with a crushingly difficult choice. At the moment, the country is doing battle with Russian-backed, Russian-armed rebels , just five years after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea, and Russia continues actively assaulting Ukrainian sovereignty.

On the call with Zelensky, Trump insisted that Ukraine deal with his attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. According to Ukraine's summary of the call , Trump expressed optimism that the new Ukrainian government would forcefully pursue ""corruption cases"" which inhibited the interaction between the two countries. In the White House description of the call, which does not appear on the White House website, Trump congratulated President Zelensky on the latter's election and ""discussed ways to strengthen cooperation.""

There was no mention of investigations in the White House description of the July call.

A crucial, disturbing aspect of this scandal is that it breathes life into Trump's unsubstantiated accusations against Biden. Trump loyalists are telling Fox News viewers that there's a real scandal here, even though Ukrainian prosecutors insist the former Vice President did nothing wrong.

In addition to breaking faith with US voters and undermining the US national interest, the apparent extortion attempt may well qualify as criminal conduct under the Hobbs Act , a statute that bans public officials from demanding something of value in exchange for carrying out the duties of their office.

Trump, to all accounts, demanded something of value from the Ukrainian President: namely, help tarnishing his political rival. And he did not carry out the duty of disbursing legally mandated aid until September 11, weeks after the whistleblower had filed his complaint.

Along with Pelosi, another central figure who has been reluctant to call for impeachment appears to be changing his mind.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that he is not yet sure whether the Ukraine call was the subject of the whistleblower complaint, but that if a sitting president's telephone call with a foreign leader ""involve(d) potential corruption or criminality,"" or was used for ""political advantage against our nation's interest,"" then that would be the gravest violation yet of this presidency -- or perhaps of ""any presidency.""

If that is indeed what happened, and the signs strongly suggest it is, then Trump's behavior makes Watergate look like petty pickpocketing.

Trump likely betrayed his country, and he did it on the world stage, using taxpayers' money and toying with American security. What could be worse?"

That defense goes like this: Donald Trump never said to Zelensky, ""I won't do X unless you give me Y."" He never said the phrase ""quid pro quo."" Therefore, nothing to see here!

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Asked by the Boston Globe's Jess Bidgood what he would consider a quid pro quo from Trump to Zelensky, Graham replied

""'Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain't gonna give you any money,' [He'd] be really, like, thuggish about it.""

Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lawyers, made a very similar argument in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night . ""I think it's important to understand what we don't have, and what we don't have is a quid pro quo,'"" said Sekulow. ""In other words, 'I will do this, you do this.' That is absent.""

So, that's the bar? Really?

Take the logic of Graham and Sekulow out of this context and put it in an entirely different one. If someone comes up to you on the street, points a gun at you and says, ""Give me all your money!"" then, under Graham's conceit, you aren't being robbed. In order for it to be an actual robbery, the man pointing the gun has to say: ""Give me all your money. This is a robbery.""

Makes zero sense, right? You know what's happening even if the guy doesn't declare that he is using the threat of possible violence to separate you from your money. Why? Because, well, you just know. The human brain is able to look at a series of related inputs -- gun, demand for money, agitation -- and connect the dots: I am being robbed.

Now, circle back to Trump's conversation with Zelensky. To revisit that conversation

1. Trump, after congratulating Zelensky on his win, very quickly establishes that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.

""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

2. He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US.

""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr.

""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""

5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion.

""I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.""

Soooooooooo, yeah.

Graham and Sekulow are technically correct that Trump didn't directly tell Zelensky that if he wanted what the US had to offer ( like hundreds of millions of military aid ) that he had better look into the Bidens. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, by the way).

But come on, man! Put yourself in Zelensky's shoes for a minute and ask whether it is at all possible that the message you would have received from that call was something along the lines of ""We do a lot for you. If you want us to keep doing it, you need to do this one thing for me.""

Plus, there's this: Impeachment -- which the House embarked on formally this week with the beginnings of an inquiry -- is a political process, not a legal one. Meaning that even if you buy Graham's no-quid-pro-quo argument, which you shouldn't, there is no requirement for proof that Trump said the words in order to impeach him."

The comments, first reported by The New York Times, were made to an audience of career foreign service officers who work at the United Nations, two sources who were in the room and one person who knew someone in the room said. One source said the remarks were ""shocking"" and ""eerie.""

Other top US government officials were in the room as well, including the new US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft.

Not everyone in the room opposed Trump's comments. US Mission to the United Nations employees could invite their friends or family to the event and most of the people who accepted such an invite were Trump supporters who were not startled by Trump's threatening tone, another source said.

Earlier Thursday, a stunning whistleblower complaint alleged Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire also testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the whistleblower complaint.

Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a potential 2020 political rival , Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call, according to a transcript of the conversation released by the White House earlier Wednesday.

On the call, Zelensky agreed to the President's request, promising that the next prosecutor general ""will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.""

""Some media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not impeachment,"" Comey said in a Twitter post.

When asked in an interview with CNN affiliate KCRA last week if he thought Trump should be impeached, Comey said Congress should figure out whether alleged actions mentioned in the Mueller report would ""trigger impeachment,"" but as a citizen he hoped Trump would not be impeached.

""Because I think the American people would be let off the hook if Donald Trump were impeached and removed from office, and a lot of his supporters would think some kind of coup had taken place,"" Comey said in the KCRA interview. ""We need to take responsibility for this and vote next November and show that we have a certain set of values and we insist that our leaders reflect those values. So we need an inflection point.

Trump is struggling to respond to revelations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. And judging from his babbling public performance before reporters at the UN General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, he does not know how to cope.

As usual, the President talked about a ""witch hunt"" and ""fake news"" and popularity polls as he spoke in the hoarse voice that seems to come over him in moments of stress. Then he damaged the case for his own defense, saying that if then-Vice President Joe Biden had sought a favor from Ukraine in 2015, it would have constituted an ""impeachable event.""

There's no proof that Biden sought favors from Ukraine. In fact the idea that he did is refuted in original reports on the matter. But a rough White House transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows that the President did exactly what he'd suggested Biden had done.

""I would like you to do us a favor,"" Trump said to Zelensky, according to the White House transcript of the call. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son. That Biden stopped the prosecutions and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""

If there's ""a lot of talk"" about Biden's son, it has been generated mainly by the President, his supporters and his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump told Zelensky that both Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani would be calling the Ukrainian President.

As Biden has long occupied the front-runner position in the Democratic primary, Trump has cause to fear him -- and to try to undermine him. But urging Ukraine to investigate Biden's son constitutes an abuse of the public trust.

Why would Trump use a phone call with a foreign leader to ask for a blatantly personal and political favor? I would suggest that Trump expects the government to function like his personal business -- and as a result he can't imagine that anything he might desire would be out of bounds for a president.

Throughout his life, Trump has operated under special conditions that allowed him to get away with almost anything. The classic example came when his extremely wealthy father bailed out his casino by purchasing $3.5 million worth of chips at a blackjack table and then left the casino without gambling. This gambit broke state regulations, but the resulting fine -- $30,000 -- was paltry, and the deposit provided much-needed cashflow.

Family wealth bailed Trump out of other difficulties and made it possible for him to take risks that others would have avoided. Bankruptcy followed bankruptcy , but because Trump's family money was protected by corporate structures, he maintained his high-profile lifestyle and kept on promoting himself as a super-successful businessman. He spread lies about the prominent women who had allegedly pursued him as a romantic partner, and he offered wildly varying claims about his personal wealth. Trump has even said that his net worth depends on how he feels at a given moment.

The truth about Trump remained elusive because so much of what he claimed could not be verified. His privately held businesses were not required to produce accurate public financial reports, and they never did. Meanwhile, how do you determine whether, as Trump claimed , he had once been one of the best young baseball players in New York?

As his biographer, I put time into checking Trump's claims and discovered that many, like the one about his baseball prowess, were false. These lies didn't threaten the whole country when he was just the clown prince of New York real estate and a reality TV show host boasting, falsely, about his ratings.

But now that Trump is President, all the bluster that may have seemed amusing and harmless to those who stayed outside Trump's orbit has plunged the nation into a constitutional crisis.

What we've seen in just this one Trump scandal -- and there are many more -- suggests that the President is incapable of fulfilling his duties and may even be driven by self-destructive impulses.

As Trump acknowledged last week, a president's calls with foreign leaders are overheard by other US officials, who take notes. Given this knowledge, Trump's attempt to enlist Zelensky in his harebrained scheme was not just an abuse of public trust; it also demonstrates Trump's true beliefs about human nature. Who could be surprised that a national security official filed a whistleblower complaint about that phone call with Zelensky? Only a person who assumes that no one else ever acts out of a sense of ethical and moral duty.

What Trump seems to have ignored is that the American President operates in a system designed to check abuses -- and that the government he heads might be filled with people of conscience. As this scandal unfolds, the administration will come to learn the meaning of accountability. For Trump personally, it will be the first time."

""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No.""

The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to.

Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a whistleblower complaint that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.

Sitting in the same building where he launched his long shot presidential campaign four years ago, Trump said he couldn't believe it, he later told people.

He had felt confident after phoning Pelosi earlier that morning. The drive for impeachment in her caucus had ramped up amid reports he pushed the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden , and Trump was hoping to head off a clash. He figured he could de-escalate tensions by speaking with her directly.

It was after that call that Trump made the decision to release an ""unredacted"" version of the transcript of his July call -- against the advice of aides such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned him it would set a risky precedent. Trump wanted to undercut the argument from Democrats that he acted inappropriately, he said, and felt he had nothing to hide.

But when the announcement he would release the transcript did little to quell the growing calls for his impeachment, Trump was in disbelief.

Democrats immediately argued that it wouldn't be enough. They also wanted to see the whistleblower's complaint , which had been found urgent and credible by the inspector general for the intelligence community and was mandated by law to be handed over to the intelligence committees. Administration officials began working out a plan to declassify and redact the complaint so it could be turned over too, all in the hope of easing escalated tensions with lawmakers.

Sitting in a Manhattan hotel meeting room, the men eagerly sought to deflect questions of wrongdoing after a White House transcript released earlier in the day showed Trump pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The call has formed the basis for Democrats' impeachment probe, and has thrown Trump's presidency into turmoil. But as camera shutters whirred, Trump and Zelensky insisted nothing was untoward.

""There was no pressure,"" Trump insisted, denying allegations he was using his position of power to prod Ukraine into investigating a political rival.

""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky chimed in, denying he felt coerced by Trump to launch a probe. Instead, he suggested he was an unwilling participant in an American political firestorm.

""I'm sorry but I don't want to be involved (in) democratic open elections of USA,"" he said after consulting with a translator.

It may be too late for that. The controversy over Trump's dealings with Zelensky have massed into a political and diplomatic watershed, with Ukraine squarely in the center.

Trump remained defiant during a rambling Wednesday afternoon news conference that he ""didn't threaten anybody.""

""No push, no pressure, no nothing,"" Trump said. ""It's all a hoax, folks.""

Trump added, ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with the senators.""

He said he's told House Republicans he wants ""full transparency on the so-called whistleblower information,"" but continued to peddle conspiracy theories about Biden and his son. He also challenged the credibility of the whistleblower's claims.

Trump claimed the individual -- who has not been identified -- ""didn't have any first-class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand.""

The President told reporters he's willing to release a transcript of another, earlier call with Zelensky, as well as any calls between Ukraine and Vice President Mike Pence.

""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the July 25 conversation the public learned more about today through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released.""

The mid-afternoon meeting between Trump and Zelensky was arranged well before the whistleblower controversy exploded into public view, according to people familiar with the plans. Aides initially did not view it as a major highlight of Trump's agenda at this week's United Nations meetings, which they expected would focus heavily on Iran and not on the questions of abuse of power.

When news emerged that an intelligence whistleblower had filed a complaint related to Trump and Ukraine -- and later that it was related to Trump's July phone call with Zelensky -- White House officials began to view the meeting as an important venue for Trump to counter Democratic accusations of wrongdoing.

Trump began by making light of the matter, telling reporters that Zelensky ""made me more famous and I've made him more famous.""

And later his attention seemed to drift, recalling his onetime ownership of the Miss Universe pageant, won once by a Ukrainian contestant.

But the mood turned grave as Zelensky -- himself a former television personality whose entry into politics was as unlikely as Trump's -- raised Russia's annexation of Crimea.

""If you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration. Not during the Trump administration,"" Trump insisted, ascribing the invasion to his predecessor Barack Obama.

Asked whether he wants Zelensky to do more to investigate Biden, Trump said, ""No, I want him to do whatever he can.""

The evening before the meeting, Trump and Zelensky greeted each other at a diplomatic reception hosted by the American President for fellow leaders visiting New York for the annual United Nations meetings.

A photo posted by Zelensky on Twitter showed the two men with their spouses smiling broadly, without a hint of the controversy that now overhangs their relationship.

There have been conversations between US and Ukrainian officials this week about the matter, including over whether to release the log of the July phone call.

One official said there had not been extensive conversations between US and Ukrainian officials about what each leader would say during the open-press part of Wednesday's meeting, though they could not rule out more informal discussions, namely between Trump and Zelensky during the diplomatic reception or between Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his Ukrainian interlocutors.

Speaking during the meeting, Trump praised Giuliani, his private attorney, for pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, saying he was demonstrating admirable verve.

""Rudy Giuliani is a great lawyer, he was a great mayor, he's highly respected. I've watched the passion he's had on television over the last few days. Incredible what he's done,"" Trump said.

The sit-down between Trump and Zelensky on Wednesday was not originally meant to be their first meeting. Trump had agreed to meet Zelensky earlier this month in Poland, where he was planning to commemorate the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.

When a hurricane forced him to cancel his plans, Mike Pence went in his place and met with Zelensky in Warsaw . Afterward, Pence was asked whether the Biden matter arose in the talks. He said no, but did turn quickly to the issue of corruption in Ukraine.

Trump and Zelensky have spoken by phone twice: once immediately following Ukrainian elections in April, and again in July. The latter conversation has become the focal point for Democrats after an intelligence whistleblower raised concerns about Ukraine and Russia.

In the months following Zelensky's election, Trump showed little interest in meeting him, believing Ukraine to be an intractably corrupt country. He ascribed Russia's annexation of part of the country to his predecessor, who he repeatedly blamed for ""losing"" Crimea.

But as Giuliani began raising the issue of Biden and his son, Trump's interest was piqued. He was also convinced by top national security aides, including then-national security adviser John Bolton, that engaging the new leader would be valuable in countering Russia.

Bolton was also among those aides pushing Trump to approve an aid package worth millions of dollars to Ukraine after it was put on hold. That package -- and whether it was used as a bargaining chip in Trump's attempts to push an investigation into the Bidens -- has become a lynchpin in the impeachment inquiry."

(CNN) To understand the true meaning of what President Donald Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in their phone conversation in July, it is important to remember that the President speaks in code.

His longtime former lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress last February that Mr. Trump had never explicitly asked him to lie. ""He doesn't give you questions, he doesn't give you orders,"" Cohen said. ""He speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I've been around him for a decade...""

The account of the half-hour conversation that the White House released on Wednesday suggests that the Ukrainian President understood the code as well. American politicians who raise enormous sums for their campaigns without explicitly promising donors an illegal ""quid pro quo,"" are also fluent in the unspoken language of their trade.

If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is serious about pursuing an impeachment case against Trump, she will have to employ expert witnesses who can translate Trump's code into plain English. She will have no problem finding them on Capitol Hill.

Prosecutors do this all the time to help jurors understand what's really going on in wiretapped conversations between seasoned and wary gangsters. Any fan of ""The Sopranos"" would know that someone who has been ""clipped, whacked , erased, iced or hit,"" has been murdered.

If Pelosi hopes to prove Trump did anything impeachable on the call, a careful deconstruction of his words will be required, beginning with the transcript memo released by the White House. The President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quite helpfully provided a definition of the crime of bribery in two fiery encounters on cable news with CNN's Chris Cuomo and Fox's Laura Ingraham earlier this week. ""The crime of bribery is if I offer something of value to someone in return for their official action,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo.

He expanded on this for Fox's Laura Ingraham: ""The crime of bribery is defined in the Ukraine, as well as all of the world, as the following: You cannot offer something of value in exchange for official action.""

Unfortunately for Giuliani, this appears to be exactly what the President did.

The White House's ""memorandum"" begins innocently enough, with Trump congratulating the Ukrainian President on his recent electoral victory. Zelensky then fawns over Trump. He notes that he copied Trump campaign themes such as ""draining the swamp"" and compliments Trump as ""... a great teacher for us...""

Trump then reminds Zelensky that: ""Well it's very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

Trump then trash-talks German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying that ""...she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything.""

Next, he bashes other European countries in general (""they should be helping you more than they are""), reminding Zelensky once more ""but the United States has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal because things are happening that are not good, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

He follows with the barely coded language: ""we've supported you, unlike Germany and the Europeans."" And then there is the strange language about reciprocity, about the fact that ""things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

Zelensky now sounds worried. He may not be a student of Trump's political road show rallies and is probably having trouble following Trump's meandering stream of consciousness. Given what Trump has just said in the conversation, Zelensky could well be thinking: What is he talking about? What have we not been cooperative (reciprocal) about? Is Trump considering a permanent cut-off of American aid and support?

A nervous Zelensky replies, reaffirming Ukrainian support and cooperation with the US, including support for US sanctions against Russia and even a Ukrainian decision to buy ""more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.""

Sensing weakness, Trump now follows with the ""ask."" He opens rather explicitly: ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.""

He then makes a glancing reference to ""CrowdStrike,"" a company involved in the investigation of the hack of the DNC servers in 2016. And he follows with a request that Zelensky and Ukraine should cooperate with Rudolph Giuliani and the US attorney general, who will be calling him about getting ""to the bottom of"" whether former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's political rival, interfered in Ukrainian affairs to compel the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating a company that employed Biden's son, Hunter.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,"" Trump says, ""that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great."" (This Biden allegation has been debunked by independent fact checkers and to date there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) Nonetheless, the perpetuation of such a charge, even if false, could seriously damage Biden in a close Democratic primary race.

Trump says ""Biden has been bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""

All of this certainly looks like it fits Giuliani's own definition of bribery. President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The ""stick"" or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.

This kind of case is difficult, but provable, with a careful and fair congressional investigation developing corroborative evidence."

""If you're not walking the line, then you're out. That's just not right. That's not the party that my husband and I belonged to.""

John McCain, whose career in Washington spanned decades, cultivated a reputation for occasionally opposing Republicans. In the last years of his life, he was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, particularly over foreign policy, and Trump occasionally criticized the late Arizona senator, even after his passing.

According to the Post, a whistleblower complaint stemming from Trump's July phone conversation with the Ukrainian President that led to the impeachment inquiry ""includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations."" Giuliani's involvement in the US' relationship with the country has upset some officials in the administration, the paper said.

The vote was 421 to 0 with two lawmakers voting present.

House Democrats announced plans to vote on the resolution Tuesday -- the same day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry -- in the wake of outrage over reports that the President pressured a foreign leader in an effort to target a political rival. It was not clear until late in the day on Wednesday when the complaint would be transmitted to the Hill, if at all.

The resolution, from House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, calls for the complaint to be turned over to the congressional intelligence committees.

The vote took place just hours after the White House released a transcript showing that President Donald Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. CNN has previously reported that the call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The whistleblower complaint about Trump's communications with Ukraine was hand delivered Wednesday afternoon to Capitol Hill for lawmakers to review.

Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he has started to read the document, but declined to give his initial thoughts.

Members of the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee are also reviewing the documents.

It's not just Democrats who have vowed to find out the details of the whistleblower complaint.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday ""we're going to find out what happened"" with respect to the complaint and said that he expects the Senate Intelligence Committee will conduct a ""responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan"" probe of the matter.

On Tuesday, the Senate also adopted by unanimous consent its own resolution authored by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full complaint to Congress.

Earlier on Wednesday ahead of the final vote on the resolution, the House adopted an amendment to its resolution offered by Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania to make it identical to the resolution passed the day before by the Senate.

Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced the vote on the resolution on Tuesday, saying in a joint statement that ""the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress's disapproval of the Administration's effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower.""

House Democratic caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference on Wednesday morning that the resolution would demand the release of ""the full and unredacted version"" of the complaint.

""We can only imagine what is in that document and we will obtain it and the American people will be able to see it,"" he said.

Quigley asserted the whistleblower complaint ""is the political equivalent"" of Trump's claim during his 2016 presidential campaign that he could ""stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody"" without losing voters.

""What the President said during the campaign, he said he could shoot someone on the street and his base would stay with him. I guess what I read, to me, was the political equivalent of that: defying the constitution, committing a criminal act and thinking, 'Well I can get away with it,' "" he said. ""Some sort of bizarre cult of personality. Deeply disturbing what we read this morning. Alarming.""

The whistleblower complaint -- which was hand-delivered to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for lawmakers to review -- deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. A transcript of the conversation released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Democrats for now don't plan to make the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into potential obstruction of justice central to their impeachment push, which has been under review by the House Judiciary Committee, though Pelosi has told Democrats that the probe into those and other matters will continue.

The focus, however, will be squarely on the whistleblower allegations of wrongdoing by the President, as Democrats push to rapidly move forward on formal articles of impeachment as soon as this fall.

The decision to make the House Intelligence Committee initially take the lead provides more clarity over how Pelosi characterized the strategy earlier this week when she said the probe would be done by six committees under the ""umbrella"" of an impeachment inquiry. The initial description led to some confusion among members about how the investigation would take shape.

But Democratic leadership aides say that the other committees will continue their investigations -- and the focus could shift back to other elements of Trump's potential wrongdoing once the Ukraine probe plays out.

Yet broadening out the probe could also lose the support of some moderate Democrats who want the focus to stay trained on the Ukraine matter. They argue that raising concerns about Trump potentially weakening the country's security is a clearer message for voters back home.

In a news conference Thursday, Pelosi said that the whistleblower complaint is within the purview of the House Intelligence Committee and the timeline for the House's impeachment inquiry will be determined by that panel's investigation.

""The focus now is on this allegation,"" Pelosi said. ""This is a coverup.""

Pelosi added, ""When the committee finishes its work, and we have the work that has already been done by other chairs, there will be some determinations about how we proceed. But, I'm not going to go into that today.""

Democrats have zeroed in on a July 25 phone call , in which Trump pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Trump has said that the call was appropriate. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

A whistleblower's complaint released Thursday states that several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the Trump-Zelensky phone call and tried to ""lock down"" all records of it, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.

Democrats have spent months on the President's potential obstruction of justice from Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the allegations raised in the past week have motivated Pelosi to support an impeachment inquiry, removing the strongest impediment to Democrats in the House writing articles of impeachment.

The process is now expected to play out like this: The House Intelligence Committee will continue with its probe but the House Judiciary Committee will vote on the articles of impeachment before the full House takes up the matter.

Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told reporters on Thursday that his panel is ""going to move as expeditiously as possible."" The whistleblower complaint, he said, would provide a ""roadmap"" for the committee's push to interview witnesses and seek document requests over the matter.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, told CNN he would hope the panel hear from ""anybody"" who was involved in moving the record of the phone call to a different electronic system used to store classified information.

House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, declined to comment when asked whether his panel would write articles of impeachment charging the President with abuse of power. But some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee told CNN they expected they would be based at least in part on a reconstruction of the call released by the White House and the whistleblower's complaint.

""I believe the Ukraine issue will be part of an article of impeachment that shows abuse of power, abuse of office, the unpatriotic behavior of this President putting his own political gain above his oath — above our country,"" said Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. ""This will definitely be an important article of impeachment.""

""I think abuse of power is going to be a central part of the articles of impeachment,"" added Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida. ""And that's on full display in the Intelligence Committee hearing this morning.""

The intelligence community inspector general deemed the whistleblower's complaint to be ""credible and urgent,"" a conclusion that set in motion acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's appearance before Congress on Thursday.

Republicans pointed out that the whistleblower acknowledges in the complaint that he or she was not a ""was not a direct witness to most of the events described.""

""I think today was a circus that shouldn't have taken place,"" said Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican. ""I think the transcript speaks for itself. It's the best evidence of what happened, not a third-hand account from a whistleblower who wasn't there.""

""Nowhere in there did I see the words 'have to,' 'must,' 'will,' — anything that exerted the kind of undue influence that the Democrats promised was going to be in there,"" Ratcliffe added.

Democrats noted that the whistleblower cited ""more than half a dozen US officials"" in the complaint and was deemed ""credible"" by the intelligence community inspector general.

""At the end of the day, what is alleged in this whistleblower complaint goes to the very heart of the President's oath of office,"" Schiff said.

On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House would launch an ""official impeachment inquiry."" Pelosi mentioned that six committees — Intelligence, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Oversight, Financial Services and Ways and Means — would investigate under the ""umbrella"" of that inquiry. But there has been some confusion among House Democrats about how the inquiry will move forward.

When asked about Pelosi's announcement Tuesday setting up the ""umbrella"" of an impeachment inquiry, one Democratic congressman granted anonymity told CNN, ""I don't know what that means exactly.""

That lack of clarity could lead to some infighting among the committees. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Oversight panel, said that his committee has jurisdiction over ""all"" federal inspectors general.

""That's an angle we can assert in terms of jurisdiction,"" said Connolly. But when asked if it would, Connolly said, ""We've got to work out who does what.""

In a private meeting with House Democrats on Thursday, Pelosi made clear that the Intelligence Committee would be the point panel on the Ukraine investigation, given its jurisdiction and the narrow focus of its probe. Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut asked Pelosi if the five other committees should pause their work, according to a source.

Pelosi said that the other panels should continue, but made it clear the Intelligence Committee was in charge — a move that could quicken the pace of the impeachment inquiry. Some Democrats hope for a vote as soon as October.

""I think we are being thorough, but I think we are moving as expeditiously as possible as well,"" said Democratic Rep. Val Demings of Florida. ""We are not wasting any time in terms of following the facts where they lead us.""

House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York speaks during a committee hearing earlier this month in Washington.

On their July call, Trump pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner was investigated by Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,"" said Trump on the call, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

Trump also said he wanted his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Bill Barr to call Zelensky.

""We will get to the bottom of it,"" Trump said. ""I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict.""

While Biden -- when he was vice president -- and other Western leaders pushed for the dismissal of Shokin over lackluster anti-corruption efforts in 2016, Trump and Giuliani have claimed without evidence that Biden demanded Shokin's firing on behalf of his son. They cite Biden's threat to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine if the country's leaders did not dismiss the prosecutor.

On August 12, a whistleblower expressed concerns to the intelligence community's inspector general Michael Atkinson about Trump's call with Zelensky. Atkinson deemed them credible and urgent and sent the complaint to Maguire.

Trump has denied that his call with Zelensky was improper. On Thursday, Trump called Schiff ""Liddle'"" and attacked other Democrats for starting ""another witch hunt"" in a tweet.

""A whistleblower with second hand information,"" asked Trump on Twitter. ""Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!"""

After uproar over an earlier phone call mushroomed into an impeachment drama, Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday in New York City.

On the sidelines on the United Nations General Assembly -- the comedian-turned-president's debut at the gathering of global leaders -- Zelensky offered the quote that Trump most wanted. ""Nobody pushed me,"" he said.

Trump, keen to show he had not forced Kiev into investigating Joe Biden, quickly jumped in. ""There was no pressure,"" he said, turning to reporters and adding, ""You know there was no pressure. I appreciate the answer.""

The president from TV

Trauma seemed to spread across the face of Ukraine's President during his meeting with Trump -- just after the US President suggested he work more with Vladimir Putin , who invaded Ukraine and claimed a chunk five years ago.

The bullied ex-Soviet republic is desperate for America's help, but its hopes for Western assistance to a better future often flounder in the No Man's Land of post-Cold War relations. Now, Trump is suspected of temporarily holding up $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, while asking for a political favor. The sum would have been a drop in the bucket for America and the billionaire President, who requested $639 billion in defense spending for 2018. But for Ukraine it was a lifeline to counter Russian aggression.

No wonder Zelensky so obsequiously flattered Trump in their notorious July 25 phone call, which one Democrat dubbed a ""classic mob shakedown."" Trump says there was ""no quid pro quo,"" but even if that's the case, his request for an investigation into Joe Biden must have been an agonizing moment for the rookie President, who ran on an anti-corruption platform and whose only experience before being elected was playing a president on TV.

As they met before reporters here in New York, Trump treated Zelensky as a defense witness, making sure it was clear that he said he hadn't been pressured go after Biden. He also couldn't resist pointing out that Russia's annexation of Crimea fell on Barack Obama's watch, and that a Ukrainian won the Miss Universe pageant when he owned it. The contrast between Trump's parochial and personal concerns and Ukraine's existential angst was stark. It's no laughing matter for Zelensky and the heads of other states looking to the United States for geopolitical support.

""The server, they say Ukraine has it""

Also revealed in the transcript of Trump's call was his request that Kiev ""find out what happened"" with a company called Crowdstrike and ""the server."" What Trump means is not clear, but references to a missing server are common among some US political conspiracy theorists. In brief:

Crowdstrike is a publicly traded US cybersecurity firm that has been hired by Democrats and Republicans. In 2016, it was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate a hack into DNC servers.

CrowdStrike concluded that Russia had engineered the cyberattack, and US special counsel Robert Mueller later confirmed this.

Trump has rejected the notion that Russia was responsible, and asked why the DNC hired Crowdstrike to investigate instead of directly giving its servers to the FBI.

No particular DNC server has been publicly identified as missing, particularly suspicious, or in Ukraine.

The hunt is on to find an implied bribe or threat because Trump did not offer one explicitly.

The much-discussed phone call did not include an exchange where Trump said he would only release temporarily frozen military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky agreed to investigate the unusual and highly lucrative relationship between a Ukrainian firm and Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Media attention therefore shifted to the timing of President Trump’s order to freeze some $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine. The idea was to demonstrate an implicit threat and assert Trump only put a hold on the funds to pressure Zelensky into investigating the Bidens.

Both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have said there were concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the administration wanted reassurances that Zelensky – the new 41-year-old Ukrainian leader, a political neophyte and professional comedian who was scarcely taken seriously as a candidate at the outset but was handed a commanding victory by a scandal-fatigued electorate – was up to the challenge of implementing reforms.

President Trump said at the United Nations on Tuesday that he also withheld the funds because he wanted to pressure the Europeans to contribute more:

As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I’d withhold again, and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because they’re not doing it. Just the United States. We’re putting up the bulk of the money. And I’m asking, why is that?

This prompted a flurry of “fact-checking” pieces alleging Trump was lying about the relative contributions of the United States and Europe to Ukraine, in an effort to create a post hoc rationalization for withholding the funds before Democrats can impeach him for using the $391 million to blackmail Zelensky into sabotaging Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.

One big problem with this analysis is Trump did not invent the “withhold to make the Europeans pay more” on Tuesday. He complained about inadequate European contributions to Zelensky during their July 25 conversation, and Zelensky agreed with him.

“We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time, much more than the European countries are doing, and they should be helping you more than they are,” Trump told Zelensky.

“Germany does almost nothing for you,” he continued. “All they do is talk, and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way, so I think it’s something you want to look at, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.”

“Yes, you are absolutely right,” Zelensky replied. “Not only one hundred percent, but actually one thousand percent, and I can tell you the following: I did talk with Angela Merkel and I did meet with her.”

“I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine,” he added, referring to French President Emmanuel Macron.

“It turns out that even though logically the European Union should be our biggest partner, but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union, and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine – much more than the European Union, especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation,” Zelensky said.

“I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense,” he told Trump. “We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.”

The fact-checkers excoriating Trump (and, by extension, Zelensky) for underselling European support for Ukraine are missing the fact that they were clearly talking about military support, along with sanctions against Russia. They are also leaving out some very important context for why Trump and Zelensky think Europe isn’t doing enough for Ukraine, including the highly controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, a major threat to Ukraine’s economic independence.

As the New York Times pointed out on Monday, the aid for Ukraine blocked by Trump was military in nature – a major reason Trump’s hold on the funds caused such consternation at the time, because Ukraine gets far more military support from the U.S. than Europe. The aid in question consisted of $250 million from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative at the Defense Department plus $141 million from the State Department’s program for foreign military aid.

A Politico report from late August – when Trump’s critics were insinuating he froze Ukrainian military aid to curry favor with Moscow and wheedle Russia back into the G7 – quoted a senior administration official saying Trump wanted to “ensure U.S. interests are being prioritized when it comes to foreign assistance.”

This official said the president also sought assurances that other countries were “paying their fair share” – the same thing Trump said on Monday, and the same thing he told Zelensky during their phone conversation in July.

The Politico report also mentioned the long-running internal administration debate over foreign aid in general. President Trump’s complaints about the United States shouldering too much of the international foreign aid burden began long before his phone call with Zelensky.

The Obama administration refused to send any lethal aid to Ukraine at all, but Trump authorized the Javelin anti-tank missiles referred to by Zelensky during his first year in office. The aid package Trump temporarily blocked was seen as a major escalation of U.S. military aid in response to provocative actions by the Russians.

Shortly before Trump froze the aid, a U.S. News report mentioned Trump’s dissatisfaction with European contributions to Ukrainian defense, his desire to reduce U.S. contributions to a “European Reassurance Initiative” established by the Obama administration, and his criticism of Germany in particular for not contributing enough to defense projects.

As Zelensky indicated during his conversation with Trump, the Ukrainians have frequently criticized Europe, and especially Germany, for not maintaining enough pressure against Russia.

Germany’s Deutsche Welle pointed out last November that Germany has indeed refused to offer military support to Ukraine. Chancellor Angela Merkel ignored former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko’s plea for warships to provide security in the Sea of Azov after Russia seized three Ukrainian vessels.

There is also the aching sore of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Russian project that will bypass Ukraine to pump gas into Germany. Both President Trump and the Ukrainians have strongly criticized the pipeline, along with most of Eastern Europe.

“One of the important areas of our common interaction at the European level is the issue of energy security, preservation of the strategic role of the Ukrainian gas transit system and counteraction of Nord Stream 2,” Zelensky said during a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June.

The U.S. government has considered offering extensive support for Ukraine to deal with Russia knocking it out of the gas supply chain to Europe, a cost that should reasonably be added to any discussion of how much the U.S. is contributing to Ukraine’s defense against Russia.

Trump and Zelensky’s take on the contributions of Europe and especially Germany could be judged as harsh. Germany’s Chancellor Merkel is often credited with exercising great diplomatic skill with Russia on Ukraine’s behalf. Then again, with Ukrainians still dying in Donbas, the new chief executive in Kyiv could be forgiven for wondering just how much Merkel’s diplomacy is worth. There is ample evidence that such thoughts were passing through both Trump and Zelensky’s minds in June when they had their fateful phone conversation."

The hearing comes one… [+2160 chars]",Acting spy chief Joseph Maguire heads to Capitol Hill Thursday where he will publicly discuss the handling of a whistleblower complaint that includes allegations about President Donald Trump's communication with Ukraine.,2019-09-26,CNN,Acting spy chief set to testify on whistleblower complaint before House intelligence panel,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/politics/maguire-house-intelligence-committee-testimony/index.html,"Washington (CNN) America's top spy broke with Donald Trump and his Republican supporters Thursday, defending a whistleblower and intelligence committee watchdog who exposed contacts with Ukraine that could help lead to the President's impeachment.

""I believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law,"" said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , testifying before a key House committee.

But Maguire declined to say whether he spoke to the President about the whistleblower complaint that alleged that Trump solicited the help of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and that White House officials tried to hide his conduct, in the latest twist of a fast-escalating drama that has turned into the most serious crisis of Trump's presidency.

""I am not partisan and I am not political,"" said Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander who served eight presidents in uniform and was not a well-known public figure until he was thrust into the glare of the scandal.

Democrats used the high profile forum to accuse the President of abusing his power and endangering national security. Republicans tried to pick holes in the complaint, noting that the unidentified whistleblower admitted not having first-hand knowledge of events including Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky

Under intense pressure from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Maguire also acknowledged that his office consulted with the White House counsel's office after receiving a complaint detailing allegations about Trump's communications with Ukraine , because calls with foreign leaders usually fall under executive privilege.

Maguire had been accused before the hearing of caving into White House pressure not to follow the law and turn over a complaint that the intelligence community's inspector general deemed ""urgent and credible.""

The acting DNI repeatedly defended his handling of the complaint, telling lawmakers he followed the law in an ""unprecedented"" situation, despite claims to the contrary by Democrats that he infringed on their right to review the allegations.

His appearance before the committee and a closed door briefing before the Senate panel, came a day after lawmakers had their first chance to see the classified account that spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The account was declassified and released Thursday morning.

Allegations of a 'coverup'

The complaint states that several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky and tried to ""lock down"" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.

Maguire said during his testimony he did not have the authority to waive the executive privilege that covered the conversation with Ukraine's President and would not say whether he discussed the complaint with Trump.

""My conversations with the President, because I'm the director of national intelligence, are privileged, and it would be inappropriate for me, because it would destroy my relationship with the President in intelligence matters, to divulge any of my conversations with the President of the United States,"" Maguire said responding to a question from Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.

But in a tense exchange with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Maguire conceded that ""there is an allegation of a coverup.""

""But right now, all we have is an allegation — an allegation with second hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge on whether or not that is true and accurate statement,"" he said.

When asked later in the hearing if Trump asked him to disclose the identity of the whistleblower, Maguire told lawmakers,"" I can tell you emphatically, no.""

He also said no one else within the White House or DOJ asked him to identify the whistleblower.

White House consulted after complaint

Initially, Maguire seemed to waver about the chronology of events related to his handling of the complaint but ultimately told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that his office did seek guidance from the White House before raising the issue with the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice, which advised he was not legally bound to provide it to the committee.

""Such calls are typically subject to executive privilege, as a result we consulted with the White House counsel's office and were advised that much of the information of the complaint was in fact subject to executive privilege,"" Maguire said. ""A privilege that I do not have the authority to waive. Because of that we were unable to immediately share the details of the complaint with this committee.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided a redacted version to Congress that members can bring to an open hearing, a spokesperson said.

The anticipation ahead of Maguire's testimony was also amplified by the White House's decision to release a transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with the leader of Ukraine that shows the President repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is included in the whistleblower complaint, a source familiar with the situation said last week, a revelation that only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry , a move that has raised the stakes of this week's events.

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, started the hearing by accusing Trump of betraying his oath of office and compromising US national security for Trump's ""personal, political benefit,"" referring to the conduct outlined in the call transcript released Wednesday.

""It forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office: impeachment. Now this matter would not have come to the attention of our committee or the nation's attention without the courage of a single person- the whistleblower,"" he said.

GOP members question whistleblower's claim

Republicans, however, keyed in to the fact that the whistleblower acknowledged they did not have firsthand knowledge of most of the events described in the complaint.

""I was not a direct witness to most of the events described,"" the whistleblower wrote, noting that they were aware of details in the complaint pertaining to Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian President because of ""White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

But the public now has a way to test the accuracy of at least part of the whistleblower's complaint by comparing the details related to that call to the transcript released by the White House Wednesday. By all appearances, the information is consistent.

In his testimony Thursday, Maguire continued to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint , saying he was told by the Department of Justice it did ""not meet the statutory requirement of 'urgent concern,'"" required to transmit to Congress and insisted that decision was ""binding.""

""After reviewing the complaint, and the inspector general's transmittal letter, the office of legal counsel determined that the complaint's allegations do not meet the statutory requirement definition (of) legal, urgent concern, and found that I was not legally required to transmit the material to our oversight committee,"" he added.

Last week, Maguire refused to comply with a deadline to hand over a whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee that had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent,"" a conclusion that drove his push to provide Congress with the details and refer the matter to the Justice Department for consideration of criminality.

Maguire suggested during his testimony that he understood the importance of the complaint itself.

""I realized ... full and well the importance of the allegation,"" Maguire said, adding later, ""when I saw that, I anticipated having to sit in front of some committee some time to discuss it.""

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint, taken together with the transcript of President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was released earlier this week by the White House, explain why Nancy Pelosi is finally getting behind impeachment proceedings: A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.

Impeachment proceedings went ahead against President Richard Nixon because he engaged in a cover-up of a break-in at the Democratic Party office at the Watergate, of which he claimed to have no advance knowledge.

As is so often the case in Washington, it was the cover-up that rose to the level of a breach of public trust that was the grounds for impeachment proceedings against Nixon.

In Trump's case, Democrats in the House can credibly make the case that while in office Trump pressured a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent, Joe Biden, and his family. President Trump insists he did nothing wrong.

And then Trump officials, realizing that there was something unseemly about the call between Trump and the Ukrainian President made every effort, according to the whistleblower, to ""lock down"" the transcript of the call by removing the transcript from where these transcripts are generally stored and loading it on a separate computer system where only the most classified and sensitive communications are stored, despite the fact that there was no classified information in the call.

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

The document confirms reports that the “whistleblower” did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

As Breitbart News reported, “Allegations in the complaint seem to be distortions of exaggerations of information in the transcript itself, which the White House released Wednesday,” and continued:

For example, the whistleblower claims that Trump “praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Letsenko.” Trump appears never to have mentioned Letsenko, and his reference to a prosecutor (“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down”) was a reference to former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, on whose board Hunter Biden served, at the time Joe Biden demanded he be fired, under threat of withholding $1 billion in American aid.

The complaint also revealed that the “whistleblower” relied heavily on reporting from outlets such as the New York Times, the Hill, and ABC News, among others.

The unredacted transcript released by the White House on Wednesday showed no such “pressure” from the president, no quid pro quo, and no lawless behavior, as several GOP lawmakers pointed out. Nonetheless, numerous Democrat lawmakers are reacting to the release of the complaint, claiming that it proves the existence of a coverup, and likening the president to a mob boss.

“Mob bosses are smarter & more subtle in their threats than Trump was talking to Zelensky,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wrote:

According to a White House transcript of the call, Trump asked for a ""favor"" -- help from Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 contender.

""The quid pro quo is in the President's words,"" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California argued on CNN's ""New Day"" Friday, telling John Berman that Trump's phone call with Zelensky ""makes it very clear.""

""That together with withholding the funds, which preceded the phone call. All of these things are there. And that's not circumstantial,"" Garamendi said.

CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin argued on CNN Wednesday that there's ""very strong evidence that there was a quid pro quo here"" in Trump's phone call.

Toobin pointed to the section of the White House transcript in which Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine was ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US. Trump replied, ""I would like you to do us a favor.""

""He raises that at the precise moment after Zelensky raises the issue of we need money for our defense,"" Toobin said. ""Money, favor. Quid pro quo.""

Trump on early Wednesday, after the rough transcript was released, denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky. At a separate afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo.""

The rough transcript, a senior White House official said, was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening.

Lawmakers spar over issue of quid pro quo

A majority of Republicans fell in line with the White House's argument that the call summary did not provide proof of an explicit quid pro quo.

""There is no quid pro quo, no this for that. Nowhere does the President say that he will withhold military aid unless the Ukraine investigation continues. It's simply not there,"" Republican Rep. Ross Spano of Florida, a former lawyer, argued on the House floor Wednesday.

But Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-New York, also a former lawyer who spoke after Spano, said, ""You don't need to state an explicit quid pro quo when you have conducted the quid pro quo, when you have withheld the military aid.""

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said at a news conference Wednesday that the President's call amounted to a ""classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.""

""The President of Ukraine brought up his country's need for military assistance and immediately thereafter the President of the United States said, I have a favor I want to ask of you,' and would not let the subject go. There was only one message that that president of Ukraine got from that call,"" Schiff said.

Did Trump violate law?

Federal election campaign law makes it a crime for a foreign national -- directly or indirectly -- ""to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value"" and for ""a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation...from a foreign national.""

The phone call between Trump and Zelensky was part of a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and eventually was alerted to the Justice Department.

The Justice Department determined last week that there was no reason for a full-blown finance criminal investigation. What the President asked of Zelensky doesn't amount to a quantifiable ""thing of value"" under campaign finance law, top administration officials determined

The whistleblower complaint publicly released Thursday alleges that Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up.

White House lawyers were in discussion about ""how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain,"" the complaint says.

""Looking at the document as a whole, that certainly could be implied,"" George Washington law professor John Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday. ""Whether or not it could be implied and the proof is strong enough to meet a criminal standard ... the answer is probably no. But if in a civil context where the standard is much lower ... I think the answer would be clearly yes.""

Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday that it doesn't make any difference whether there is a quid pro quo or not.

""It still arguably would violate the federal election law, and therefore would be a crime,"" Banzhaf said. He added: ""When Trump asked for this information, that by itself probably violates the statute, even if there's no quid pro quo.""

Banzhaf also noted that ""thing of value"" has been interpreted ""very, very broadly.""

""It is not just money, or a flight on an airplane, or even a data set. It's anything which may be of a value to somebody else and might persuade them to do something,"" Banzhaf said, adding later, ""Pretty certainly, information which would be damaging to a possible political opponent, which would be Biden, would meet the criteria of a 'thing of value.'""

On Wednesday, Toobin had also argued that quid pro quo isn't necessary for the call to be ""wildly inappropriate and potentially impeachable.""

""The very notion of asking a foreign leader for dirt on a political opponent, independent of the issue of quid pro quo, is troubling to many, many people,"" Toobin said on CNN.

(CNN) The White House transcript of President Donald Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should cause Republicans to tremble. It reveals that the President did push Zelensky to investigate Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Before asking Zelensky to ""do us a favor"" by helping with this investigation, he reminded him that the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine.

This kind of stunning evidence of the President abusing his power is the reason that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally took the major step of throwing her full support behind the impeachment inquiry. The six committees currently investigating President Trump are now operating under one umbrella with the official mandate of determining whether to vote for articles of impeachment. Should they end up taking this vote, Trump would join a small list that includes only three other presidents who have faced impeachment since the establishment of the country (Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William J. Clinton).

The President has struck back in predictable fashion. ""A total Witch Hunt!"" and ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" were some of the first words to come in over the Twitter transom . A number of Republicans have already joined him. At the heart of the counterattack is the claim that impeachment is a radical action. The entire process, Republicans will likely continue to say, is being driven by a Democratic party motivated by its left-wing base. Trump will try to defeat Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats as President Clinton prevailed over Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in 1998

If Democrats want to retain the support of their moderate wing who have joined this cause and desire to stand any chance of winning over Republican support in the House or Senate, they will need to respond to these charges of harassment. Fortunately for Speaker Pelosi, in the case of Trump, supporters of impeachment have a series of cogent arguments to make to convince GOP members of Congress.

While much of the discussion has centered around the Democrats, the spotlight should be on the GOP. They are the party being tested. And there are four reasons why there is a clear conservative case for the impeachment of President Trump.

1. Restraining the power of presidents

Restraining presidential power should be a top priority for conservatives. Few recent presidents have exercised their power with the same level of reckless abandon as the current commander in chief. If Republicans mean what they say about championing limited government, then there really is no justification for the party's decisions since the time of Richard Nixon to continue granting power to the executive branch when their party was in power. Simply put, further empowering the President means growing the role of government. The fact that the President has so much authority, from the ability to send troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war to using executive measures to achieve policy goals like building a wall, does not square with their agenda.

Unlikely as it may seem, supporting impeachment is an unprecedented opportunity to reverse course on their hypocrisy and re-embody their own ideals. Trump has exposed, more than almost any of his recent predecessors, just how much a president can do if they are willing to ignore basic norms and if they are not scared about the potential response from Congress or the courts. Supporting the impeachment process, and possibly a decision to impeach and convict, could allow Republicans to go on record showing that they still do believe in small government.

2. Protecting national security

Protecting national security has also been a central goal of the conservative movement. During the 1980s, for instance, President Ronald Reagan railed against Democrats for being weak on defense as he pushed for higher defense spending and insisted on taking a tough stand with the Soviets. George W. Bush pushed for a proactive militaristic response to terrorist networks as well as states that he claimed threatened American interests. Yet President Trump has not done much to uphold this tradition. His coziness with Vladmir Putin has frustrated intelligence and military officials who understand that Russia has been conducting ongoing efforts to interfere in our electoral system.

The President has handled relations with North Korea in topsy-turvy fashion, doing little to produce an actual nuclear weapons agreement or halt North Korea's weapons production. His efforts to persuade Ukraine , possibly withholding military aid as an incentive to investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden, have inspired similar fears. All of this prompted seven moderate Democrats who are veterans of the military to publish their Washington Post piece endorsing the impeachment inquiry.

JUST WATCHED Pelosi on impeachment inquiry: No one is above the law Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi on impeachment inquiry: No one is above the law 02:43

3. Standing up for the rule of law

Republicans have also loved to imagine that they are the party of law and order. Ever since Richard Nixon's time in office, they have tried to assure voters that they are the party that can be best trusted to follow the rule of law and to give law enforcement institutions all the support they need. Under the Trump administration, they have so far been sitting passively as a President ran roughshod over all the institutions they have claimed to champion. Throughout his presidency, Trump has peddled mendacity and offered disinformation contradicting solid intelligence data that has been collected on matters like Russia. He has repeatedly acted with disregard for the law, he's been accused of flagrantly obstructing justice while under investigation by Mueller and refused to cooperate fully with congressional oversight.

The current scandal was triggered by the fact that the administration did not share the whistleblower complaint with Congress, as is required by law. The accumulation of evidence that the President does not abide by the rule of law is overwhelming. Republicans can only show Americans they still care about this crucial aspect of our democracy if they cooperate with this investigation.

4. Mike Pence

In addition to these three core conservative elements behind the impeachment investigation, Democrats looking to forge bipartisan accord can reiterate that if President Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be replaced by an extraordinarily conservative Republican -- Vice President Mike Pence -- who is arguably even more rightward than the President. So if this really is a left-wing effort to mount a coup, it is poorly conceived. Success would not change the balance of partisan power nor would it in any way moderate the agenda of the White House.

Based on the voluminous evidence that we already have of Trump's wrongdoing, there is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles. In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for."

(CNN) The intelligence community whistleblower complaint released publicly on Thursday ratchets up the pressure on President Donald Trump and his inner circle, as the Ukraine scandal explodes at a dizzying pace.

On the heels of Wednesday's release of an official summary of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the complaint gives us two major takeaways -- both making impeachment more likely.

First, every scandal needs a coverup, and now the Ukraine case has its very own. We learned that White House lawyers allegedly instructed other staffers to store records of the damning July 25 phone call on a server normally reserved for extremely sensitive classified information. Records of the Trump-Zelensky phone call ordinarily would have no business on such a server; according to the complaint, storage on the classified server was ""an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.""

Have questions on impeachment? Share them below, and we'll answer as many as we can.

As the whistleblower notes, the intent was to ""lock down"" evidence of the conversation. This move shows us that Trump's closest advisers recognized quickly that the call posed a major problem and bucked normal protocol to try to hide it. Lawyers call this ""consciousness of guilt"" -- meaning that when people try to hide evidence or influence witnesses or otherwise obstruct justice, they typically do so for a reason. This kind of proof can be devastating in court (or, in this case, eventually in the House and later the Senate).

The second big revelation is that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was so centrally involved in Trump's effort to push the Ukrainian government to dig for dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Giuliani already has spoken publicly (and inconsistently ) about his efforts to mine political dirt on Trump's political rivals, and the whistleblower complaint similarly casts him as a ""central figure"" in the illicit undertaking.

Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.

But Trump's attacks on the whistleblower's credibility simply don't fly. Trump's own appointed intelligence community inspector general formally deemed the whistleblower complaint credible . And the whistleblower in the complaint somehow managed to give a spot-on description of Trump's pivotal July 25 phone call. Trial lawyers call this corroboration -- meaning the witness is backed up by some reliable, outside evidence.

The House Intelligence Committee has a daunting and complex investigative task ahead of it. And the whistleblower complaint serves as a helpful roadmap. Speak with every relevant person referenced in the complaint. Subpoena any emails or texts relating to the effort to bury documents. Interview (and subpoena if necessary) State Department officials who may (or may not) have authorized Giuliani to conduct official business on behalf of the United States.

The evidence is piling up. Trump and his defenders are going into battle mode. We learned on Thursday that one of their primary targets for counterattack, the whistleblower, will not be easily dismissed or discredited."

1. Impeachment inquiry

The notion that has floated around some Democratic circles since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, through months of Mueller report drama and endless cycles of controversy, was brought to light yesterday when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into the President's conduct. The move was made after Trump admitted to withholding aid to Ukraine before a scheduled call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump pushed Zelensky to look into dealings involving the son of his possible 2020 rival, Joe Biden. Trump insists the two things aren't related, and the White House as soon as today is expected to release a transcript of the Zelensky call and a whistleblower's report related to it.

Oh, and on top of it all, Zelensky and Trump are scheduled to have their first face-to-face meeting today on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. There could certainly be a lot to talk about.

2. Climate crisis

Before the impeachment news rocked the political sphere, President Trump singled out a very different adversary: Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. After the 16-year-old's fiery speech Monday at the UN, Trump responded to a video of her with a seemingly mocking message: ""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" Thunberg ended up using his words in her Twitter bio. Meanwhile, Fox News apologized to the teen after conservative pundit Michael Knowles called Thunberg ""a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left."" The show's other guest and host both admonished Knowles on air. Thunberg has Asperger's and has said her diagnosis is a ""superpower"" that helps her activism.

3. Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe's water crisis just got more desperate. The main water treatment plant in the capital city of Harare was shut down Monday, leaving 1 million people without tap water . Authorities are now scrambling to secure water purifying chemicals to keep up with the need for clean water, and people have resorted to digging makeshift wells on their property. Zimbabwe was hit by a severe drought between October 2018 and May. Besides the water crisis, the UN food agency says more than 2 million Zimbabweans face starvation.

4. Navy suicides

The US Navy has confirmed that three sailors assigned to the USS George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia died by suicide in ""separate incidents"" last week and has launched an investigation into their deaths. None of the deaths seem to be related, and the sailors all worked in different departments. Five sailors who were assigned to the carrier have died by suicide in the last two years. The Marine Corps and the Navy have been dealing with a spike in suicides recently. The number of confirmed and suspected suicides among the active duty ranks of the two branches reached a 10-year high in 2018. After last week's deaths, Capt. Sean Bailey, commanding officer of the USS George H. W. Bush, called for the naval community to come together ""to grieve, to support each other, and to care for those in need.""

5. Plácido Domingo

Opera legend Plácido Domingo has severed his artistic relationship with The Metropolitan Opera in New York after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him. According to the Met, the decision, which ends a 50-year professional relationship, was mutual. Domingo's image was removed yesterday from the ""Macbeth"" page on the Met Opera's official website. The show was set to open today, with Domingo in the lead role. In August, the Associated Press reported that nine women detailed alleged incidents of sexual harassment spanning three decades beginning in the late 1980s. In September, 11 more people came forward with allegations that included verbal harassment and groping.

(CNN) Hubris, the Greeks tell us , can be the final downfall of the mighty, especially the mighty whose most salient trait is extreme arrogance.

Which brings us to this moment in history, and to President Donald Trump, who is now facing a formal impeachment inquiry after spending the first half of his presidency successfully trying to avoid one.

How to explain the President's behavior? How is it possible that after the country was torn apart by the Russian interference in the 2016 election and its aftermath, and after Trump himself endured almost two years under the searing spotlight of an investigation into that very thing, how is it possible that he could reach out to another country and -- according to a whistleblower complaint -- attempt another round of election interference? How is that possible?

Yes, the President and his supporters deny that's what he was doing. I suggest we all read the White House memo reconstructing the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the now-declassified whistleblower complaint and see what we think it indicates.

Zelensky, sitting on Wednesday next to Trump, the world's most powerful man, pleaded "" I'm sorry, but I don't want to be involved"" in the US election, adding ""I think and you read (in the transcript) that nobody pushed me.""

If Trump did demand that Zelensky launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a top challenger in the 2020 elections -- as appears evident from the White House transcript -- it would constitute a display of hubris worthy of Euripides.

Trump himself perfectly encapsulated the depths of his hubristic delusion when he famously declared ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters."" He just may be engaged in a metaphorical test of that theory.

Trump may survive the impeachment process because Republicans in the Senate have shown little inclination to defy him. But if he does fall, it will be in large part because he has believed the oleaginous praise he demanded. He bought his own over-the-top marketing campaign about himself.

Who can forget those nearly unwatchable televised early Cabinet meetings, where normally-dignified figures went around the table singing his praises, describing the ""incredible honor,"" the ""blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda"" and be allowed to work with such a leader. And how could Trump fail to be dazzled by the steady diet of obsequious Fox anchors, who day after day claim he may just be the best president in the history of the United States, bringing ""sunshine beaming"" through the White House, as Fox Business's Lou Dobbs put it.

JUST WATCHED Some GOP senators raising concerns over Ukraine call Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Some GOP senators raising concerns over Ukraine call 01:54

Of course, Trump has not needed much outside help to think highly of himself. He declares himself a ""very stable genius."" His Twitter feed is a torrent of adulation for the President, some of it quoting others, some provided by Trump himself (punctuated by reports of his unprecedented victimhood .)

Self-esteem, we're told, is a good thing. But we are also reminded to measure ""everything in moderation.""

Trump has apparently come to believe that he is so brilliant, so talented, so invincible, that he could get away with defying every norm, every practice, every institution of the democracy he is charged with leading. And, why wouldn't he? After all, he won the 2016 election -- though, we'll note, not the popular vote -- despite what all the experts said. And he did it after openly, publicly, asking Russia for help.

When the depths of Russian efforts to help Trump became known and fully, incontrovertibly documented, Trump still managed to survive. He survived the Mueller investigation, and continued to refer triumphantly to the scandalous episode of Russian interference to help him win as a scenario cooked up by his political adversaries, calling it to this day ""The Russia Hoax.""

Not only did he pull that off, he managed to convince a significant portion of the country that his lies are the truth and that the truth-tellers are the ""enemies of the people.""

All of this has fueled his hubris. And energized by it, he picked up the phone on July 25, the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified in Congress, and called President Zelensky -- a political novice who had played a president on TV.

When Zelensky told him Ukraine needs to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles to defend against a Russian-backed war, Trump replied, ""I would like you to do us a favor."" It sounds exactly like a suggestion of tit for tat or, in impeachment parlance, a quid pro quo.

By then, Trump had already held up the transfer of $400 million in urgently needed aid to Ukraine, a move that was exasperating and mystifying to members of Congress, which had approved the aid. But the reason for the holdup is becoming increasingly clear.

We might never have learned about all this were it not for the player who stepped on the scene in the manner of the hero in a Greek tragedy, the whistleblower. It is disheartening to know how many people in the administration have been aware of the alleged misdeeds of this presidency, and opted to keep quiet. But such are the flaws of humans. Whether or not they anger the gods, they remain a source of disappointment to those who try to do right.

Fortunately, an occasional brave man or woman rises to the challenge and, at great personal risk, takes actions to save the rest of us. That is the definition of heroism, and that is exactly what the whistleblower did. The whistleblower has given us in excruciating details an account of what happened in the White House, including the fact that the transcript of the July 25 call was not handled like a normal communication.

Instead, it was allegedly placed in a high-security computer system managed by the National Security Council, reserved for the most secret material, ""such as covert action.""

That looks very much like a cover-up. And, according to the whistleblower complaint, it was ""not the first time,"" it had happened.

The interactions with Ukraine by the President and some members of his team, notably his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, often seem more The Sopranos than the classics. And in the end, Trump may end up not only escaping removal by impeachment but also winning reelection in 2020.

It's a reminder that despite the crushing repercussions of hubris and the inspiring actions of a hero, this is, above all, a tragedy for the entire country."

(CNN) When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky greets United States President Donald Trump Wednesday in their first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the TV comedian-turned-politician must be wary and avoid being taken advantage of by the self-proclaimed master of the art of the deal.

At the same time, Zelensky must be circumspect and consider how Russian President Vladimir Putin might try to capitalize on Ukraine's being increasingly -- and unfairly -- portrayed as a cesspool of corruption.

The Trump-Zelensky meeting comes amid slipping support for Ukraine among Republican elected officials, at a time when Zelensky is deep in a high-stakes effort to bring Putin to the bargaining table. This diplomacy is part of an ambitious effort by Zelensky to make good on an election promise to end the deadly five-year military conflict with Russia in the east of the country.

Zelensky made that pledge on the premise he could count on the full security backing of the United States.

But that assumption is now at risk of falling apart for one main reason: Donald Trump.

In July, Trump, perhaps sensing weakness in the neophyte politician, allegedly tried to pressure Zelensky in a phone call to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. On Monday, CNN reported that about a week before the call took place, Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million in economic and military aid, possibly to extort Zelensky into investigating Biden's son. (Trump said Tuesday that he would release a full, unredacted transcript of the call on Thursday.)

Trusted diplomatic sources in Ukraine tell me that Zelensky will likely try to keep the meeting low-key and seek to extract an outcome that can be spun positively to the public. As Ukraine is currently in talks with the IMF for a three-year, $5 billion loan, officials might not be eager to upset the United States, one of the bank's key voting members.

Indeed, comments ahead of the meeting from Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister Vadym Prystaiko suggest that Ukraine is taking a go-softly approach with an emphasis on energy security and keeping bilateral relations robust while Ukraine remains in conflict with Russia.

But that's not good enough. Those in Trump's orbit have been issuing extraordinarily negative portrayals of Ukraine: Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump 2020 campaign, told CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Monday night that ""Ukraine has had a problem with corruption for some time,"" and Trump has asked , ""Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Given these negative portrayals in American media, the Ukrainian President needs to punch back hard -- harder than he's ever punched in his life. The negative image of Ukraine emerging from Trumpworld has played into the Russian narrative of Ukraine as a failed state, and could even give pretext to an opportunistic Kremlin for more military adventurism in Ukraine.

For Zelensky, the timing for the equivalent of a diplomatic knock-out punch is perfect, as Trump -- now dealing with a brand-new impeachment inquiry for allegedly using US taxpayer dollars, or at least the weight of his office, to pressure a foreign country to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival -- is in a significantly weakened state.

Calling out Trump would earn Zelensky respect worldwide, especially among European allies. Even more importantly, such a move would show strength to Putin at a time when Ukraine is tantalizingly close to gaining an upper hand with the Kremlin. In his first few weeks in office, Zelensky managed to negotiate a complex prisoner swap with Russia, with another reportedly in the works for October, and he may meet with Putin for the first time at an upcoming peace summit brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Further, given these high stakes, a hastily arranged meeting with Speaker Pelosi and the Congressional Ukraine Caucus could be beneficial in publicizing Ukraine's side of the story.

Astonishingly, Republican leaders, traditionally strong backers of Ukraine, have stayed silent while Trump has essentially thrown a country at war with Russia under the bus, placing Ukraine in an impossible position by withholding congressionally approved aid.

Ukrainian government officials are livid.

""The characterizations of levels of corruption in Ukraine are grossly inaccurate. With stalwart US assistance, Ukraine has done more in five years to turn its society and economy around than any other country anywhere,"" UkraineInvest chairman Daniel Bilak tells me. ""It's disappointing to hear these comments just as we are seeing a huge uptick in US investor interest in Ukraine since Zelensky's election. His government of young reformers is rolling out full-bore the most ambitious reform program in Ukraine's and perhaps the region's history.""

Even though some European countries are beginning to show weakening support for Ukraine (indeed, Macron wants a rapprochement with Russia), Ukraine is better off among European friends than working with an American administration that will do almost anything to win reelection -- including pressuring a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.

The timing is especially sensitive, as Ukraine prepares for a four-party peace summit later this fall, known as the Normandy Format and brokered by Macron. It's the best shot at a lasting peace deal Ukraine has had for a long time.

Of course, Ukraine wouldn't be where it is today without US economic and military aid, US help in avoiding crushing Russian sanctions, and US support for anti-corruption efforts. Ukraine has also benefited from crucial US backing in the UN Security Council. Contrary to claims by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that all the Obama administration did for Ukraine was to ""provide blankets,"" Washington extended $75 million in military aid in 2015, including Humvees and drones. Under Obama, the United States was the largest contributor of funds and personnel to the entity I used to work for, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. In the heady days of 2014, after Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and dispatched armed ""little green men"" to the Donbas, the mission relied heavily on guidance from US officials (as well as help from the Swiss).

But just because the United States has been a friend in the past does not mean Ukraine has to allow itself to be extorted and humiliated by a trusted ally.

When he was playing the Ukrainian president known as Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko in the Ukrainian TV comedy ""Servant of the People,"" Zelensky took a phone call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel in which she offered Ukraine membership in the European Union. The TV president exploded in a fit of joy.

Turns out Merkel had dialed the wrong number, and the news was meant for the president of Montenegro. In response, Holoborodko devolved into a profanity-laced meltdown.

The real Zelensky may want to remind himself of that made-for-TV defeat when he meets with Trump on Wednesday. The Ukrainian President should make sure he comes through with a win befitting his government of young reformers -- and the proud people of Ukraine who have suffered enough humiliation over the years from real enemies.

Zelensky has his moment set up for him. Will he use it?"

McCarthy spoke to Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday.

“Why aren’t we investigating Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?” asked Rep. McCarthy, “because I’ll promise you this: Hunter Biden — if his name was Hunter Smith, no one would’ve hired him. He wouldn’t have found a billion dollars in China, and an oligarch in Ukraine wouldn’t be hiring him.”

“But why do you have a vice president who’s running for president, who’s number one in the Democratic polls, bragging that he held Ukraine hostage to fire a prosecutor that was gonna investigate his own son?” continued the house minority leader. “Why isn’t anybody up in arms about that? And why is that not being investigated?”

Watch below:

Rep. McCarthy joined The Sean Hannity Show on Tuesday to discuss House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent announcement of the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” — which he described as simply Pelosi’s attempt to “appease the socialist wing of the [Democrat] Party.”

The Ukraine scandal involving Joe and Hunter Biden does, indeed, appear to be a touchy subject for Democrats. On Saturday, Joe Biden snapped at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, who asked the former vice president about his son’s involvement with Ukraine.

“Here is what I know,” said Biden, whilst pointing his finger repeatedly at Doocy. “I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader? If that’s what happened … that appears what happened.”

“You should be looking at Trump!” exclaimed Biden. “Ask the right questions!”

On Tuesday, Democrats saw to it that the media were looking at President Donald Trump after Pelosi announced a “formal impeachment inquiry” against the president in the wake of his reported comments regarding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Hunter Biden.

By Wednesday, however, the Democrats’ new strategy was of no avail, as the White House released the entire transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky, revealing that neither Trump nor Zelensky discussed authorized military aid payments, which disproves the claims Democrats made.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

The move comes as Joe Biden is embroiled in controversy over his son’s business dealings with foreign governments. In Ukraine, alone, the younger Biden secured a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of the country’s only independent oil and natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014.

Hunter Biden received the position, which reportedly paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry. Around the same time, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Hunter Biden’s appointment and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption is at the center of the rush by House Democrats to impeach Trump. Many on the left claim Trump allegedly broke the law by suggesting to the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, that he probe into Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma.

Joe Biden, himself, echoed that sentiment on Wednesday during a public press conference.

“If President Trump refuses to comply with congressional requests, then he will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said, before refusing to address questions from reporters. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor for Breitbart News, detailed in his book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden profited off extraordinary deals in countries like Ukraine and China that were unavailable to regular citizens.

“Joe Biden became point person to two countries, in particular, Ukraine and in China. And in both cases, his son cashed in,” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on Fox News."

The document contains no first-hand knowledge of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and relies entirely on leaks by “White House officials.” The “whistleblower” even admits: “I do not know which side initiated the call.”

Some allegations in the complaint seem to be distortions of exaggerations of information in the transcript itself, which the White House released Wednesday. For example, the whistleblower claims that Trump “praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Letsenko.” Trump appears never to have mentioned Letsenko, and his reference to a prosecutor (“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down”) was a reference to former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, on whose board Hunter Biden served, at the time Joe Biden demanded he be fired, under threat of withholding $1 billion in American aid.

In addition, the whistleblower goes beyond reporting alleged misconduct and proceeds to build a case against the president’s conduct of foreign relations with Ukraine, relying extensively on reports from the mainstream media, including the New York Times, The Hill, This Week with George Stephanopoulous on ABC News, and other sources.

That repeats a pattern from the “Russia collusion” claim, in which the FBI relied partly on media reports to justify applying for warrants to conduct surveillance on Trump campaign officials.

The document also alleges that the White House sequestered the transcript of the Ukraine phone call (though, given the fact that “Multiple White House officials” were apparently leaking its contents, perhaps there was good reason).

On Tuesday, Fox News reported that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General had found that the whistleblower had a political bias against the president and in favor of one of his 2020 rivals. The document seems to confirm that, as it devotes attention to policy arguments against Trump’s conduct of relations with Ukraine.

The whistleblower complains, for example, about decisions made by the administration, including the cancelation of a trip by Vice President Mike Pence to attend Zelensky’s inauguration.

Civiqs surveyed 1,548 registered voters September 21-24, 2019, and asked respondents whom they would support in hypothetical general election matchups featuring the president and top Democrat presidential candidates.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

“This is what the bottom line is: Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the ruling class, and the ruling class is fighting back hard as hell, and they are never going to stop,” Watters said, pointing out that Democrats had been accusing Trump of corruption since the launch of his presidential campaign.

“He beat back Spygate, the Russia hoax, he exposed Hillary and all of her corruption, and now, he’s beginning to expose the Biden family corruption in Ukraine and in China, and they want to impeach him for exposing Biden’s corruption,” Watters added.

“This is what’s going on,” he continued. “The left says they don’t believe what Biden did — abusing his power, abusing taxpayer money, and his son enriching himself — is a crime. They think it’s a crime for Trump to say, ‘Hey, can you look into that?’”

Watters concluded that the previous administration wanted to investigate Trump for crimes in 2016 “on the basis of no evidence,” using the power of a foreign country to do so.

The transcript of the July 25 call, released on Wednesday, shows Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the dealings of 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

Trump, who authorized the “unredacted” memo’s release, called Democrat efforts for impeachment nothing more than a “witch hunt.”

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”"

REP. TED LIEU: If the evidence from the whistleblower is true, there are a number of violations. The first is the American president getting a foreign power to meddle in our elections. That is unconstitutional and illegal, it’s also a violation of campaign finance laws. In addition, if the whistleblower complaint is correct — that Donald Trump had delayed military aid in order to extract leverage to get the Ukrainian leader to investigate Trump’s political opponent — that would be another article of impeachment that would look just like bribery. And third, depending on whether or not the White House provides the whistleblower’s complaint in full, it is illegal for them not to provide it in full. The law’s very clear that you must provide this complaint to Congress.

According to a transcript of the conversation released on Monday, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden’s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy firm where his son Hunter had been a board member.

Biden denied any truth to allegations, declaring that there is who has corroborated such claims, which were first reported by Breitbart Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer in his bestselling book Secret Empires.

“Look, we want to get his attention. I have 70 polls in a row showing me beating him, and that all of sudden gets his attention,” Biden said. “And so I think that’s why I’m the object of his attention.”

Kimmel went on to ask Biden whether Trump making such requests to a foreign leader amounted to an impeachable offense after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced earlier this week that the House of Representatives would proceed with an official impeachment inquiry.

“Based on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me that it’s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,” Biden said. “But look, I am confident in the ability of the House and Senate to deal with this. My job is to go out and flat-beat him.”

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) on Wednesday called for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Congress to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s potentially “corrupt practices.”

Congressman Gosar called for an investigation into Biden’s potentially corrupt practices after reading the transcript of a phone conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that happened in July 2019.

The transcript reportedly establishes that the Ukrainian government fired a prosecutor that was investigating Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his allegedly corrupt business deals. Biden reportedly threated the Ukrainian government, saying that if the government would not accede to his demands, he would withhold foreign aid to Ukraine.

The Arizona conservative contended, after reading the transcript, that Biden used his station as vice president to force a foreign nation to do something that would “personally financially benefit” his son. Gosar said that this action is in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.

Congressman Gosar explained:

I have reviewed the transcript of the phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Zelenskyy and concluded that the evidence of then Vice President Biden’s potential corruption warrants a full investigation by Congress and the Department of Justice. It appears, based on former Vice President Biden’s admission captured on video, that he used his official office as Vice President to coerce a foreign nation to take action that would personally financially benefit the Vice President’s son. This is the definition of a corrupt practice. Under federal law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, et seq. (“FCPA”), a federal government official cannot assist or intervene to influence a foreign official in their official capacity to take an act that is in violation of their domestic duties “in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.” Thus, using his official office, and using the threat of withholding official U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine, it appears Biden influenced a foreign official to stop executing their official duties which consisted of investigating Hunter Biden, in order to benefit his son Hunter Biden. This would, if proven by the DOJ, constitute a violation of the FCPA.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was enacted to prevent certain officials from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining businesses.

Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Breitbart News Saturday that the media continue to “bypass” Biden’s scandals to focus on Trump

“Accordingly, as there is a prima facie case, I am asking the Fraud Section of the DOJ, through the auspices of the Attorney General, to open an investigation of this matter,” Gosar concluded in his statement."

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

“It is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath,” Biden said in a lengthy statement following the White House’s release of the July 25th conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,” he continued.

According to the transcript, President Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden’s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy firm where his son Hunter was a board member. The former vice president bragged about the prosecutor’s ouster before the Council of Foreign Relations last year, saying that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the investigator was removed.

Numerous congressional Democrats expressed support for impeachment after the call between President Trump and Zelensky came to light, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to formally launch an impeachment inquiry.

Though Biden did not mention impeachment in his statement, the presidential candidate said he supports Democrats’ efforts to help the president “accountable.”

“Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,” he said. “In the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America’s families.”

During a joint press conference at the United Nations Wednesday, Zelensky denied that President Trump pressed him to probe Hunter Biden.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” he said.

When it was President Trump’s time to speak, he maintained that he applied “no pressure whatsoever” on Ukraine.

“Part of the problem you have is you have the fake news, you have a lot of corrupt reporting,” Trump added, once again denouncing the Ukraine call as “the single greatest witch hunt in American history.”"

The younger Biden, who has a history of getting rich from entities tied to his father, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump’s part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son’s tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption.

The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company’s board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company’s board of directors.

At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden’s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden’s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father’s position as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

The poor optics not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden’s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.

Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma.

More troubling, however, is an episode that took place in 2016, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the country’s top prosecutor.

Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin’s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

Since making his initial statement in Iowa, Joe Biden has reverted back to his long held position of refusing to discuss his son’s dealings publicly. The silence has left a lot of unanswered questions about Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma.

“Again the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?” Schweizer said during a recent appearance on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “These entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He’s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that’s what needs to be investigated.”

The question is all the more important given Hunter Biden’s history of profiting from his father’s political connections. As Breitbart News reported, the younger Biden scored a job fresh out of law school with his father’s top campaign contributor. In 1996, Hunter Biden was hired for an undisclosed position with MBNA, which at the time was one of the nation’s largest credit card companies.

The job raised eyebrows from good government groups as MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations. Hunter Biden would continue working for MBNA in one capacity or another until the mid-2000s, while his father was writing bankruptcy legislation favored by the company."

The Seattle Department of Transportation said the sign had been rented out to a contractor, National Barricade. A spokesperson for National Barricade told local news station Q13 that someone hacked into the sign’s messaging system early Wednesday morning to change the message.

The sign was changed back to its previous message around 10 a.m., and the Seattle Department of Transportation put additional safeguards in place to “prevent further incidents.”

The sign hack comes a day after 231 House Democrats voted to conduct a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over reports that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

These House Democrats backed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) initial move Tuesday afternoon by announcing an impeachment inquiry into Trump via press conference over a White House transcript between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The transcript of the July 25 call, released on Wednesday, shows Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the dealings of 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

Congressional Democrats publicly called the transcript “a smoking gun” while Republican lawmakers say the transcript has “zero” grounds for impeachment.

Trump, who authorized the “unredacted” memo’s release, called Democrat efforts for impeachment nothing more than a “witch hunt.”

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”"

The president spoke about Biden during a press conference in New York City on Wednesday.

Trump pointed to the enormous pressure put on his administration and his staff by Democrats and the media, suggesting that Biden and his family experienced nothing similar.

“When you look at all of the trauma that these fakers have caused, and the press, look, much of the press is not only fake, it is corrupt,” he said. “These stories they write are corrupt. They’re so wrong and they know that.”

Trump said that House Democrats were vicious in their pursuit of his administration.

“When you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic — smart guy, by the way — stand at the mic and act like he’s so serious, and then he goes into a room with Nadler and they must laugh their asses off,” he said."

She declared him to be as a result of that the “least patriotic of any president” in the history of the United States.

Harris said, “The president of the United States has confessed that he is attempting to collude with a foreign government to yet again manipulate the elections process of our country.

She added, “Clearly Donald Trump does not understand that his responsibility as president is also as commander in chief. But repeatedly we have seen Donald Trump as a so-called commander-in-chief because I don’t think he really fully understands the job. He takes the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community. He takes the word of a North Korean dictator over the word of the American intelligence committee. He takes the word of a Saudi prince over the word of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I’m heartened to see that people who sit on the Intelligence Committee are approaching this with a bipartisan spirit, knowing that this is about the country’s national security.”

However, his assertion is patently false. The poll did not ask a broad question on impeachment. Rather, the results he cites are in reference to a very specific question, asking respondents if they would support impeachment in the event that President Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to push Ukrainian leaders to dig up dirt on his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden (D), as well as his son.

The question is as follows: “If President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, would you support or oppose impeachment?”

In that specific scenario, 55 percent would support impeachment. The results do not suggest that the majority of Americans support an impeachment inquiry, as McManus suggested.

“What?! This is false,” National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) senior advisor Matt Whitlock remarked, pointing to the specifics of the question:

A slew polls have paralleled Quinnipiac’s findings, with the majority of Americans opposing impeaching the president. Despite lack of public support or a legitimate impeachable offense, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) officially announced the formal impeachment inquiry this week.

As Breitbart News reported, every Democrat member of the House went on the record to support the latest impeachment effort thanks to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who forced the House to vote on a resolution “formally condemning the way in which Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry.”

A whistleblower has alleged Trump violated federal campaign finance laws by threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky’s government investigated the former vice president and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden for corruption.

The White House released on Wednesday a transcript of the call in which the two heads of state discussed Biden, but the transcript showed no discussion of military aid or any quid pro quo.

In the phone transcript, Trump said:

There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

In a statement, Pelosi accused President Trump of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

The transcript, released earlier Wednesday, shows President Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

Democrats have latched on to the request, claiming the president appeared to have threatened to hold back military aide from Ukraine unless it investigated the Biden family.

“The release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,” said Pelosi.

On Tuesday, President Trump said he asked White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold the aid from Ukraine roughly one week before he spoke with Ukraine’s leader.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said ahead of his address before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

During a press conference on Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry in light of the Trump-Zelensky.

“I’m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of an impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable,” she stated.

President Trump on Tuesday blasted Pelosi’s decision to begin proceedings to oust him from the Oval Office, tweeting: “There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have.”

“The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,” he added. “They get nothing done.”"

Pence was at MacAllister Machinery to talk about the United States-Mexico-Canada deal that the Trump administration has negotiated to replace NAFTA.

Earlier in the day, the House Intelligence Committee held a hearing on a whistleblower complaint alleging that President Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 elections.

The complaint was based largely on a phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine. The president has denied any wrongdoing and the White House released the transcript of that call on Wednesday.

Still, Democrats at the hearing claimed that Trump acted inappropriately by asking the Ukrainian president to help Attorney General William Barr, who is looking into the origins of the 2016 Russia collusion allegations, and to assist his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who is looking into reports of Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden working for a Ukrainian company that was under investigation by Ukraine’s top prosecutor.

Biden, as vice president, worked to get the prosecutor fired, even bragging that he withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine until he was fired. Biden has dismissed allegations of acting inappropriately."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), also known as “AOC,” doubled down on calls to impeach President Trump, even after the White House released a transcript of a call between him and the Ukrainian president — which reports had suggested would show Trump dangling military aid to get him to investigate Joe Biden’s son but did not.

Ocasio-Cortez then tweeted:

Also – what they are calling a “transcript” isn’t even a transcript. It’s a collection of notes. This is what they are *admitting* to and it’s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment. The President engaged in an outright betrayal of our country.

On Tuesday, before the transcript’s release, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was launching an “official impeachment inquiry” into President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the “Squad” have long-called for Trump’s impeachment and suggested that Pelosi would catch up to their calls.

The transcript showed that Trump asked Zelenksy to help him look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Zelensky mentioned that one of his assistants spoke to Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, who is looking into Joe Biden’s dealings in Ukraine.

The entirety of Trump’s remarks about Biden:

There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it. … It sounds horrible to me.

The transcript showed that Zelensky was eager to provide Trump with assistance with both matters.

The inspector general’s report has, thus far, been withheld by the administration.

Democrats allege that the Trump administration is violating the law in keeping the report from Congress, which was the chief reason cited Tuesday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for changing her mind and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

It is not clear why the administration had withheld the report, though the White House announced Tuesday that it will release the report Wednesday, along with the transcript of Trump’s conversation with the new president of Ukraine.

Henry, citing a “senior official” with first-hand knowledge of the inspector general’s report, said that the anonymous “whistleblower” — who did not hear Trump’s conversation directly — was biased in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 opponents, though the official did not say which one.

Henry also said the official had told him that there would be no “smoking gun” in the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — even though there would be “at least a few words” in it that would cause unspecified problems for the White House.

Hannity added that his sources had also told him that Trump and Zelensky had only briefly discussed the aborted investigation into a company on whose board Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, had served. Biden boasted last year that he had forced the Ukrainian prosecutor out by threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid.

He noted the level of investigations and criticism targeting him, his family, his businesses, and his administration was unprecedented.

“This should never be allowed to happen to another President,” he wrote. “Witch Hunt!”

Pelosi announced Tuesday she would begin an impeachment inquiry of the president after a whistleblower claimed using secondhand knowledge that the president held an inappropriate call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for corruption.

News of Trump’s decision to freeze aid to Ukraine before eventually relenting raised accusations from Democrats he was holding it ransom until the Ukrainian government investigated Biden. The president has denied this, promising to release a transcript of the phone call with Zelensky on Wednesday.

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,” he wrote on Twitter.

President Trump is expected to meet with Zelensky on Wednesday, as he continues participation in the United Nations summit in New York City.

Trump also expressed optimism on Tuesday that American voters would see through Pelosi’s effort to impeach him.

“The good news is the voters get it,” he said. “This is why they say it’s good for the election, but you know what? It’s bad for the country, what she’s doing is very bad.”"

In worse news for impeachment-crazed Democrats, only 46 percent of Democrats call it treason. In other words, not even a majority of Democrats are buying this manure.

As far as the rest of the electorate, only 24 percent of independents call it treason, as do 11 percent of Republicans. (Another word for those 11 PERCENT OF Republicans might be “cucks.”)

Rasmussen adds this key piece of context: “By way of comparison, that’s lower than the number who believe President Trump committed treason in his dealings with the Russians.”

That number that entered the thirties, and we all know where that whole Russia Collusion thing ended up.

As far as those who believe Trump should now be impeached, that number has not budged throughout the week-long Ukraine Hoax — 44 percent.

Rasmussen, the founder of Rasmussen Reports, who is now an independent, also found that this fake scandal has not damaged Trump’s job approval ratings, which remain steady at 47 percent. On the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Trump’s job approval rating sits at a relatively healthy 45 percent, little changed from last week.

On the question of the call itself, only 43 percent of voters believe Trump behaved inappropriately; this includes 66 percent of Democrats, 45 percent of independents, and 15 percent of Republicans.

While only 18 percent of Democrats believe the call was appropriate, 58 percent of Republicans say it was, as do 20 percent of independents. The rest are not sure.

This Ukraine Hoax does appear to be hurting former Vice President Joe Biden. When the pollster asked, “Which Democratic presidential candidate had been accused of inappropriate dealings with Ukraine, 56% selected Joe Biden and 29% were not sure.”

The partisan breakdown in the Biden number is 52 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of independents, and 66 percent of Republicans. What that tells you is that despite the corrupt media’s attempt to protect Biden from the news that his son made millions from a Ukrainian energy company (when he has no energy experience whatsoever), the news is still getting out, which might explain the slow leak in Biden’s poll numbers.

These Rasmussen numbers are terrible for the Democrats and their media handlers, who have pushed all their chips into the middle of the impeachment table. Thanks to the eternal wisdom of America’s Founding Fathers, impeachment is deliberately set up as a political process, which means it can only be done with the will of the people, which means Democrats have painted themselves into a corner that only ends with Trump being able to claim he’s been exonerated, which is exactly what happened with the Russia Collusion Hoax.

You can’t overturn a presidential election with numbers like these, and with the Ukraine Hoax, this is going to be as good as it gets for Democrats. The transcript of the phone call was supposed to be the smoking gun, but as we all saw and as this poll makes clear, there was 1) nothing smoking and 2) no gun. It wasn’t even a cherry bomb or a mouse fart.

It’s a steaming pile of Hoax.

I guess they figured it’s easier than flying to South Dakota with picks and chisels and carving Trump into Mount Rushmore. But it will have the same effect.

Now that the transcript has been released, it’s the New York Times that doesn’t want anyone to see it.

The transcript I’d like to see is the one of Nancy Pelosi reading the Trump transcript.

F@@@@@@CK! Whose f***ing idea was it to demand this goddamn transcript?

F@CK!

F@@CK!

F@@@CK!

The absolute worst version for Trump — i.e. the one being repeated non-stop on MSNBC — is that he did exactly what Obama and Biden were doing to Ukraine: intimidating an ally into giving us something in exchange for the foreign aid we were giving them.

Biden himself bragged about getting Ukraine’s prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold a big fat check from them.

The Democrats’ argument is: No, no, no! When WE were pressuring Ukraine, we were doing it for good! Don’t you understand? We’re good; they’re bad.

The other reason the media are going to have to bury this transcript is that Trump brought up a few items that the media have been hoping the public would never find out about.

Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Well, that’s something the media haven’t mentioned before. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will be hearing about the funny business with Biden’s son, Hunter, for the first time with the release of this transcript.

Why did Vice President Biden order the Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor investigating the Ukrainian company paying his son millions of dollars? Are Democrats claiming that this company was clean as a whistle and it was an absolute OUTRAGE that it was being investigated?

Ukraine was looking into the company that conveniently placed Hunter Biden on its board long before Trump came on the scene. Something must have made the Ukrainian prosecutor want to investigate Biden’s company — and it sure wasn’t to curry favor with the Obama/Biden administration.

The second issue the media does not want anyone to think about is CrowdStrike.

What is CrowdStrike, you ask? That is the cybersecurity firm that is the sole source of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC’s emails — which launched the conspiracy theories that tied our country in knots for the past three years.

The Russian collusion story was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 to cover up the utter corruption revealed by the dump of Democratic National Committee emails on Wikileaks. As was her practice whenever a scandal threatened to engulf her, Hillary rushed out and told the press to investigate something else.

And “the great story” about the DNC email hack wasn’t about a “vast right-wing conspiracy” — as she claimed when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. No, this time, it was a vast Russian conspiracy!

At the time, the entire media laughed at Hillary’s Russian conspiracy nonsense — the New York Times, New York Newsday, the Los Angeles Times, and so on. But then Trump won the election, and suddenly the Russia conspiracy seemed totally believable. What else could explain how Americans could put this boob in the White House?

The subsequent three years of breathless Russia coverage was based entirely on the word of one cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, that the DNC’s emails had been hacked by Russia.

Recall that the DNC wouldn’t allow the FBI or any other U.S. government official anywhere near its computers. That’s precisely why so many cybersecurity experts doubted that it was the Russians: The FBI was never allowed to perform its own investigation.

CrowdStrike was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen apparently — because who isn’t?) and funded by the fanatically anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk Foundation.

Talk about interfering with our democracy! Alperovitch and Pinchuk sent one political party and nine-tenths of the American media off on a wild goose chase into Russian collusion that, after years of accusations, investigations and embarrassing conspiracy-mongering … turned up goose eggs.

The entire Russian insanity was launched by a couple of Ukrainians. I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.

This is why Trump said to President Zelensky: “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

(How’d you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)

Trump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it’s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son’s back. Maybe Biden’s son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It’s not Trump’s fault that Biden is now running for president.

I’ll give the Democrats this: They’ve gotten so good at trying to remove Trump from office that, instead of three years, their insane accusations blow up in their faces within a week."

According to the complaint released Thursday, the officer claimed Ulrich Brechbuhl listened into the July 25th call between the president and Zelensky and that several State officials were later briefed on the details of their discussion.

The nine-page complaint addresses President Trump’s call with Zelensky, in which the president discussed, separately, both U.S. military aid to Ukraine and allegations of potential wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

While President Trump suggested Zelensky look into the Bidens, the Ukrainian president has vehemently denied being pressured to do so.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call.

Phil Scott became the nation’s first Republican state chief executive this week to support congressional Democrats’ formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, saying Congress possesses a “solemn responsibility” to hold the president accountable.

Scott, a staunch critic of President Trump, argued in a Wednesday statement that while an impeachment probe is “appropriate,” lawmakers on Capitol Hill must further investigate the matter before reaching a conclusion whether to oust the president. His comments came a day prior to the House intelligence committee released an anonymous federal employee’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint against President Trump, which is now at the center of a congressional impeachment investigation.

The complaint, submitted by an unidentified intelligence official, addresses President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the president suggested the Kiev leader to investigate the son of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The complaint claims White House officials were concerned enough about the contents of the phone call that they moved to “lock down” the record of the communication. The whistle-blower was concerned President Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country,” it states.

“The interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals,” the complaint states. “The president’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.”

However, according to a transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday, its contents show no pressure for Ukraine to probe the Biden family, and President Zelensky denied he felt any pressure to look into the former vice president or his son, Hunter Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.)

Nonetheless, following the transcript’s release House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) re-upped her support for a formal impeachment probe, accusing the president of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

The so-called “whistleblower’s” complaint was released shortly before acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire appeared before the House intelligence committee to discuss the handling of the complaint. The hearing began at 9 a.m. EDT and is being streamed live"

The demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post.

Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden — even without a quid pro quo — was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.)

Thiessen observed (original links):

It got almost no attention, but in May [2018], CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”

The Democrats’ letter is available online here. In it, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: “This reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal — to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community — about your government’s commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.”

The actor, who is married to Ukranian-born star Mila Kunis, also claims to have met Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife.

Kutcher’s statements come as he faces negative publicity stemming from ex-wife Demi Moore’s new memoirs Inside Out, in which the Ghost actress alleges that Kutcher was unfaithful during their marriage and that she engaged in threesomes with him.

Earlier this week, Kutcher tweeted a phone number, asking his followers to text him for the “truth.”

For truth text me. +1 (319) 519-0576 — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) September 25, 2019

Yahoo Entertainment reported that the number sent out a series of automated text messages in which Kutcher semi-coherently expounded on Trump and the impeachment inquiry underway in the House. Kutcher’s number no longer appears to be sending out the Trump-themed text messages.

The That 70s Show star reportedly said in one text message that Trump should be impeached even if he didn’t use the prospect of financial aid to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden.

“If our president used that financial aid to leverage president Zelensky to investigate Biden should be impeached. If our president did not use it as leverage and simply encouraged president Zelensky to investigate Biden without cause he should be impeached.”

Kutcher also texted: “If you like President Trump or not America is the priority soliciting foreign interference in our election in [sic] unAmerican.”

In another text message, Kutcher says he and Kunis met with Zelensky and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Kutcher’s claim appears to be true, with Zelenska posting photos of the two couples on her official Instagram account.

Kutcher posted Wednesday a series of tweets that were veiled attacks at Trump.

“Buzz words: witch hunt, collusion, fake news. Ignore it all just look at facts,” the actor tweeted.

Unlike many of his fellow Hollywood stars, the 41-year-old Kutcher has largely refrained from publicly voicing his opinions of Trump, although he did once urge Ivanka Trump on Twitter to push gun control.

But the allegations contained in Moore’s new book have cast Kutcher in an unflattering light.

Kutcher appeared ready to respond to the allegations in the book, but said he ultimately decided to delete it.

Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call – got them by surprise! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019

The president released the transcript shortly after his message on Twitter, which revealed that Trump spoke to Zelensky about the investigation of meddling in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s possible corrupt behavior in the country.

Below is the relevant portion of the transcript

Trump: … I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me. President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I’m knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.

The president asked Zelensky to coordinate with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to discuss the investigations.

“Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy,” he said. “If you could speak to him that would be great.”

The president also pointed to a Breitbart News report that Democrats also reached out to Ukraine to ask officials to cooperate with an investigation."

“The Democrats, they went down to see the president of Ukraine and they asked him for all sorts of things,” Trump said, noting that Democrats urged Ukrainians not to cooperate with Republicans and remain aligned with the Democrats as if it was a “political war.”

U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018, urging them to cooperate with investigators in the Russia investigation and the investigation of President Donald Trump.

“They shouldn’t have done that,” Trump said. “That should be an impeachable event … tremendous pressure on Ukraine.”

Trump noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement saying that the president put no pressure on him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption.

He again argued that he halted foreign aid to Ukraine to see if other countries would help Ukraine with defense aid, and condemned the Democrat’s impeachment process as the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.”

After releasing a transcript of the call, Trump said that the conversation was proven “friendly.”

“There was no pressure. The way you had that built up, that call, it was going to be the call from hell,” he said. “It turned out to be a nothing call.”

The call transcript confirmed that Trump asked Zelensky about a possible investigation into Biden and his son for their actions in Ukraine.

Trump accused the establishment media for fueling the ongoing controversy over his phone call after a whistleblower raised concerns about the content of the call based on second-hand information.

“So, part of the problem you have is you have the fake news,” he said. “You have a lot of corrupt reporting, there’s some very fine reporters and journalists, but you have a lot of corrupt reporters, a lot of corrupt journalists.”"

Trump spoke of a letter that three Democratic senators wrote in 2018 to Ukraine's prosecutor general, claiming, ""In the letter they implied that their support for US assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing they wouldn't get any assistance. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar?""

He accused Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of having ""literally threatened"" Zelensky during a recent trip to Ukraine, alleging that Murphy said ""that if he doesn't do things right they won't have Democratic support in Congress.""

Later in the press conference, Trump said: ""I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did. But the only difference is I didn't do it...There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with these senators. And they threatened -- they said, 'You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes.' That's the real deal.""

JUST WATCHED Tapper: First, let's note, Trump said a lot of things that aren't true Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper: First, let's note, Trump said a lot of things that aren't true 01:28

We fact checked Trump's claims about Biden and Ukraine here . This time, let's start with the letter.

A request, not a threat

Facts First: The 2018 letter from Sens. Patrick Leahy, Dick Durbin and Bob Menendez did not include any threat at all, about US assistance to Ukraine or anything else; it did not even mention US assistance.

Rather, it expressed concern about a New York Times article that said Ukraine had -- with the aim of avoiding Trump's anger -- stopped cooperating with the Robert Mueller investigation and frozen investigations into the Ukraine-related activities of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman.

It urged Ukraine to ""reverse course"" if the Times story was accurate.

Manafort, a longtime lobbyist, had worked as an adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, receiving millions of dollars for his work . He was subsequently convicted of multiple financial crimes related to payments he received from Ukraine, which he laundered to avoid paying taxes.

It is difficult to conclusively fact check Trump's claim that the Democrats' letter ""implied"" that assistance to Ukraine was at stake; different people read between the lines differently. But the plain language of the senators' letter does not appear to even hint at withdrawing aid to Ukraine, and the senators say they were not doing so.

""The Senators' letter was written in response to a New York Times report that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General was considering not cooperating with the Mueller Probe out of concern that President Trump would cut off aid as punishment. The Senators' letter in no way calls for the conditioning of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine,"" the senators said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

The letter was written while Petro Poroshenko was president of Ukraine. It said the senators were ""disappointed"" that ""some in Kiev"" appeared to have cast aside principles of their shared relationship like ""respect for the rule of law and accountable democratic institutions"" in an attempt to ""avoid the ire of President Trump.""

""If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation,"" the letter said.

The letter concluded with three questions to Ukraine's prosecutor general. It asked whether his office had indeed taken steps to stop cooperating with Mueller, whether anyone acting for the Trump administration had asked Ukraine to do so, and whether the Mueller probe had been raised during previous bilateral meetings between the two countries.

Urging an investigation?

Trump was not the only prominent Republican to wrongly describe the letter. In a tweet earlier on Wednesday, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, ""In 2018, Democrat Senators wrote a letter to Ukraine, urging them to investigate @realDonaldTrump.""

On Thursday morning, Trump retweeted a tweet from his son Donald Trump Jr. that amplified another Twitter user's claim that the Democrats' letter had asked Ukraine to ""investigate Trump.""

Facts First: The letter did not call for any investigating of Trump. Again, the senators urged the prosecutor not to stop existing investigations and not to stop cooperating with Mueller because they were worried about Trump's reaction, and they asked if the Trump administration had encouraged Ukraine to stop cooperating.

The claim about Murphy

We don't know exactly what Murphy said to Zelensky during their meeting three weeks ago, which Murphy said was attended by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, so we can't call Trump's claim true or false.

""I told Zelensky that he should not take orders from Trump's campaign and that his credibility would be greatly compromised if he interfered in the 2020 election. That's common sense, and I stand by what I said. 100%,"" he said.

Murphy also said in a written statement that he had also told Zelensky ""that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign."""

Mike Turner said Thursday that the controversial conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President is ""not OK,"" a notable comment as most of his colleagues remain largely defensive toward Trump after the House launched an impeachment inquiry.

""I've read the complaint, and I've read the transcript of conversation with the President and the president of the Ukraine,"" Turner said during a House Intelligence Committee hearing with the acting director of national intelligence. ""Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the President: This is not OK. That conversation is not OK.""

""I think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the (conversation's) transcript,"" the Ohio Republican said.

Turner's critical comments add to a small but growing list of remarks by Republicans who have expressed concern over a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressured him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The conversation with Zelensky has led to a House impeachment inquiry into the President's actions, with Democrats claiming Trump abused his office by asking Ukraine to investigate his political opponent. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

As acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House panel on Thursday, many congressional Republicans told CNN that they hadn't yet read the complaint, which was released to the public earlier in the day.

James Biden, who has a history of murky financial dealings, allegedly promised a Florida-based dental company, Integrate Oral Care, that the Biden Cancer Initiative “would promote their business.” The promise came in November 2018 as James Biden and his business partners were weighing an investment in the company, according to Politico.

“James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients,” the outlet noted.

The revelation comes after Integrate filed a suit against James Biden and Platinum Global Partners in June, claiming they never followed through on a promise to investment $3 million into the company. The suit is similar to one filed in Tennessee against James Biden in which the former vice president’s brother is accused of defrauding a rural healthcare company.

Unlike the Tennessee suit, however, the Integrate suit marks the first mention of the Biden Cancer Initiative — a non-profit set up by the former vice president after leaving the White House. In June, the organization, which did not fund cancer research but rather convened major institutions to work on the issue, suspended its operations indefinitely after questions were raised about the influence its donors would have on Biden were he to be elected president in 2020.

James Biden is not the only member of the former vice president’s immediate family to draw scrutiny for his business dealings.

Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s youngest son, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. In particular, there are serious questions over how Hunter was able to secure a seat on the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest independent oil and gas company — Bursiam Holdings — in 2014. Hunter secured the position, which reportedly paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite no prior background in Ukraine or the energy industry.

Ethics watchdogs have highlighted the fact that a month prior to the appointment, Joe Biden was tapped as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. At the same time, Burisma was attempting to court western leaders , even going to the extent of hiring a Washington, D.C. lobbyist with ties to then-Secretary of State John Kerry, after its assets had been frozen in the United Kingdom on suspicion of money laundering.

It was this tie and the subsequent pressure Joe Biden placed on the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating the company for corruption in 2016, that Trump believes should be probed in Ukraine."

Wednesday that ""it's awful hard to avoid the conclusion"" President Donald Trump committed ""an impeachable offense"" by pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden.

It was the furthest Biden has gone on the subject of Trump's impeachment -- which most of the other leading 2020 Democratic presidential contenders have called for.

Asked how the matter ranks on the ""outlandish scale"" of American politics, Biden said: ""18 out of 10.""

Biden's comments came the day the White House released a transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky.

By the way, having hundreds of millions of dollars in aid held up. Could you explain why this is wrong and also extremely dangerous.

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: I fully appreciate the need for a President of the United States to have conversations with leaders of other countries and some of that may want to be held close to the vest as part of his job. But, I don’t think it’s part of his job to shakedown leaders of other countries using taxpayer dollars to have them do something that is in his political benefit. It’s wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and you have the President of the United States asking for that. Now we’re engaged in a cover-up of that cover-up. Two wrongs do not make a right and they know how wrong it is.

I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way. We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100% confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The possible super PAC is far from operational, but Larry Rasky, a former Biden aide, has led the effort to stand up an outside group that he believes would help the former vice president rebut attacks that could impact Biden's standing in the crowded and contentious Democratic primary. While Biden is still seen as a front-runner in the race, recent polling has shown his once-large lead slipping as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rises in the field

""For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,"" Rasky said. He added that he has begun to think ""the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we'd need to fight this.""

""The campaign is fighting a war on two fronts -- the primary and the general election -- at the same time. They certainly need all the support they can get.""

News of the super PAC, which was first reported by The New York Times , was not welcome inside Biden's campaign. Biden's team, from the outset of his presidential bid, has said they would disavow any outside spending on the former vice president's behalf. This case is no different. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, reiterated Friday that the campaign would reject any help from outside super PACs.

""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" Ducklo said. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.""

A source familiar with the internal Biden campaign strategy, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the outside effort, put a finer point on it.

""The campaign had its best week of fundraising since the second week after launching, and it would be impossible to miss from anywhere on earth that Donald Trump is panicked about Joe Biden,"" the source said. ""The campaign doesn't need or want this effort, and anyone engaging in it doesn't have its best interests at heart.""

Rasky said he expected that his prospective effort would be disavowed by the campaign, but he and others still believe the outside group is needed to rebut attacks leveled by Trump and other Republicans.

""We are dead serious about the need to do it,"" Rasky said. ""But we are also mindful of the campaign's position and the Vice President's expressed desire not to have one. That is a lot for us to ponder.""

Biden's campaign is not the first to have a super PAC considering spending on its behalf. A super PAC ran ads in support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee during his now-ended presidential bid. And top Democratic donors considered launching a super PAC to help New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this year. Booker did not back the effort.

A source close to the possible super PAC said that while its focus would be to respond to attacks from Trump and other Republicans, they would not rule out responding to Democratic attacks on Biden.

""That's not what it is for,"" the source said, ""but if Biden is attacked, we need to defend him."""

The complainer admits, “I was not a direct witness to most of the events described.” Still, the so-called whistleblower goes on to allege that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

The transcript of the phone call authorized for release by President Trump evidences no such pressure or quid pro quo and shows the request to investigate alleged corruption involving Biden and his family was a small part of the call.

The “whistleblower” concedes that his information is based on secondhand knowledge: “However, I found my colleagues’ accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.”

One key section of the so-called whistleblower’s document claims that “multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.”

This was allegedly to follow up on Trump’s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the “cases” mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower’s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.

Even though the statement was written in first person – “multiple U.S. officials told me” – it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

That footnote reads:

In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.

The so-called whistleblower’s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:

Write that Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko “also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.”

Document that Trump adviser Rudi Giuliani “had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.”

Bolster the charge that, “I also learned from a U.S. official that ‘associates’ of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.” The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, “I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.”

The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a “joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.”

BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.

The OCCRP and BuzzFeed “joint investigation” resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump’s political rivals.

The so-called whistleblower’s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

“Two Unofficial US Operatives Reporting To Trump’s Lawyer Privately Lobbied A Foreign Government In A Bid To Help The President Win In 2020,” was the title of the BuzzFeed piece.

OCCRP’s article was titled, “Meet the Florida Duo Helping Giuliani Investigate for Trump in Ukraine.”

The charges in the articles seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower’s own claims.

Soros, Google, Omidyar Network

The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) describes itself as a “non-profit media organization providing an investigative reporting platform for the OCCRP Network.”

Using generalized phraseology, it states, “We now connect 45 non-profit investigative centers in 34 countries, scores of journalists and several major regional news organizations across Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.”

Every page of the OCCRP website features the same bottom section listing the icons of four of the organization’s top funders, including Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Indeed, OCCRP provides a hyperlink to the webpage for Soros’s Open Society at the bottom left corner of every page on OCCRP’s own website.

Soros’s Open Society was listed as the number two donor in most of the annual financial records posted on OCCRP’s website starting in 2012. Some years list Soros as the organization’s top donor.

OCCRP advertises its other funders, including Google, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the U.S. State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.

Together with Soros’s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are “disputed.”

Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute’s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros’ Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy.

The Omidyar Network has partnered with the Open Society on numerous projects and it has given grants to third parties using the Soros-funded Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to left-wing causes in the U.S.

And OCCRP seems to have gone to bat for Soros on several occasions.

One such example is an OCCRP article titled, “How Macedonia’s Scandal-plagued Nationalists Lobbied America’s Right and Pulled Them Into an Anti-Soros Crusade.”

That piece targeted Breitbart News as well as conservative groups and Republicans, claiming, “Conservative media outlets, such as Breitbart and Fox News, as well as the right-wing Heritage Foundation, have devoted considerable coverage to Soros’ alleged meddling in Macedonia.”

“And more than a dozen Republican congressmen have written critical letters questioning the U.S. embassy and Ambassador Jess Baily for working with Soros-linked NGOs.”

Macedonia has been a center of Soros’s action network, with the Open Society boasting in its literature that it spent some $98.7 million funding groups in Macedonia since 1992.

OCCRP has also repeatedly targeted Hungary’s nationalist government over its opposition to Soros-funded groups that Hungary accuses of meddling in internal affairs.

Soros Group and Fusion GPS

As first reported by the Daily Caller, IRS filings showed the Democracy Integrity Project, a nonprofit funded by Soros, in turn hired firms tied to Fusion GPS and anti-Trump dossier author Christopher Steele for more than $3.8 million in 2017.

The Daily Caller reported:

The group paid $3.3 million to Bean LLC., the holding company that controls Fusion GPS. Another $250,000 was paid to Walsingham Partners Ltd., a London-based firm owned by Steele and his partner, Christopher Burrows. TDIP paid another London-based intelligence firm called Istok Associates Ltd. nearly $150,000, also for “research consulting.” The company has released investigative reports looking into whether Russia helped fund the Brexit campaign. Nearly $130,000 was paid to Edward Austin Ltd., a London-based intelligence consultancy operated by Edward Baumgartner, a Fusion GPS contractor. Another $148,000 was paid to the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, which has represented Fusion GPS in a variety of dossier-related legal matters.

Questions Surround Biden Family Over Ukraine Dealings

In his phone call with Zelensky, meanwhile, Trump asked him to investigate Biden and his son, the transcript relates.

The transcript reads:

The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Entirely missing from much of the news media coverage is the larger context of the story, which spotlights significant questions about Biden’s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period where his son, Hunter Biden, received $50,000 a month from a natural gas company there.

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

Biden boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. Joe Biden claims no wrongdoing.

The explosive charge is among the reasoning cited in Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee Michael Atkinson's report which said the complaint by a whistleblower , which detailed the July 25 call and other moves by the Trump administration regarding Ukraine, amounts to an ""urgent concern"" and ""appears credible"" -- two statutory requirements considered as whistleblower allegations progress through review.

""In the ICIG's judgment, alleged conduct by a senior US public official to seek foreign assistance to interfere in or influence a Federal election... would also potentially expose such a US public official (or others acting in concert with the US public official) to serious national security and counterintelligence risks with respect to foreign intelligence services aware of such alleged conduct,"" Atkinson wrote.

Despite the inspector general's transmitting of the whistleblower's complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire along with his finding of ""urgent concern"" in late August, the complaint was not sent to Congress until this week.

In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday, Maguire said that he consulted with the White House counsel's office and later the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel after receiving the complaint for guidance on how to handle it.

That defense goes like this: Donald Trump never said to Zelensky, ""I won't do X unless you give me Y."" He never said the phrase ""quid pro quo."" Therefore, nothing to see here!

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Asked by the Boston Globe's Jess Bidgood what he would consider a quid pro quo from Trump to Zelensky, Graham replied

""'Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain't gonna give you any money,' [He'd] be really, like, thuggish about it.""

Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lawyers, made a very similar argument in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night . ""I think it's important to understand what we don't have, and what we don't have is a quid pro quo,'"" said Sekulow. ""In other words, 'I will do this, you do this.' That is absent.""

So, that's the bar? Really?

Take the logic of Graham and Sekulow out of this context and put it in an entirely different one. If someone comes up to you on the street, points a gun at you and says, ""Give me all your money!"" then, under Graham's conceit, you aren't being robbed. In order for it to be an actual robbery, the man pointing the gun has to say: ""Give me all your money. This is a robbery.""

Makes zero sense, right? You know what's happening even if the guy doesn't declare that he is using the threat of possible violence to separate you from your money. Why? Because, well, you just know. The human brain is able to look at a series of related inputs -- gun, demand for money, agitation -- and connect the dots: I am being robbed.

Now, circle back to Trump's conversation with Zelensky. To revisit that conversation

1. Trump, after congratulating Zelensky on his win, very quickly establishes that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.

""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

2. He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US.

""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr.

""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""

5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion.

""I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.""

Soooooooooo, yeah.

Graham and Sekulow are technically correct that Trump didn't directly tell Zelensky that if he wanted what the US had to offer ( like hundreds of millions of military aid ) that he had better look into the Bidens. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, by the way).

But come on, man! Put yourself in Zelensky's shoes for a minute and ask whether it is at all possible that the message you would have received from that call was something along the lines of ""We do a lot for you. If you want us to keep doing it, you need to do this one thing for me.""

Plus, there's this: Impeachment -- which the House embarked on formally this week with the beginnings of an inquiry -- is a political process, not a legal one. Meaning that even if you buy Graham's no-quid-pro-quo argument, which you shouldn't, there is no requirement for proof that Trump said the words in order to impeach him."

""Right now, I'd like to just see us do the Ukraine issue because it is so clear and it is such a clear violation of law,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the day after the release of a stunning whistleblower complaint about Trump and his conduct.

""The President is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally. That's against the law,"" she continued.

Warren's comments come as Democrats debate how broadly to draft articles of impeachment against the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private meeting on Wednesday that she wants to focus on Trump's conversations with Ukraine, according to several sources involved in the discussions. A resolution that is more broad could make it more complicated to get the necessary votes on the House floor, according to multiple Democratic sources.

But some Democrats who backed impeachment earlier on said they want the focus of the inquiry to include findings of potential obstruction of justice, saying Trump shouldn't be let off the hook for allegedly trying to thwart former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe . Others say the inquiry should address Trump's involvement in alleged hush-money payments to prevent stories of his alleged affairs from coming out before the 2016 election.

The whistleblower complaint detailed various ways in which the whistleblower believed Trump sought to ""solicit interference"" from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, including by encouraging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Hunter Biden's past. It also laid out an alleged pattern of efforts by the White House to cover up those attempts.

The White House released a transcript of a call between Trump and Zelensky, showing Trump repeatedly pushing his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. The transcript has drawn further scrutiny because it had been moved to a highly secure server. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

""They didn't leave that transcript in the regular course of transcripts of phone calls with foreign leaders. Why? Because it wasn't a regular call,"" Warren said. ""It was a call that violated the law. And so their immediate instinct is: Let's block it out. Let's make sure nobody can see it. Let's cover it up.""

On whether she believes any Senate Republicans would vote to convict Trump, Warren answered: ""I don't know.""

""I think everyone in Congress should be called on to vote,"" she added. ""Everyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then they should have to live with that vote forever.""

Warren, who has risen in recent polls and is running neck-and-neck with Joe Biden, said she hoped the impeachment process could be wrapped up before voting in the Democratic primary begins in February. She has called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings since April after the release of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Asked whether Hunter Biden's business dealings should be off limits in the 2020 campaign, Warren pivoted back to Trump.

""I believe that this issue is about Donald Trump and that's where we need to keep our focus,"" she said. ""He is the President of the United States and he has solicited a foreign government interfering in our 2020 election. That is a threat to democracy and it is a threat to our Constitution. That's where we need to focus.""

Warren also told CNN on Friday that she worries for the safety of the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown to the public. She said Trump and his administration are ""doing their best to try to cover this up and discredit anyone who's trying to get to the truth.""

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint and defended the whistleblower, saying the whistleblower ""did the right thing.""

While governors play no official role in an impeachment process, Scott's support for an inquiry joins a surging number of House Democrats who have come out in support for the politically divisive escalation in recent days as scrutiny over Trump's interactions with Ukraine has grown.

The controversy centers around a whistleblower complaint -- which was released publicly earlier Thursday -- that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up.

Specifically, Trump said that, ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" alleging that they received a ""payoff"" worth billions. Trump said that while he hasn't yet asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to look into the Bidens, he will start ""thinking about it.""

On Thursday, CNN reported that in a June call with Xi, Trump raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

In attacking the Bidens over the past few weeks, Trump has spent the majority of his time focusing on Ukraine , but he's also at times made vague allegations about the Bidens' ties to China. On several occasions, he has intimated that the Bidens have received millions of dollars from China, implying they capitalized on the then vice president's political power and connections.

We've already fact-checked the President's claims about the Bidens and Ukraine. Trump's latest allegations involving China are similarly misleading.

Facts First: There is no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden received money from China. Though when it comes to Biden's son Hunter, Trump's allegations are not thoroughly unfounded.

Here's what Trump has said:

During his remarks at the United Nations on September 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said, ""When Biden's son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can't get money out of China, and he's there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing."" Details on the deal that the President cited come from conservative author Peter Schweizer's newest book ""Secret Empires.""

A day later, in an exchange with reporters on September 26, Trump implicated the elder Biden in his allegations, saying, ""But Adam Schiff doesn't talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and then millions of dollars from China. Walking away, in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars.""

Here's what we know:

A company, whose board Hunter Biden sat on, received a large investment of Chinese capital shortly after Hunter Biden visited the country with his father.

According to the New York Times , Biden's son Hunter has a 10% interest in BHR Partners, a private-equity fund that the Chinese government-owned Bank of China has invested in. As of May 2019, both The New York Times and the Washington Post reported that Hunter had not received any money from the fund or in connection with his role as an unpaid advisory board member.

In July 2019, more than two years after his father left office, Hunter purchased an equity stake in the BHR fund, valued around $430,000, according to the Washington Post

After Trump's meeting with Zelensky at the United Nations, one of Hunter's lawyers told the Washington Post that, ""To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors.""

The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden's role with BHR.""

In December 2013, the same month the fund was officially established , Hunter joined his father and one of his daughters on a trip to China. There, Hunter met up with Jonathan Li, the fund's China-based partner. The New Yorker reported that Li met Hunter at his hotel and shook hands with the vice president. Days after the start of the trip, Hunter had officially joined BHR's board, the Washington Post reports , raising questions about whether he had used his father's access for his own personal benefit.

However, according to The New Yorker, Hunter maintains that visit with Li was social, not business-related.

Schweizer, who also wrote ""Clinton Cash,"" suggested in a May op-ed for the New York Post that the vice president was responsible for or helped influence what he claimed in ""Secret Empires"" was a $1.5 billion deal the fund made with the Bank of China, which was signed shortly after the Bidens' trip to China.

While Schweizer points to that handshake between Biden and Li as evidence that Hunter profited from his father's position, technically that's untrue as Hunter did not personally make any money until years after his father was no longer serving as vice president.

When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" if he believed Giuliani was potentially criminally liable, Schiff said that ""If Mr. Giuliani was involved in a scheme to coerce a foreign government into giving dirt, manufacturing dirt, on President Trump's political opponent, then yes, that certainly can violate the law -- violate the criminal laws.""

""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No.""

The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to. The fact that they would so cavalierly dismiss this credible evidence and say it is not even worthy of us looking into is yet another affirmation that Attorney General Bill Barr believes that he exists to serve the will and interest of the President, not the presidency, and that's exactly what he's doing.""

Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a whistleblower complaint that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

As acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House panel on Thursday, many congressional Republicans told CNN that they hadn't yet read the complaint, which was released to the public earlier in the day.

(CNN) To understand the true meaning of what President Donald Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in their phone conversation in July, it is important to remember that the President speaks in code.

His longtime former lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress last February that Mr. Trump had never explicitly asked him to lie. ""He doesn't give you questions, he doesn't give you orders,"" Cohen said. ""He speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I've been around him for a decade...""

The account of the half-hour conversation that the White House released on Wednesday suggests that the Ukrainian President understood the code as well. American politicians who raise enormous sums for their campaigns without explicitly promising donors an illegal ""quid pro quo,"" are also fluent in the unspoken language of their trade.

If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is serious about pursuing an impeachment case against Trump, she will have to employ expert witnesses who can translate Trump's code into plain English. She will have no problem finding them on Capitol Hill.

Prosecutors do this all the time to help jurors understand what's really going on in wiretapped conversations between seasoned and wary gangsters. Any fan of ""The Sopranos"" would know that someone who has been ""clipped, whacked , erased, iced or hit,"" has been murdered.

If Pelosi hopes to prove Trump did anything impeachable on the call, a careful deconstruction of his words will be required, beginning with the transcript memo released by the White House. The President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quite helpfully provided a definition of the crime of bribery in two fiery encounters on cable news with CNN's Chris Cuomo and Fox's Laura Ingraham earlier this week. ""The crime of bribery is if I offer something of value to someone in return for their official action,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo.

He expanded on this for Fox's Laura Ingraham: ""The crime of bribery is defined in the Ukraine, as well as all of the world, as the following: You cannot offer something of value in exchange for official action.""

Unfortunately for Giuliani, this appears to be exactly what the President did.

The White House's ""memorandum"" begins innocently enough, with Trump congratulating the Ukrainian President on his recent electoral victory. Zelensky then fawns over Trump. He notes that he copied Trump campaign themes such as ""draining the swamp"" and compliments Trump as ""... a great teacher for us...""

Trump then reminds Zelensky that: ""Well it's very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.""

Trump then trash-talks German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying that ""...she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything.""

Next, he bashes other European countries in general (""they should be helping you more than they are""), reminding Zelensky once more ""but the United States has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal because things are happening that are not good, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

He follows with the barely coded language: ""we've supported you, unlike Germany and the Europeans."" And then there is the strange language about reciprocity, about the fact that ""things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""

Zelensky now sounds worried. He may not be a student of Trump's political road show rallies and is probably having trouble following Trump's meandering stream of consciousness. Given what Trump has just said in the conversation, Zelensky could well be thinking: What is he talking about? What have we not been cooperative (reciprocal) about? Is Trump considering a permanent cut-off of American aid and support?

A nervous Zelensky replies, reaffirming Ukrainian support and cooperation with the US, including support for US sanctions against Russia and even a Ukrainian decision to buy ""more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.""

Sensing weakness, Trump now follows with the ""ask."" He opens rather explicitly: ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.""

He then makes a glancing reference to ""CrowdStrike,"" a company involved in the investigation of the hack of the DNC servers in 2016. And he follows with a request that Zelensky and Ukraine should cooperate with Rudolph Giuliani and the US attorney general, who will be calling him about getting ""to the bottom of"" whether former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's political rival, interfered in Ukrainian affairs to compel the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating a company that employed Biden's son, Hunter.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,"" Trump says, ""that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great."" (This Biden allegation has been debunked by independent fact checkers and to date there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) Nonetheless, the perpetuation of such a charge, even if false, could seriously damage Biden in a close Democratic primary race.

Trump says ""Biden has been bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""

All of this certainly looks like it fits Giuliani's own definition of bribery. President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The ""stick"" or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.

This kind of case is difficult, but provable, with a careful and fair congressional investigation developing corroborative evidence."

Andy Biggs (R-AZ) on Friday introduced a motion to condemn and censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) for performing a fabricated conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his opening statement at a panel hearing Thursday morning.

“During yesterday’s hearing, Chairman Schiff’s opening statement included a blatantly false retelling of President Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Democrats previously initiated an impeachment inquiry, which leads to one of the most serious, constitutional duties of Members of Congress: removal of the President of the United States,” Biggs, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “Through this process, if the President has committed high crimes or misdemeanors, Congress may overturn the election of the President and the will of the American people. It is therefore inexcusable to toy with the process and mislead the American public with such a statement.”

Although the White House released Wednesday a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, Schiff made-up his own transcript that he read ahead of the testimony of acting DNI chief Joseph Maguire in which he accused the president of engaging in quid pro quo with the intent of exchanging U.S. military aid to Ukraine for an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

“We’ve been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don’t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from YOU though. And I’m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good,” said Schiff.

“I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it,” the congressman continued.

“And I’m gonna put you in touch with Rudy, you’re gonna love him, trust me,” Schiff said, still avoiding any real quotations from the transcript. “You know what I’m asking, so I’m only going to say this a few more times, in a few more ways. And by the way don’t call me again. I’ll call you when you’ve done what I’ve asked.”

“This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate,” he concluded.

On Friday, President Trump lambasted Schiff’s performance and demanded that he resign from Congress.

“Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist,” President Trump tweeted,

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,” the president added.

“Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,” he added. “He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

Although House Democrats claim the call — which is the subject of a partisan CIA officer’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint— shows a clear attempt by President Trump to invite Ukraine to meddle in U.S. affairs, Zelensky himself has dismissed their assertations, saying he never felt pressed by the president to investigate the Bidens.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky, flanked by the president, told reporters at the United Nations in New York City.

Nonetheless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), under pressure from progressive Democrats, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the call on Wednesday. Though House Democrats might be racing towards impeachment, the complaint-maker and his claims have already raised major red flags."

Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as he has also done in the past.

""Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn't exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,"" Trump wrote. ""Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!""

We can't endorse Trump's claim that Schiff ""lied,"" since Schiff introduced his comments at Thursday's committee hearing by saying he would be outlining ""the essence of what the president communicates,"" not providing ""the exact transcribed version of the call."" And it's important to note that we do not even have an ""exact transcribed version"" of the call -- the rough transcript released by the White House cautions explicitly that it is ""not a verbatim transcript.""

Still, Schiff's remarks did make it easy for viewers to get confused. He did not make clear which words he was taking directly from Trump's comments in the rough transcript, which words were his own analysis, and which words were meant to be the comedic ""parody"" he later said he was intending.

At some points, Schiff's words strayed quite far from what the rough transcript showed Trump saying.

Given Schiff's prominent role at the high-profile Thursday hearing and in the Democrats' overall opposition to Trump as the party makes an impeachment push, it's worth taking a deep dive into what happened here.

What Schiff said about the call

Let's go quote by quote through the relevant part of Schiff's statement.

Schiff: ""President Zelensky, eager to establish himself at home as the friend of the president of the most powerful nation on earth, had at least two objectives: get a meeting with the president and get more military help. And so what happened on that call? Zelensky begins by ingratiating himself, and he tries to enlist the support of the president. He expresses his interest in meeting with the president, and says his country wants to acquire more weapons from us to defend itself.""

Analysis: This is an accurate summary. Zelensky complimented Trump, saying he had used ""quite a few of your skills and knowledge"" in his winning election campaign; urged Trump to ""call me more often"" and (later in the call) to visit Ukraine; and said Ukraine is ""almost ready"" to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States.

Schiff: ""And what is the President's response? Well, it reads like a classic organized crime shakedown.""

Analysis: This is a subjective matter of opinion.

Schiff: ""Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the President communicates. We've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here.""

Analysis: Schiff shifted here from his own voice to the voice of Trump. But this is a roughly accurate summary of what Trump said, though Schiff used slightly different words.

Trump said in the call, ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are."" Trump then said of the US-Ukraine relationship: ""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.""

Schiff: ""I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. And I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.""

Analysis: Here's where Schiff veered quite a distance from what the rough transcript says.

Trump did not repeat a demand related to a political opponent ""seven times,"" according to the rough transcript. He told Zelensky three times that he would get his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to call Zelensky. He twice mentioned Biden's effort to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, saying this is what he wanted Zelensky to look into. (The prosecutor was widely criticized for failing to prosecute corruption, and there is no evidence of Biden wrongdoing

Trump said in the call, ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" nearly identical to Schiff's version. But the next thing Trump said was not about Biden -- it was that he wanted Zelensky to look into something related to cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and ""the server,"" possibly referring to Democratic National Committee computers hacked by Russia in 2016.

Trump was alluding to a conspiracy theory; we explain here

Trump also did not tell Zelensky to ""make up dirt"" on Biden. Rather, Trump said in the call: ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me.""

As we have previously noted , Trump was himself inaccurate here: Biden has not boasted about having ""stopped the prosecution"" of a Ukrainian case in which his son Hunter Biden had an interest.

But Trump asked Zelensky in the call to ""look into"" his baseless claim about Biden, not to make things up.

Schiff's subtext

Schiff's team argues that there was a subtext here -- that asking Zelensky to dig into Biden was effectively asking him to ""make up dirt,"" since there is not actual Biden wrongdoing to be found.

Schiff: ""I'm going to put you in touch with people, and not just any people. I'm going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr. He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I'm going to put you in touch with Rudy.""

Analysis: Trump did tell Zelensky that he would have Giuliani and the attorney general, William Barr, call him.

Trump did not tell Zelensky that Barr has ""the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him,"" but this is obviously true of the attorney general.

Schiff: ""You're going to love him (Giuliani). Trust me. You know what I'm asking? And so I'm only going to say this a few more times in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked.""

Analysis: Trump did not tell Zelensky not to call him again until he had done what Trump asked, nor did he say ""you know what I'm asking?"" The call ended on a positive note, with Trump saying of Zelensky's request for a visit to Ukraine, ""Okay, we can work that out,"" then adding, ""I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.""

The whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump instructed Vice President Mike Pence to call off a planned trip to Ukraine, and alleges that it had been ""made clear"" to US officials that ""the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelensky until he saw how Zelensky 'chose to act' in office.""

Schiff: ""This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine. It would be funny if it wasn't such a graphic betrayal of the President's oath of office. But as it does represent a real betrayal, there's nothing the president says here that is in America's interest after all.""

Analysis: This concluding quote may have further confused viewers. Schiff suggested here that he had just provided listeners with what ""the president says,"" though he had added in things that Trump did not actually say.

A 'parody'?

Later in the hearing, Republican Rep. Mike Turner criticized Schiff's comments, saying that ""sometimes fiction is better than the actual words or the text.""

""But luckily the American public are smart,"" Turner said. ""They have the transcript. They've read the conversation. They know when someone's just making it up.""

Schiff responded by saying that his summary of Trump's call was ""meant to be at least part in parody,"" a claim Trump's campaign also criticized . Schiff had not clearly distinguished the serious parts of his analysis from the supposed ""parody.""

Schiff's post-hearing response

Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday whether he regretted saying what he did, Schiff said, ""No, I think everyone understood -- and my GOP colleagues may feign otherwise. But when I said, suggested, that it was as if the President said, 'Listen carefully, because I'm only gonna tell you seven more times' -- that I was mocking the President's conduct.""

Schiff continued to stand by the comments on Friday morning.

""It was entirely clear in context of Chairman Schiff's opening statement that he was not misleading anyone. He began that portion of his statement by saying, 'In essence, what the President Trump communicates is this,' and then proceeded to describe, accurately, the message the President communicated on the call,"" Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland said in an email.

Boland added: ""When his Republican colleagues suggested they had been confused about that portion, he clarified further that he was not reading the transcript. The suggestions that he was misleading gives credence to the absurd attacks from the President and his allies in their desperate effort to distract from their wrongdoing."""

Democrats for now don't plan to make the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into potential obstruction of justice central to their impeachment push, which has been under review by the House Judiciary Committee, though Pelosi has told Democrats that the probe into those and other matters will continue.

The focus, however, will be squarely on the whistleblower allegations of wrongdoing by the President, as Democrats push to rapidly move forward on formal articles of impeachment as soon as this fall.

The decision to make the House Intelligence Committee initially take the lead provides more clarity over how Pelosi characterized the strategy earlier this week when she said the probe would be done by six committees under the ""umbrella"" of an impeachment inquiry. The initial description led to some confusion among members about how the investigation would take shape.

But Democratic leadership aides say that the other committees will continue their investigations -- and the focus could shift back to other elements of Trump's potential wrongdoing once the Ukraine probe plays out.

Yet broadening out the probe could also lose the support of some moderate Democrats who want the focus to stay trained on the Ukraine matter. They argue that raising concerns about Trump potentially weakening the country's security is a clearer message for voters back home.

In a news conference Thursday, Pelosi said that the whistleblower complaint is within the purview of the House Intelligence Committee and the timeline for the House's impeachment inquiry will be determined by that panel's investigation.

""The focus now is on this allegation,"" Pelosi said. ""This is a coverup.""

Pelosi added, ""When the committee finishes its work, and we have the work that has already been done by other chairs, there will be some determinations about how we proceed. But, I'm not going to go into that today.""

Democrats have zeroed in on a July 25 phone call , in which Trump pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Trump has said that the call was appropriate. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

A whistleblower's complaint released Thursday states that several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the Trump-Zelensky phone call and tried to ""lock down"" all records of it, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.

Democrats have spent months on the President's potential obstruction of justice from Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the allegations raised in the past week have motivated Pelosi to support an impeachment inquiry, removing the strongest impediment to Democrats in the House writing articles of impeachment.

The process is now expected to play out like this: The House Intelligence Committee will continue with its probe but the House Judiciary Committee will vote on the articles of impeachment before the full House takes up the matter.

Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told reporters on Thursday that his panel is ""going to move as expeditiously as possible."" The whistleblower complaint, he said, would provide a ""roadmap"" for the committee's push to interview witnesses and seek document requests over the matter.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, told CNN he would hope the panel hear from ""anybody"" who was involved in moving the record of the phone call to a different electronic system used to store classified information.

House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, declined to comment when asked whether his panel would write articles of impeachment charging the President with abuse of power. But some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee told CNN they expected they would be based at least in part on a reconstruction of the call released by the White House and the whistleblower's complaint.

""I believe the Ukraine issue will be part of an article of impeachment that shows abuse of power, abuse of office, the unpatriotic behavior of this President putting his own political gain above his oath — above our country,"" said Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. ""This will definitely be an important article of impeachment.""

""I think abuse of power is going to be a central part of the articles of impeachment,"" added Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida. ""And that's on full display in the Intelligence Committee hearing this morning.""

The intelligence community inspector general deemed the whistleblower's complaint to be ""credible and urgent,"" a conclusion that set in motion acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's appearance before Congress on Thursday.

Republicans pointed out that the whistleblower acknowledges in the complaint that he or she was not a ""was not a direct witness to most of the events described.""

""I think today was a circus that shouldn't have taken place,"" said Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican. ""I think the transcript speaks for itself. It's the best evidence of what happened, not a third-hand account from a whistleblower who wasn't there.""

""Nowhere in there did I see the words 'have to,' 'must,' 'will,' — anything that exerted the kind of undue influence that the Democrats promised was going to be in there,"" Ratcliffe added.

Democrats noted that the whistleblower cited ""more than half a dozen US officials"" in the complaint and was deemed ""credible"" by the intelligence community inspector general.

""At the end of the day, what is alleged in this whistleblower complaint goes to the very heart of the President's oath of office,"" Schiff said.

On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House would launch an ""official impeachment inquiry."" Pelosi mentioned that six committees — Intelligence, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Oversight, Financial Services and Ways and Means — would investigate under the ""umbrella"" of that inquiry. But there has been some confusion among House Democrats about how the inquiry will move forward.

When asked about Pelosi's announcement Tuesday setting up the ""umbrella"" of an impeachment inquiry, one Democratic congressman granted anonymity told CNN, ""I don't know what that means exactly.""

That lack of clarity could lead to some infighting among the committees. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Oversight panel, said that his committee has jurisdiction over ""all"" federal inspectors general.

""That's an angle we can assert in terms of jurisdiction,"" said Connolly. But when asked if it would, Connolly said, ""We've got to work out who does what.""

In a private meeting with House Democrats on Thursday, Pelosi made clear that the Intelligence Committee would be the point panel on the Ukraine investigation, given its jurisdiction and the narrow focus of its probe. Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut asked Pelosi if the five other committees should pause their work, according to a source.

Pelosi said that the other panels should continue, but made it clear the Intelligence Committee was in charge — a move that could quicken the pace of the impeachment inquiry. Some Democrats hope for a vote as soon as October.

""I think we are being thorough, but I think we are moving as expeditiously as possible as well,"" said Democratic Rep. Val Demings of Florida. ""We are not wasting any time in terms of following the facts where they lead us.""

House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York speaks during a committee hearing earlier this month in Washington.

On their July call, Trump pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner was investigated by Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,"" said Trump on the call, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

Trump also said he wanted his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Bill Barr to call Zelensky.

""We will get to the bottom of it,"" Trump said. ""I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict.""

While Biden -- when he was vice president -- and other Western leaders pushed for the dismissal of Shokin over lackluster anti-corruption efforts in 2016, Trump and Giuliani have claimed without evidence that Biden demanded Shokin's firing on behalf of his son. They cite Biden's threat to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine if the country's leaders did not dismiss the prosecutor.

On August 12, a whistleblower expressed concerns to the intelligence community's inspector general Michael Atkinson about Trump's call with Zelensky. Atkinson deemed them credible and urgent and sent the complaint to Maguire.

Trump has denied that his call with Zelensky was improper. On Thursday, Trump called Schiff ""Liddle'"" and attacked other Democrats for starting ""another witch hunt"" in a tweet.

""A whistleblower with second hand information,"" asked Trump on Twitter. ""Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!"""

Forty-five years after Watergate , 20 years after Bill Clinton's shame, the mechanism of impeachment is again grinding into life in Washington. The attempt by Democrats to oust a defiant President Donald Trump seems likely, given already bitter divides, to pour even more poison into the nation's political soul than those previous two impeachment dramas.

Unlike the complicated and confusing picture of shady dealings with Russians and potential obstruction painted by special counsel Robert Mueller, the questions pending in the new showdown are clear cut -- a factor that adds to the President's political vulnerability.

Did Trump abuse his power by leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer military aid to pressure a foreign country to damage a political opponent? And did the White House then engage in an effort to cover it up?

""The President of the United States has betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security, and betrayed his oath to defend our constitution,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Thursday.

The whistleblower complaint against Trump regarding his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is a ""roadmap,"" Schiff said. The document's accusations of a cover-up opens up several key Trump allies to interrogation, such as lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, and it alludes to possible other instances where records were kept secret for political purposes.

Already, 219 House Democrats -- more than half of the 435 members -- have publicly stated support for impeachment proceedings, according to CNN's count.

The character of the Republican defense of the President is clear as well. GOP lawmakers and supporters are already seeking to discredit what appears to be strong documentary evidence of pressure by Trump on Zelensky. And the White House frames impeachment as another gross attack by Democrats on Trump, a President who they say viewed as illegitimate ever since his 2016 victory.

""What these guys are doing, Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace, and it shouldn't be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it,"" Trump said, of the constitutional process of checks and balances, in a fiery statement on the airport tarmac after returning from New York on Thursday.

Washington transformed in a matter of days

On Monday, Washington showed up to work expecting most of the week's drama to unfold around Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Yet, seemingly in the blink of an eye, life changed profoundly for the President, a Democratic House majority and Senate Republicans who could save the commander in chief.

In the weeks ahead, the story of what went on in Trump's conversations with his Ukrainian counterpart and whether he broke the law and flouted the most basic constitutional principles will be distorted in a political maelstrom.

But after a week of leaks, standoffs between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, blockbuster revelations and gambles by key power brokers, the facts of the case are beginning to emerge.

Trump stands accused of illicitly using $400 million in military aid, to coerce vulnerable Ukraine, which is fighting for its life against Vladimir Putin's Russia, into investigating his potential 2020 foe Joe Biden.

The President seemed to think he could clear himself on Wednesday by releasing a rough transcript of a call with Zelensky. But his move made everything worse. Though Republicans insisted there was no quid pro quo, the document did show Trump leaning on Zelensky and asking for a ""favor.""

In 2016, Trump was accused of knowingly profiting from a Russian election meddling scheme. If the latest accusations are borne out, he took 2020 election interference into his own hands.

The case darkened considerably with Thursday's release of a whistleblower report that the White House had sought to suppress in order to contain the worst crisis of his presidency.

The still-unknown person who wrote the report accused the President of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.""

If such activity did take place, it would be about as close to a charge of presidential abuse of power -- a potentially impeachable offense -- as it is possible to get.

In another detail that will have far reaching implications, the whistleblower alleged that the White House tried to cover up the evidence of Trump's behavior.

The report said that officials were told to take the transcript of Trump's conversation with Zelensky from the computer system in which it was stored to another classified system used for the most sensitive national security information.

The move potentially corrupted a repository supposed to be used only for the nation's most sensitive secrets with material being protected for a purely political purpose.

""This is a coverup,"" said Pelosi, a California Democrat.

A road map

Democrats believe they now have a ""roadmap"" for the impeachment process announced by Pelosi on Wednesday after months of trying to hold back the liberal tide.

Her long-held reluctance to go this far may have strengthened the Democratic hand, since they can now argue that fresh evidence of lawlessness, not the disputed account of events provided by Mueller, forced their hands.

Pelosi on Thursday gave Schiff's Intelligence Committee the lead role in the impeachment inquiry.

Schiff's first move was to release the whistleblower complaint right before a hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who Democrats accused of holding back the complaint from Congress.

The whistleblower complaint, Schiff said, would provide a ""roadmap"" for the committee's push to interview witnesses and seek document requests over the matter.

During the hearing, Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander, said that both the whistleblower and the inspector general of the intelligence community who deemed the complaint ""urgent and credible"" had at all times followed the law.

The White House, initially stung by the sudden turn of events, is preparing a scorched earth defense.

""We see many Democrats who spent the last two and a half years on baseless accusations and they keep trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last presidential election,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday.

Later, it emerged that Trump directly targeted the whistleblower with a veiled hint of violence while addressing US diplomats at the United Nations.

""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy,"" Trump said, according to an audio recording released by the Los Angeles Times. ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.""

Biden weighs in

Biden responded to the President with his most combative comments of a saga that plays into his central campaign theme that Trump is unfit for office.

But Trump's claims that Biden and his son Hunter are guilty of corruption in Ukraine and China -- for which there is no evidence -- also threaten to emerge as a distraction for the former vice president.

At a fundraiser in California, Biden claimed Trump was trying to ""hijack an election.""

""He'd like to get foreign help to win elections,"" Biden said.

But Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway argued that the President was entirely within his rights to ask a foreign counterpart to investigate corruption -- borrowing the White House' s explanation for the call between Zelensky and the US leader.

""Having one President ask another President to help the enforcement of laws in alleged wrongdoing,"" Conaway said, ""is actually appropriate."""

Why does that matter if the whistleblower information was second-hand if the allegations are true, he was asked.

(CNN) Here's a secret about authoritarian-minded leaders like President Donald Trump: They are their own best friends (they usually have few real friends), and they are their own worst enemies, especially when things are not going well for them.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat

This is Trump's current situation. Revelations that he tried to get Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden have led to the House Democratic leadership to announce the start of an impeachment inquiry. Trump has reacted predictably . ""Another Witch Hunt!"" reads one of a flood of Tweets on the subject.

Yet Trump has brought this situation on himself by demanding that Americans, including those who work in the White House and in the federal government, accept his autocratic personal style of governance, scorn for the rule of law and insatiable need for loyalty to him over duty to country. For at least some in the government — like the whistleblower and the intelligence community's inspector general — Trump's actions warranted sounding an alarm.

This is a predictable outcome for a leader who has been following the authoritarian playbook from the start. Authoritarians view public office in an entirely proprietary manner: It is their vehicle for power and enrichment for them and their family. National security, economic policy, and foreign relations must be subordinated to their personal agendas. In Trump's case, his agenda is a combination of making profits for the Trump Organization — for example by allegedly pressuring the US Air Force crews to stay at his Turnberry resort in Scotland during refueling stops (something Trump has said he knows nothing about) — and fending off anything and anyone that might threaten the consolidation of his power. This includes Biden, a man he evidently feels might take him out of office in 2020.

Leaders like Trump behave in predictable ways and follow foreseeable patterns as they use public office to further their private goals. First, they need co-conspirators: an inner sanctum of loyalists who will do their bidding and keep their secrets. This is why they often hire their own family members and why they fire so many other people — it can take a while to find the right individuals to infringe democratic norms for them. Trump now has the man he calls ""my attorney general,"" William Barr, who gave misleading information about the Mueller report to protect his boss and is cited repeatedly in the whistleblower's report as being involved (along with Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani) in the request for a favor from the Ukrainian leader, although the Justice Department released a statement denying that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians."

The panel is in negotiations to interview the whistleblower who wrote in August an extraordinary complaint to intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson alleging that Trump asked Ukraine's President to initiate an investigation that could have benefited his reelection. Senior White House officials then endeavored to conceal records of the call including the official transcript, according to the complaint.

Schiff told CNN on Friday the committee expects a hearing as soon as next week, while the rest of Congress will be back in their districts for a two-week recess. The panel will hold another closed briefing with Atkinson on October 4, according to a source on the House Intelligence committee.

""We will move as expeditiously as possible,"" said Schiff. ""But we have to see what witnesses are going to make themselves available and what witnesses are going to require compulsion.""

If the White House stonewalls the investigation, he added, ""It'll just strengthen the case on obstruction,"" an impeachable offense. The panel and House Oversight consulted with the House Foreign Affairs committee to subpoena Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday over his failure to produce documents related to Ukraine.

Once it has exhausted its options — either by getting information or if the White House blocks its investigation — Democrats may move forward with articles of impeachment, potentially over obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.

It is unclear whether Schiff will invite other witnesses to come before his panel, but Democratic lawmakers on it would like to hear from people mentioned in the whistleblower's complaint, including Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and Attorney General Bill Barr.

""The discussions are underway between the relevant parties representing the whistleblower and others to see if that's an opportunity that can be afforded to us,"" Rep. Denny Heck, Democrat of Washington, told CNN. ""My view is the sooner the better. I would hope that that would happen within the next two weeks.""

""I would like next to talk to the whistleblower,"" he added.

House Democrats are hoping for a speedy process, aiming to potentially move forward with impeachment by Thanksgiving. While the Intelligence Committee continues its investigation over the October recess, the House Judiciary Committee is likely to begin sifting through existing evidence and considering a path forward for articles of impeachment, members say.

""I think members of the Judiciary Committee are going to be conferring with each other and thinking about some of the legal frameworks and some of the evidence that we've collected already, and what that supports in terms of articles of impeachment that we may or may not recommend to the full House,"" Rep. David Cicilline told CNN on Friday.

It remains a key unanswered question what articles of impeachment could look like — it depends on the Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation -- but Democrats are largely agreed on the focus for now. The Ukraine matter, Cicilline said, ""has to be the centerpiece of any impeachment proceedings.""

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, speaks at the Capitol in Washington earlier this week.

On a July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner was investigated by Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Shokin. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,"" said Trump on the call, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

Trump also said he wanted his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Bill Barr to call Zelensky.

On August 12, a whistleblower expressed concerns to the intelligence community's inspector general Michael Atkinson about Trump's call with Zelensky. Atkinson deemed them credible and urgent and sent the complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The complaint was released ahead of Maguire's testimony Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

Reps. Eric Swalwell and Jackie Speier, California Democrats on the Intelligence committee, told CNN they have canceled events in their districts next week to prepare for potential action on the panel.

Speier told CNN she had a number of questions for the whistleblower, including whether he or she has additional information regarding other phone calls or circumstances ""in which there's been a quid pro quo kind of environment.""

""I want to know who else was privy to this information and didn't speak up,"" Speier said. ""We all take an oath of office when we become federal officials, and many of those people in the White House are federal officials.""

""There were gross violations of law and yet, he or she is the only person who came forward,"" she added.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said both Giuliani and Barr are ""obviously central figures"" in the complaint but that he would defer to Schiff on whether to invite them before the committee.

""I'm not too worried that, if we call Rudy Giuliani for a hearing that he wouldn't show up,"" added Krishnamoorthi.

The president from TV

Trauma seemed to spread across the face of Ukraine's President during his meeting with Trump -- just after the US President suggested he work more with Vladimir Putin , who invaded Ukraine and claimed a chunk five years ago.

The bullied ex-Soviet republic is desperate for America's help, but its hopes for Western assistance to a better future often flounder in the No Man's Land of post-Cold War relations. Now, Trump is suspected of temporarily holding up $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, while asking for a political favor. The sum would have been a drop in the bucket for America and the billionaire President, who requested $639 billion in defense spending for 2018. But for Ukraine it was a lifeline to counter Russian aggression.

No wonder Zelensky so obsequiously flattered Trump in their notorious July 25 phone call, which one Democrat dubbed a ""classic mob shakedown."" Trump says there was ""no quid pro quo,"" but even if that's the case, his request for an investigation into Joe Biden must have been an agonizing moment for the rookie President, who ran on an anti-corruption platform and whose only experience before being elected was playing a president on TV.

As they met before reporters here in New York, Trump treated Zelensky as a defense witness, making sure it was clear that he said he hadn't been pressured go after Biden. He also couldn't resist pointing out that Russia's annexation of Crimea fell on Barack Obama's watch, and that a Ukrainian won the Miss Universe pageant when he owned it. The contrast between Trump's parochial and personal concerns and Ukraine's existential angst was stark. It's no laughing matter for Zelensky and the heads of other states looking to the United States for geopolitical support.

""The server, they say Ukraine has it""

Also revealed in the transcript of Trump's call was his request that Kiev ""find out what happened"" with a company called Crowdstrike and ""the server."" What Trump means is not clear, but references to a missing server are common among some US political conspiracy theorists. In brief:

Crowdstrike is a publicly traded US cybersecurity firm that has been hired by Democrats and Republicans. In 2016, it was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate a hack into DNC servers.

CrowdStrike concluded that Russia had engineered the cyberattack, and US special counsel Robert Mueller later confirmed this.

Trump has rejected the notion that Russia was responsible, and asked why the DNC hired Crowdstrike to investigate instead of directly giving its servers to the FBI.

No particular DNC server has been publicly identified as missing, particularly suspicious, or in Ukraine.

Adam Schiff (D-CA), speculated Fred Fleitz , president and CEO of the Center for Security Policy and a former member of the intelligence community.

Fleitz — who served as deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council — has previously held national-security jobs with the CIA, the DIA, the Department of State, and the House Intelligence Committee staff. He offered his analysis of the “whistleblower” complaint during a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Colin Madine.

Fleitz reflected on Thursday’s hearing before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Schiff, with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony. The hearing ostensibly sought to investigate a “whistleblower” complaint released to Congress and the public regarding President Donald Trump’s July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Let’s start with how strange this hearing was today,” began Fleitz. “We had the director of national intelligence before the committee. He couldn’t answer the questions because they were all about policy. You see, this is not an intelligence matter. The president is a part of the intelligence community, and intelligence officers can’t lodge complaints with their inspector general because they don’t agree with the president’s policies, but that’s what happened here.”

In a Thursday-published op-ed in the New York Post, Fleitz wrote, “It appears likely to me that this so-called whistleblower was pursuing a political agenda.”

LISTEN:

Fleitz continued, “Concerning the complaint, it looked like it was written by a team of attorneys. I was an intelligence analyst for 19 years. We don’t write that way. We see the very detailed legal footnotes to this. This, I think, was a setup job that included others, probably attorneys with the House Intelligence Committee.”

“Adam Schiff was talking and tweeting about the president meddling in Ukraine and leveraging aid to Ukraine to hurt the Bidens in August before this appeared, and lo and behold. this complaint happens to be filed so it will hit his committee,” added Fleitz. “I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”

Trump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent. It doesn’t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security. https://t.co/X4yhTS2q1Z — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) August 29, 2019

Mansour asked, “One of the accusations that they kept going after is that this conversation, this phone call, the transcript of it, was placed in some super secret special secure file database, and that shows that they were trying to keep this secret. What did you make of that?”

Fleitz replied, “As executive secretary of the NSC, I edited and processed transcripts of presidential phone calls with foreign leaders, and there’s a very secure area of the computer system where these are places. [The accusation], I think, is false, absolutely false, because I already know there’s a secure place to put this stuff. The allegation was, to protect this stuff, they were putting it into an intelligence computer system controlled by the CIA. That doesn’t make any sense. Why would the White House store something sensitive in a CIA computer system? It’s ridiculous. I just think the person who said this made it up.”

Fleitz explained protocol for documenting presidential phone calls with foreign leaders. “These phone calls are listened to and transcribed by intelligence officers in the White House Situation Room, and there may be an intelligence officer and a regional officer — like the Europe-Russia office that may also see it — and I would have seen it as the executive secretary. Anyone who works on these or has access has to control them very strictly and not tell anyone about them who’s not on the dissemination list.”

“If you read this complaint, it’s pretty clear,” Fleitz stated. “This person wasn’t on the dissemination list. People were talking to him about the complaint, even though he did not have the need to know or the right to know about this document. That said, people aren’t following the rules. … Extremely sensitive material is supposed to be kept confidential. They’re violating the president’s trust.”

Fleitz remarked, “There’s no question the president didn’t do anything illegal or anything required to be reported or anything that was impeachable. … If this whistleblower really thought that something had been done wrong by the president, he could have gone to the Foreign Affairs Committees, to the defense committees, the government oversight committees, but he can’t go to the intelligence committee because it’s not an intelligence matter, but it had been made one so Adam Schiff could handle it. Schiff was trying to argue any complaint submitted to the [intelligence community] inspector general has to be reported to Congress and is considered serious. What if the complaint doesn’t belong with the intelligence community inspector general, like this one? What I would’ve done if I was [inspector general], I’d say, ‘Well, you can’t bring this to us. You’re going to have to bring this to someone on the Hill, because this doesn’t involve an intelligence equity.’”

“If this is so serious, you should be prepared to stand behind it,” said Fleitz of the “whistleblower,” adding, “if you get fired for it, you’re standing on your honor. But we know very well that if this person was fired, he’ll be hired immediately by MSNBC. So this is not going to be a career-ending incident. This is political, 100 percent, and as I said, I think the House Intelligence Committee Democrat lawyers are deeply involved in it.”

“I think he’s a rogue intelligence officer,” said Fleitz of the bureaucrat who filed the aforementioned complaint, “and I’d say further, he is a rogue intelligence officer who is politicizing intelligence to destroy the president.”

Fleitz went on, “It just seems like the Democrats are going to stop at nothing to get this president out of office before the next election. The Russia collusion turned out to be a fraud, so they cooked this up. I heard Catherine Herridge say on Fox, ‘This seems to be a very well-written complaint,’ and I thought to myself, ‘Uh oh.’ Usually whistleblower complaints are not well-written. They’re written by people who are a little bit paranoid. They don’t want to consult with other people, but this was written by a team of people. I have no doubt of that, and I’m just thinking if this doesn’t work, they’re going to come up with something else.”

“There are many, many good guys [in the intelligence services],” estimated Fleitz. “The bad guys are a distinct minority. Some of them are in management. Even the vast majority of them [on the analytic side] are not political, they just want to do their jobs. I shared offices with people who were quite partisan Democrats who didn’t like President Reagan or really liked President Clinton, and they never let their politics get into their work, and that’s still the way it goes today.”

Fleitz determined, “It seems pretty clear to me that Adam Schiff and the Intelligence Committee Democrats knew about this. That makes me think that attorneys with that committee were working with this person or they directed him maybe to an outside attorney or to an outside expert who could help draft it, but I think the Schiff angle is very important, because things he said in August almost exactly match this whistleblowing complaint. That’s not a coincidence.”

“[Adam Schiff] sent out a tweet on the 28th of August which faulted President Trump for withholding military aid from Ukraine to harm Joe and Hunter Biden,” recalled Fleitz. “I mean, come on. This is two weeks before this whistleblowing complaint shows up making the same allegation, and it comes to his committee? Think about it. … Because it happened to be Adam Schiff, and this unusual request that shouldn’t have been in the intelligence sphere came into the intelligence sphere, forcing it into his committee, it’s just too many coincidences to be believed.”

.2/ Its pretty clear from the Washington Post story that someone knew the details of this complaint who is hostile to @realDonaldTrump and leaked it to the press. My guess is this leak came from House Democrats who have been heavily involved in orchestrating this complaint. — Fred Fleitz (@FredFleitz) September 26, 2019

“I think that by bringing this up, the Democrats are hurting Joe Biden, because a lot of Americans are wondering why was Hunter Biden getting $50,000 a month from the Ukrainians,” assessed Fleitz. “I told that to an Israeli official — I was at a reception with him, recently — he said to me, ‘Well, that sounds like a bribe.’ I said, ‘No, they’re buying influence.’ He said, ‘No, in Israel, that’s a bribe.’”

Fleitz concluded, “I think this is going to backfire [on Democrats].”

The hunt is on to find an implied bribe or threat because Trump did not offer one explicitly.

The much-discussed phone call did not include an exchange where Trump said he would only release temporarily frozen military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky agreed to investigate the unusual and highly lucrative relationship between a Ukrainian firm and Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Media attention therefore shifted to the timing of President Trump’s order to freeze some $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine. The idea was to demonstrate an implicit threat and assert Trump only put a hold on the funds to pressure Zelensky into investigating the Bidens.

Both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have said there were concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the administration wanted reassurances that Zelensky – the new 41-year-old Ukrainian leader, a political neophyte and professional comedian who was scarcely taken seriously as a candidate at the outset but was handed a commanding victory by a scandal-fatigued electorate – was up to the challenge of implementing reforms.

President Trump said at the United Nations on Tuesday that he also withheld the funds because he wanted to pressure the Europeans to contribute more:

As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I’d withhold again, and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because they’re not doing it. Just the United States. We’re putting up the bulk of the money. And I’m asking, why is that?

This prompted a flurry of “fact-checking” pieces alleging Trump was lying about the relative contributions of the United States and Europe to Ukraine, in an effort to create a post hoc rationalization for withholding the funds before Democrats can impeach him for using the $391 million to blackmail Zelensky into sabotaging Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.

One big problem with this analysis is Trump did not invent the “withhold to make the Europeans pay more” on Tuesday. He complained about inadequate European contributions to Zelensky during their July 25 conversation, and Zelensky agreed with him.

“We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time, much more than the European countries are doing, and they should be helping you more than they are,” Trump told Zelensky.

“Germany does almost nothing for you,” he continued. “All they do is talk, and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way, so I think it’s something you want to look at, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.”

“Yes, you are absolutely right,” Zelensky replied. “Not only one hundred percent, but actually one thousand percent, and I can tell you the following: I did talk with Angela Merkel and I did meet with her.”

“I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine,” he added, referring to French President Emmanuel Macron.

“It turns out that even though logically the European Union should be our biggest partner, but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union, and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine – much more than the European Union, especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation,” Zelensky said.

“I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense,” he told Trump. “We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.”

The fact-checkers excoriating Trump (and, by extension, Zelensky) for underselling European support for Ukraine are missing the fact that they were clearly talking about military support, along with sanctions against Russia. They are also leaving out some very important context for why Trump and Zelensky think Europe isn’t doing enough for Ukraine, including the highly controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, a major threat to Ukraine’s economic independence.

As the New York Times pointed out on Monday, the aid for Ukraine blocked by Trump was military in nature – a major reason Trump’s hold on the funds caused such consternation at the time, because Ukraine gets far more military support from the U.S. than Europe. The aid in question consisted of $250 million from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative at the Defense Department plus $141 million from the State Department’s program for foreign military aid.

A Politico report from late August – when Trump’s critics were insinuating he froze Ukrainian military aid to curry favor with Moscow and wheedle Russia back into the G7 – quoted a senior administration official saying Trump wanted to “ensure U.S. interests are being prioritized when it comes to foreign assistance.”

This official said the president also sought assurances that other countries were “paying their fair share” – the same thing Trump said on Monday, and the same thing he told Zelensky during their phone conversation in July.

The Politico report also mentioned the long-running internal administration debate over foreign aid in general. President Trump’s complaints about the United States shouldering too much of the international foreign aid burden began long before his phone call with Zelensky.

The Obama administration refused to send any lethal aid to Ukraine at all, but Trump authorized the Javelin anti-tank missiles referred to by Zelensky during his first year in office. The aid package Trump temporarily blocked was seen as a major escalation of U.S. military aid in response to provocative actions by the Russians.

Shortly before Trump froze the aid, a U.S. News report mentioned Trump’s dissatisfaction with European contributions to Ukrainian defense, his desire to reduce U.S. contributions to a “European Reassurance Initiative” established by the Obama administration, and his criticism of Germany in particular for not contributing enough to defense projects.

As Zelensky indicated during his conversation with Trump, the Ukrainians have frequently criticized Europe, and especially Germany, for not maintaining enough pressure against Russia.

Germany’s Deutsche Welle pointed out last November that Germany has indeed refused to offer military support to Ukraine. Chancellor Angela Merkel ignored former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko’s plea for warships to provide security in the Sea of Azov after Russia seized three Ukrainian vessels.

There is also the aching sore of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Russian project that will bypass Ukraine to pump gas into Germany. Both President Trump and the Ukrainians have strongly criticized the pipeline, along with most of Eastern Europe.

“One of the important areas of our common interaction at the European level is the issue of energy security, preservation of the strategic role of the Ukrainian gas transit system and counteraction of Nord Stream 2,” Zelensky said during a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June.

The U.S. government has considered offering extensive support for Ukraine to deal with Russia knocking it out of the gas supply chain to Europe, a cost that should reasonably be added to any discussion of how much the U.S. is contributing to Ukraine’s defense against Russia.

Trump and Zelensky’s take on the contributions of Europe and especially Germany could be judged as harsh. Germany’s Chancellor Merkel is often credited with exercising great diplomatic skill with Russia on Ukraine’s behalf. Then again, with Ukrainians still dying in Donbas, the new chief executive in Kyiv could be forgiven for wondering just how much Merkel’s diplomacy is worth. There is ample evidence that such thoughts were passing through both Trump and Zelensky’s minds in June when they had their fateful phone conversation."

""I believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law,"" said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , testifying before a key House committee.

But Maguire declined to say whether he spoke to the President about the whistleblower complaint that alleged that Trump solicited the help of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and that White House officials tried to hide his conduct, in the latest twist of a fast-escalating drama that has turned into the most serious crisis of Trump's presidency.

""I am not partisan and I am not political,"" said Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander who served eight presidents in uniform and was not a well-known public figure until he was thrust into the glare of the scandal.

Democrats used the high profile forum to accuse the President of abusing his power and endangering national security. Republicans tried to pick holes in the complaint, noting that the unidentified whistleblower admitted not having first-hand knowledge of events including Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky

Under intense pressure from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Maguire also acknowledged that his office consulted with the White House counsel's office after receiving a complaint detailing allegations about Trump's communications with Ukraine , because calls with foreign leaders usually fall under executive privilege.

Maguire had been accused before the hearing of caving into White House pressure not to follow the law and turn over a complaint that the intelligence community's inspector general deemed ""urgent and credible.""

The acting DNI repeatedly defended his handling of the complaint, telling lawmakers he followed the law in an ""unprecedented"" situation, despite claims to the contrary by Democrats that he infringed on their right to review the allegations.

His appearance before the committee and a closed door briefing before the Senate panel, came a day after lawmakers had their first chance to see the classified account that spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The account was declassified and released Thursday morning.

Allegations of a 'coverup'

The complaint states that several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky and tried to ""lock down"" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.

Maguire said during his testimony he did not have the authority to waive the executive privilege that covered the conversation with Ukraine's President and would not say whether he discussed the complaint with Trump.

""My conversations with the President, because I'm the director of national intelligence, are privileged, and it would be inappropriate for me, because it would destroy my relationship with the President in intelligence matters, to divulge any of my conversations with the President of the United States,"" Maguire said responding to a question from Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.

But in a tense exchange with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Maguire conceded that ""there is an allegation of a coverup.""

""But right now, all we have is an allegation — an allegation with second hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge on whether or not that is true and accurate statement,"" he said.

When asked later in the hearing if Trump asked him to disclose the identity of the whistleblower, Maguire told lawmakers,"" I can tell you emphatically, no.""

He also said no one else within the White House or DOJ asked him to identify the whistleblower.

White House consulted after complaint

Initially, Maguire seemed to waver about the chronology of events related to his handling of the complaint but ultimately told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that his office did seek guidance from the White House before raising the issue with the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice, which advised he was not legally bound to provide it to the committee.

""Such calls are typically subject to executive privilege, as a result we consulted with the White House counsel's office and were advised that much of the information of the complaint was in fact subject to executive privilege,"" Maguire said. ""A privilege that I do not have the authority to waive. Because of that we were unable to immediately share the details of the complaint with this committee.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided a redacted version to Congress that members can bring to an open hearing, a spokesperson said.

The anticipation ahead of Maguire's testimony was also amplified by the White House's decision to release a transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with the leader of Ukraine that shows the President repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is included in the whistleblower complaint, a source familiar with the situation said last week, a revelation that only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry , a move that has raised the stakes of this week's events.

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, started the hearing by accusing Trump of betraying his oath of office and compromising US national security for Trump's ""personal, political benefit,"" referring to the conduct outlined in the call transcript released Wednesday.

""It forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office: impeachment. Now this matter would not have come to the attention of our committee or the nation's attention without the courage of a single person- the whistleblower,"" he said.

GOP members question whistleblower's claim

Republicans, however, keyed in to the fact that the whistleblower acknowledged they did not have firsthand knowledge of most of the events described in the complaint.

""I was not a direct witness to most of the events described,"" the whistleblower wrote, noting that they were aware of details in the complaint pertaining to Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian President because of ""White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

But the public now has a way to test the accuracy of at least part of the whistleblower's complaint by comparing the details related to that call to the transcript released by the White House Wednesday. By all appearances, the information is consistent.

In his testimony Thursday, Maguire continued to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint , saying he was told by the Department of Justice it did ""not meet the statutory requirement of 'urgent concern,'"" required to transmit to Congress and insisted that decision was ""binding.""

""After reviewing the complaint, and the inspector general's transmittal letter, the office of legal counsel determined that the complaint's allegations do not meet the statutory requirement definition (of) legal, urgent concern, and found that I was not legally required to transmit the material to our oversight committee,"" he added.

Last week, Maguire refused to comply with a deadline to hand over a whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee that had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent,"" a conclusion that drove his push to provide Congress with the details and refer the matter to the Justice Department for consideration of criminality.

Maguire suggested during his testimony that he understood the importance of the complaint itself.

""I realized ... full and well the importance of the allegation,"" Maguire said, adding later, ""when I saw that, I anticipated having to sit in front of some committee some time to discuss it.""

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint, taken together with the transcript of President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was released earlier this week by the White House, explain why Nancy Pelosi is finally getting behind impeachment proceedings: A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.

Impeachment proceedings went ahead against President Richard Nixon because he engaged in a cover-up of a break-in at the Democratic Party office at the Watergate, of which he claimed to have no advance knowledge.

As is so often the case in Washington, it was the cover-up that rose to the level of a breach of public trust that was the grounds for impeachment proceedings against Nixon.

In Trump's case, Democrats in the House can credibly make the case that while in office Trump pressured a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent, Joe Biden, and his family. President Trump insists he did nothing wrong.

And then Trump officials, realizing that there was something unseemly about the call between Trump and the Ukrainian President made every effort, according to the whistleblower, to ""lock down"" the transcript of the call by removing the transcript from where these transcripts are generally stored and loading it on a separate computer system where only the most classified and sensitive communications are stored, despite the fact that there was no classified information in the call.

The House Intelligence Committee released a redacted version of the “whistleblower” complaint prior to Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire’s appearance before the committee.

This complaint should never have been withheld, and it provides a roadmap for our investigation. We will do everything we can to protect this courageous whistleblower. The public has a right to see the complaint and what it reveals. Read it here:https://t.co/B0DrqDt4MS — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 26, 2019

The document confirms reports that the “whistleblower” did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

As Breitbart News reported, “Allegations in the complaint seem to be distortions of exaggerations of information in the transcript itself, which the White House released Wednesday,” and continued:

For example, the whistleblower claims that Trump “praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Letsenko.” Trump appears never to have mentioned Letsenko, and his reference to a prosecutor (“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down”) was a reference to former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, on whose board Hunter Biden served, at the time Joe Biden demanded he be fired, under threat of withholding $1 billion in American aid.

The complaint also revealed that the “whistleblower” relied heavily on reporting from outlets such as the New York Times, the Hill, and ABC News, among others.

The unredacted transcript released by the White House on Wednesday showed no such “pressure” from the president, no quid pro quo, and no lawless behavior, as several GOP lawmakers pointed out. Nonetheless, numerous Democrat lawmakers are reacting to the release of the complaint, claiming that it proves the existence of a coverup, and likening the president to a mob boss.

“Mob bosses are smarter & more subtle in their threats than Trump was talking to Zelensky,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wrote:

“If Senate Republicans aren’t seriously alarmed by this whistleblower report, then something is deeply wrong,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) tweeted, falsely accusing Trump of asking a foreign power to “attack our free and fair elections”:

Rep. André Carson (D-IN) declared that the “whistleblower” complaint shows the administration’s wrongdoing and abuse “clear as day.”

“Now that the whistleblower’s complaint has been released, all Americans can see in plain view the extent of the Administration’s wrongdoing,” he tweeted.

“The White House’s attempts to hide this from Congress amounted to an illegal coverup, and show knowledge of guilt,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) concluded:

According to a White House transcript of the call, Trump asked for a ""favor"" -- help from Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 contender.

""The quid pro quo is in the President's words,"" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California argued on CNN's ""New Day"" Friday, telling John Berman that Trump's phone call with Zelensky ""makes it very clear.""

""That together with withholding the funds, which preceded the phone call. All of these things are there. And that's not circumstantial,"" Garamendi said.

CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin argued on CNN Wednesday that there's ""very strong evidence that there was a quid pro quo here"" in Trump's phone call.

Toobin pointed to the section of the White House transcript in which Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine was ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US. Trump replied, ""I would like you to do us a favor.""

""He raises that at the precise moment after Zelensky raises the issue of we need money for our defense,"" Toobin said. ""Money, favor. Quid pro quo.""

Trump on early Wednesday, after the rough transcript was released, denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky. At a separate afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo.""

The rough transcript, a senior White House official said, was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening.

Lawmakers spar over issue of quid pro quo

A majority of Republicans fell in line with the White House's argument that the call summary did not provide proof of an explicit quid pro quo.

""There is no quid pro quo, no this for that. Nowhere does the President say that he will withhold military aid unless the Ukraine investigation continues. It's simply not there,"" Republican Rep. Ross Spano of Florida, a former lawyer, argued on the House floor Wednesday.

But Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-New York, also a former lawyer who spoke after Spano, said, ""You don't need to state an explicit quid pro quo when you have conducted the quid pro quo, when you have withheld the military aid.""

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said at a news conference Wednesday that the President's call amounted to a ""classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.""

""The President of Ukraine brought up his country's need for military assistance and immediately thereafter the President of the United States said, I have a favor I want to ask of you,' and would not let the subject go. There was only one message that that president of Ukraine got from that call,"" Schiff said.

Did Trump violate law?

Federal election campaign law makes it a crime for a foreign national -- directly or indirectly -- ""to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value"" and for ""a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation...from a foreign national.""

The phone call between Trump and Zelensky was part of a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and eventually was alerted to the Justice Department.

The Justice Department determined last week that there was no reason for a full-blown finance criminal investigation. What the President asked of Zelensky doesn't amount to a quantifiable ""thing of value"" under campaign finance law, top administration officials determined

The whistleblower complaint publicly released Thursday alleges that Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up.

White House lawyers were in discussion about ""how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain,"" the complaint says.

""Looking at the document as a whole, that certainly could be implied,"" George Washington law professor John Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday. ""Whether or not it could be implied and the proof is strong enough to meet a criminal standard ... the answer is probably no. But if in a civil context where the standard is much lower ... I think the answer would be clearly yes.""

Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday that it doesn't make any difference whether there is a quid pro quo or not.

""It still arguably would violate the federal election law, and therefore would be a crime,"" Banzhaf said. He added: ""When Trump asked for this information, that by itself probably violates the statute, even if there's no quid pro quo.""

Banzhaf also noted that ""thing of value"" has been interpreted ""very, very broadly.""

""It is not just money, or a flight on an airplane, or even a data set. It's anything which may be of a value to somebody else and might persuade them to do something,"" Banzhaf said, adding later, ""Pretty certainly, information which would be damaging to a possible political opponent, which would be Biden, would meet the criteria of a 'thing of value.'""

On Wednesday, Toobin had also argued that quid pro quo isn't necessary for the call to be ""wildly inappropriate and potentially impeachable.""

""The very notion of asking a foreign leader for dirt on a political opponent, independent of the issue of quid pro quo, is troubling to many, many people,"" Toobin said on CNN.

On sale for $29 apiece, the shirts come in six different designs and feature Tlaib’s infamous 2017 call to “impeach the mother fucker!” — an expletive reference to the president.

“You’ve asked for ‘em. And now we’ve got ‘em,” Tlaib’s campaign wrote of the shirts in an email to supporters.

The Michigan Democrat took to Twitter to promote the shirts herself, writing: “Lean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable. Together, we will fight back and protect our democracy. Our country depends on it!”

The t-shirts are a play on a pledge in which Tlaib, fresh off her swearing-in to Congress, recounted a story about how she told her son that she would ensure the impeachment of President Trump.

“‘Look, Mama, you won. Bullies don’t win.’ And I said, ‘Baby, they don’t because we’re going to go in there and we’re going to impeach the mother fucker,” she told attendees of a MoveOn.org event, prompting cheers.

The freshman congresswoman’s crude comments drew awe from lawmakers and even the scorn of President Trump, who called them “disgraceful”

“This is a person I don’t know, I assume she’s new,” the president said. “I think she dishonored herself and dishonored her family using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Tlaib, one of the congressional Democrats’ most ardent supporters of impeachment, introduced a resolution to oust the president in March. In light of the Trump-Zelensky call, Tlaib accused the president of putting “the lives of Americans in jeopardy by putting his personal interests before our country that he took an oath to defend.”

“Impeachment is our only option,” she added.

And it appears that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) likely agrees. The California Democrat launched a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, citing a so-called “whistleblower’s” complaint alleging President Trump pressed Ukraine’s president to investigate Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the eastern European country.

On Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the call, in which the president mentioned possible wrongdoing by the Biden family, thoug, as Zelenksy stated later in the day, he felt no pressure whatsoever by the president to probe into the matter.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky told reporters at the United Nations in New York City.

According to the New York Times, the partisan federal employee who issued the complaint is a male CIA officer who was previously “detailed to work at the White House.”

The officer, who has since returned to work at the CIA, is believed to be an “analyst by training” and “steeped in details” of U.S. foreign policy toward Europe and to possess a “sophisticated understanding” of Ukrainian politics.

The Department of Justice on Wednesday confirmed the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found that the so-called “whistleblower” not only had second-hand information regarding the call, but also possessed a “political bias” in favor of a “political rival” of President Trump. It’s been widely reported that the officer did not hear the Trump-Zelensky call directly and relied on second-hand information to formulate his complaint."

(CNN) The intelligence community whistleblower complaint released publicly on Thursday ratchets up the pressure on President Donald Trump and his inner circle, as the Ukraine scandal explodes at a dizzying pace.

On the heels of Wednesday's release of an official summary of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the complaint gives us two major takeaways -- both making impeachment more likely.

First, every scandal needs a coverup, and now the Ukraine case has its very own. We learned that White House lawyers allegedly instructed other staffers to store records of the damning July 25 phone call on a server normally reserved for extremely sensitive classified information. Records of the Trump-Zelensky phone call ordinarily would have no business on such a server; according to the complaint, storage on the classified server was ""an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.""

Have questions on impeachment? Share them below, and we'll answer as many as we can.

As the whistleblower notes, the intent was to ""lock down"" evidence of the conversation. This move shows us that Trump's closest advisers recognized quickly that the call posed a major problem and bucked normal protocol to try to hide it. Lawyers call this ""consciousness of guilt"" -- meaning that when people try to hide evidence or influence witnesses or otherwise obstruct justice, they typically do so for a reason. This kind of proof can be devastating in court (or, in this case, eventually in the House and later the Senate).

The second big revelation is that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was so centrally involved in Trump's effort to push the Ukrainian government to dig for dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Giuliani already has spoken publicly (and inconsistently ) about his efforts to mine political dirt on Trump's political rivals, and the whistleblower complaint similarly casts him as a ""central figure"" in the illicit undertaking.

Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.

But Trump's attacks on the whistleblower's credibility simply don't fly. Trump's own appointed intelligence community inspector general formally deemed the whistleblower complaint credible . And the whistleblower in the complaint somehow managed to give a spot-on description of Trump's pivotal July 25 phone call. Trial lawyers call this corroboration -- meaning the witness is backed up by some reliable, outside evidence.

The House Intelligence Committee has a daunting and complex investigative task ahead of it. And the whistleblower complaint serves as a helpful roadmap. Speak with every relevant person referenced in the complaint. Subpoena any emails or texts relating to the effort to bury documents. Interview (and subpoena if necessary) State Department officials who may (or may not) have authorized Giuliani to conduct official business on behalf of the United States.

The evidence is piling up. Trump and his defenders are going into battle mode. We learned on Thursday that one of their primary targets for counterattack, the whistleblower, will not be easily dismissed or discredited."

(CNN) Hubris, the Greeks tell us , can be the final downfall of the mighty, especially the mighty whose most salient trait is extreme arrogance.

Which brings us to this moment in history, and to President Donald Trump, who is now facing a formal impeachment inquiry after spending the first half of his presidency successfully trying to avoid one.

How to explain the President's behavior? How is it possible that after the country was torn apart by the Russian interference in the 2016 election and its aftermath, and after Trump himself endured almost two years under the searing spotlight of an investigation into that very thing, how is it possible that he could reach out to another country and -- according to a whistleblower complaint -- attempt another round of election interference? How is that possible?

Yes, the President and his supporters deny that's what he was doing. I suggest we all read the White House memo reconstructing the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the now-declassified whistleblower complaint and see what we think it indicates.

Zelensky, sitting on Wednesday next to Trump, the world's most powerful man, pleaded "" I'm sorry, but I don't want to be involved"" in the US election, adding ""I think and you read (in the transcript) that nobody pushed me.""

If Trump did demand that Zelensky launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a top challenger in the 2020 elections -- as appears evident from the White House transcript -- it would constitute a display of hubris worthy of Euripides.

Trump himself perfectly encapsulated the depths of his hubristic delusion when he famously declared ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters."" He just may be engaged in a metaphorical test of that theory.

Trump may survive the impeachment process because Republicans in the Senate have shown little inclination to defy him. But if he does fall, it will be in large part because he has believed the oleaginous praise he demanded. He bought his own over-the-top marketing campaign about himself.

Who can forget those nearly unwatchable televised early Cabinet meetings, where normally-dignified figures went around the table singing his praises, describing the ""incredible honor,"" the ""blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda"" and be allowed to work with such a leader. And how could Trump fail to be dazzled by the steady diet of obsequious Fox anchors, who day after day claim he may just be the best president in the history of the United States, bringing ""sunshine beaming"" through the White House, as Fox Business's Lou Dobbs put it.

Of course, Trump has not needed much outside help to think highly of himself. He declares himself a ""very stable genius."" His Twitter feed is a torrent of adulation for the President, some of it quoting others, some provided by Trump himself (punctuated by reports of his unprecedented victimhood .)

Self-esteem, we're told, is a good thing. But we are also reminded to measure ""everything in moderation.""

Trump has apparently come to believe that he is so brilliant, so talented, so invincible, that he could get away with defying every norm, every practice, every institution of the democracy he is charged with leading. And, why wouldn't he? After all, he won the 2016 election -- though, we'll note, not the popular vote -- despite what all the experts said. And he did it after openly, publicly, asking Russia for help.

When the depths of Russian efforts to help Trump became known and fully, incontrovertibly documented, Trump still managed to survive. He survived the Mueller investigation, and continued to refer triumphantly to the scandalous episode of Russian interference to help him win as a scenario cooked up by his political adversaries, calling it to this day ""The Russia Hoax.""

Not only did he pull that off, he managed to convince a significant portion of the country that his lies are the truth and that the truth-tellers are the ""enemies of the people.""

All of this has fueled his hubris. And energized by it, he picked up the phone on July 25, the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified in Congress, and called President Zelensky -- a political novice who had played a president on TV.

When Zelensky told him Ukraine needs to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles to defend against a Russian-backed war, Trump replied, ""I would like you to do us a favor."" It sounds exactly like a suggestion of tit for tat or, in impeachment parlance, a quid pro quo.

By then, Trump had already held up the transfer of $400 million in urgently needed aid to Ukraine, a move that was exasperating and mystifying to members of Congress, which had approved the aid. But the reason for the holdup is becoming increasingly clear.

We might never have learned about all this were it not for the player who stepped on the scene in the manner of the hero in a Greek tragedy, the whistleblower. It is disheartening to know how many people in the administration have been aware of the alleged misdeeds of this presidency, and opted to keep quiet. But such are the flaws of humans. Whether or not they anger the gods, they remain a source of disappointment to those who try to do right.

Fortunately, an occasional brave man or woman rises to the challenge and, at great personal risk, takes actions to save the rest of us. That is the definition of heroism, and that is exactly what the whistleblower did. The whistleblower has given us in excruciating details an account of what happened in the White House, including the fact that the transcript of the July 25 call was not handled like a normal communication.

Instead, it was allegedly placed in a high-security computer system managed by the National Security Council, reserved for the most secret material, ""such as covert action.""

That looks very much like a cover-up. And, according to the whistleblower complaint, it was ""not the first time,"" it had happened.

The interactions with Ukraine by the President and some members of his team, notably his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, often seem more The Sopranos than the classics. And in the end, Trump may end up not only escaping removal by impeachment but also winning reelection in 2020.

It's a reminder that despite the crushing repercussions of hubris and the inspiring actions of a hero, this is, above all, a tragedy for the entire country."

The document contains no first-hand knowledge of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and relies entirely on leaks by “White House officials.” The “whistleblower” even admits: “I do not know which side initiated the call.”

Some allegations in the complaint seem to be distortions of exaggerations of information in the transcript itself, which the White House released Wednesday. For example, the whistleblower claims that Trump “praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Letsenko.” Trump appears never to have mentioned Letsenko, and his reference to a prosecutor (“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down”) was a reference to former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, on whose board Hunter Biden served, at the time Joe Biden demanded he be fired, under threat of withholding $1 billion in American aid.

In addition, the whistleblower goes beyond reporting alleged misconduct and proceeds to build a case against the president’s conduct of foreign relations with Ukraine, relying extensively on reports from the mainstream media, including the New York Times, The Hill, This Week with George Stephanopoulous on ABC News, and other sources.

That repeats a pattern from the “Russia collusion” claim, in which the FBI relied partly on media reports to justify applying for warrants to conduct surveillance on Trump campaign officials.

The document also alleges that the White House sequestered the transcript of the Ukraine phone call (though, given the fact that “Multiple White House officials” were apparently leaking its contents, perhaps there was good reason).

On Tuesday, Fox News reported that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General had found that the whistleblower had a political bias against the president and in favor of one of his 2020 rivals. The document seems to confirm that, as it devotes attention to policy arguments against Trump’s conduct of relations with Ukraine.

The whistleblower complains, for example, about decisions made by the administration, including the cancelation of a trip by Vice President Mike Pence to attend Zelensky’s inauguration.

526,Kristina Wong,"The Hill‘s John Solomon is reporting that the documents — many from the American legal team that helped the company, Burisma Holdings, try to stave off its legal troubles — raise the “troubling prospect” that U.S. officials  may have “painted a false picture … [+10612 chars]",Hundreds of pages of documents conflict with a story that Biden has been telling about him pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor.,2019-09-27,Breitbart News,Report: Hundreds of Documents Conflict with Joe Biden’s Account of Why Ukrainian Prosecutor Was Fired,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/09/26/report-hundreds-of-documents-conflict-with-joe-bidens-account-of-why-ukrainian-prosecutor-was-fired/,"Hundreds of pages of never-released memos and documents conflict with a story that former Vice President Joe Biden has been telling about him pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor because he was corrupt, and not because the prosecutor was investigating a company that hired his son, according to a report.

The Hill‘s John Solomon is reporting that the documents — many from the American legal team that helped the company, Burisma Holdings, try to stave off its legal troubles — raise the “troubling prospect” that U.S. officials may have “painted a false picture in Ukraine that helped “ease Burisma’s legal troubles and stop prosecutors’ plans to interview” Biden’s son Hunter during the 2016 presidential elections.

Solomon reported that, for instance, an official Ukrainian government memo shows that Burisma’s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after Biden forced the firing of the chief prosecutor and offered “an apology for dissemination of false information by U.S. representatives and public figures” about Ukrainian prosecutors.

In other words — the company that employed Biden’s son apologized to the Ukrainian government after the firing of the chief prosecutor for the “U.S. representatives and public figures” actions or remarks.

Solomon also reported that Burisma’s American team offered to introduce Ukrainian prosecutors to Obama administration officials to make amends, according to the Ukrainian government memo and Burisma’s American legal team’s internal memos.

According to Solomon, the memos raise the following “troubling questions”:

1) If the Ukraine prosecutor’s firing involved only his alleged corruption and ineptitude, why did Burisma’s American legal team refer to those allegations as “false information?” 2) If the firing had nothing to do with the Burisma case, as Biden has adamantly claimed, why would Burisma’s American lawyers contact the replacement prosecutor within hours of the termination and urgently seek a meeting in Ukraine to discuss the case?

Solomon reported that in a “newly sworn affidavit prepared for a European court,” Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin testified that when he was fired in March 2016, he was told the reason was that Biden was unhappy about the Burisma investigation.

“The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors,” Shokin testified, according to Solomon.

“On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company but I refused to close this investigation,” Shokin reportedly said.

Solomon said other documents show that as Biden’s efforts to fire Shokin picked up steam, Burisma’s American legal team “appeared to be moving into Ukraine with intensity.”

Burisma’s accounting records “show that it paid tens of thousands of dollars while Hunter Biden served on the board of an American lobbying and public relations firm, Blue Star Strategies, run by Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano, who both served in President Bill Clinton’s administration.”

According to Solomon, just days before Shokin’s firing, Painter met with the second highest official at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington and asked to meet officials in Kiev around the same time that Joe Biden visited there.

Ukrainian embassy employee Oksana Shulyar reportedly emailed Painter afterward: “With regards to the meetings in Kiev, I suggest that you wait until the next week when there is an expected vote of the government’s reshuffle.”

Ukraine’s Washington embassy confirmed the conversations between Shulyar and Painter but said the reference to a shakeup in Ukrainian government was not specifically referring to Shokin’s firing or anything to do with Burisma, according to Solomon.

Painter reportedly asked one of the Ukraine embassy’s workers to “open the door for meetings with Ukraine’s prosecutors about the Burisma investigation.” Blue Star would eventually pay that Ukrainian official money for his help with the prosecutor’s office, according to Solomon.

At the same time, Blue Star worked in concert with an American criminal defense lawyer, John Buretta, who was hired by Burisma to help address the case in Ukraine, according to Solomon. That case was settled in January 2017 for a few million dollars in fines for alleged tax issues, he reported.

Solomon reported that Buretta, Painter, Tramontano, Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden’s campaign have not responded to “numerous calls and emails seeking comment.”

On March 29, 2016, the day Shokin’s firing was announced, Buretta reportedly asked to speak with Yuriy Sevruk, the prosecutor named to temporarily replace Shokin, but was turned down.

However, Blue Star, using the Ukrainian embassy worker it had hired, eventually scored a meeting with Sevruk on April 6, 2016, a week after Shokin’s firing. Buretta, Tramontano, and Painter attended that meeting in Kiev, according to Blue Star’s memos, Solomon reported.

Sevruk memorialized the meeting in a government memo that the general prosecutor’s office provided to Solomon, stating that the three Americans offered an apology for the “false” narrative that had been provided by U.S. officials about Shokin being corrupt and inept.

“They realized that the information disseminated in the U.S. was incorrect and that they would facilitate my visit to the U.S. for the purpose of delivering the true information to the State Department management,” the memo reportedly stated.

The memo also reportedly quoted the Americans as saying they knew Shokin pursued an aggressive corruption investigation against Burisma’s owner, only to be thwarted by British allies:

These individuals noted that they had been aware that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine had implemented all required steps for prosecution … and that he was released by the British court due to the underperformance of the British law enforcement agencies.

This memo provides a “vastly different portrayal” of Shokin than Biden’s account, Solomon reported.

Solomon said the contents of the memo are partially backed by subsequent emails from Blue Star and Buretta that confirm the offer to bring Ukrainian authorities to meet the Obama administration in Washington:

For instance, Tramontano wrote the Ukrainian prosecution team on April 16, 2016, saying U.S. Justice Department officials, including top international prosecutor Bruce Swartz, might be willing to meet. ‘The reforms are not known to the US Justice Department and it would be useful for the Prosecutor General to meet officials in the US and share this information directly,’ she wrote. Buretta sent a similar email to the Ukrainians, writing that ‘I think you would find it productive to meet with DOJ officials in Washington’ and providing contact information for Swartz. ‘I would be happy to help,’ added Buretta, a former senior DOJ official. Burisma, Buretta and Blue Star continued throughout 2016 to try to resolve the open issues in Ukraine, and memos recount various contacts with the State Department and the U.S. embassy in Kiev seeking help in getting the Burisma case resolved. Just days before Trump took office, Burisma announced it had resolved all of its legal issues. And Buretta gave an interview in Ukraine about how he helped navigate the issues.

Solomon reported that Ukrainian prosecutors say they have tried to get this information to the Justice Department since the summer of 2018, fearing it is evidence of possible violations of U.S. ethics laws, and they hired a former federal prosecutor to bring the information to the U.S. Attorney in New York, who reportedly “showed no interest.” The Ukrainians then reached out to Tump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

As Solomon noted, the New York Times first published a story in December 2015 about Burisma hiring Hunter Biden just weeks after the vice president was asked by President Obama to oversee U.S.-Ukraine relations. That story also alerted Biden’s office that Shokin had an active investigation of Burisma and its founder, he noted.

Solomon detailed his previous reporting on “an effort to change the narrative” after the Times story about Hunter Biden ran, “with the help of the Obama State Department”:

Hunter Biden’s American business partner in Burisma, Devon Archer, texted a colleague two days after the Times story about a strategy to counter the ‘new wave of scrutiny’ and stated that he and Hunter Biden had just met at the State Department. The text suggested there was about to be a new “USAID project the embassy is announcing with us” and that it was “perfect for us to move forward now with momentum.” I have sued the State Department for any records related to that meeting. The reason is simple: There is both a public interest and an ethics question to knowing if Hunter Biden and his team sought State’s assistance while his father was vice president. The controversy ignited anew earlier this year when I disclosed that Joe Biden admitted during a 2018 videotaped speech that, as vice president in March 2016, he threatened to cancel $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, to pressure Ukraine’s then-President Petro Poroshenko to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin’s office was investigating Burisma. Shokin told me he was making plans to question Hunter Biden about $3 million in fees that Biden and his partner, Archer, collected from Burisma through their American firm. Documents seized by the FBI in an unrelated case confirm the payments, which in many months totaled more than $166,000. Some media outlets have reported that, at the time Joe Biden forced the firing in March 2016, there were no open investigations. Those reports are wrong. A British-based investigation of Burisma’s owner was closed down in early 2015 on a technicality when a deadline for documents was not met. But the Ukraine Prosecutor General’s office still had two open inquiries in March 2016, according to the official case file provided me. One of those cases involved taxes; the other, allegations of corruption. Burisma announced the cases against it were not closed and settled until January 2017. After I first reported it in a column, the New York Times and ABC News published similar stories confirming my reporting. Joe Biden has since responded that he forced Shokin’s firing over concerns about corruption and ineptitude, which he claims were widely shared by Western allies, and that it had nothing to do with the Burisma investigation.

Solomon wrote, “Today, two questions remain:”

One is whether it was ethically improper or even illegal for Biden to intervene to fire the prosecutor handling Burisma’s case, given his son’s interests. That is one that requires more investigation and the expertise of lawyers.

“The second is whether Biden has given the American people an honest accounting of what happened. The new documents I obtained raise serious doubts about his story’s credibility. And that’s an issue that needs to be resolved by voter,” Solomon wrote."

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is reportedly considering an investigation into the former Vice President, according to sources that spoke to the Washington Post. The senator, himself, appeared to confirm an investigation was likely when speaking to reporters about the topic on Wednesday.

“We have and will continue to gather information and conduct oversight on alleged misconduct within government agencies,” Johnson said.

The move comes after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government investigate Hunter Biden’s tenure on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the company in 2014, purportedly making as much as $83,000 per month, to consult on legal services. The appointment immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about the true nature of his role, since he possessed no background in either the energy industry or Ukraine.

Around the same tim Hunter Biden joined Burisma, his father was appointed as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine. Even more troubling is that at the time of the appointment, Burisma was attempting to sway western leaders after its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, was accused of money laundering and had his assets seized in Great Britain. Zlochevsky is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s leading oligarchs and has strong political ties to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Even more troubling is the fact that in 2016, Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Victor Shokin, who was known to be investigating Zlochevsky and Burisma. Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid if Shokin was not removed came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

The explanation, however, was only muddied when Shokin’s successor, who had previously served a prison sentence for public corruption, closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

If Johnson were to open a probe into the former vice president, it would likely overlap with an existing probe by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) into Hunter Biden’s business ties to China. In August, Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, began investigating the Obama-Biden administration’s decision to approve the sale of a U.S. company with insight into “military applications” to the Chinese government and an investment firm run by Hunter Biden.

In particular, Grassley has questioned if the decision to approve the sale violated the White House’s ethical guidelines governing conflicts of interest."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would fare better than Joe Biden (D) in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup against President Trump, a Daily Kos/Civiqs poll released on Thursday found.

Civiqs surveyed 1,548 registered voters September 21-24, 2019, and asked respondents whom they would support in hypothetical general election matchups featuring the president and top Democrat presidential candidates.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

“This is what the bottom line is: Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the ruling class, and the ruling class is fighting back hard as hell, and they are never going to stop,” Watters said, pointing out that Democrats had been accusing Trump of corruption since the launch of his presidential campaign.

“He beat back Spygate, the Russia hoax, he exposed Hillary and all of her corruption, and now, he’s beginning to expose the Biden family corruption in Ukraine and in China, and they want to impeach him for exposing Biden’s corruption,” Watters added.

“This is what’s going on,” he continued. “The left says they don’t believe what Biden did — abusing his power, abusing taxpayer money, and his son enriching himself — is a crime. They think it’s a crime for Trump to say, ‘Hey, can you look into that?’”

Watters concluded that the previous administration wanted to investigate Trump for crimes in 2016 “on the basis of no evidence,” using the power of a foreign country to do so.

The transcript of the July 25 call, released on Wednesday, shows Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the dealings of 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

Trump, who authorized the “unredacted” memo’s release, called Democrat efforts for impeachment nothing more than a “witch hunt.”

“You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!” Trump said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”"

During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel asked Joe Biden how the controversy surrounding his dealings with Ukraine rank on the “outlandish scale” of his career in politics.

“Uh, 18 out of 10,” Biden responded. “This is kind of bizarre… When you step back from it this is not about me and my family, there is not one single, solitary, legitimate journalist in the world who has given any credibility to this, they have debunked all of what [Trump has said] since Guiliani started this a while ago.”

According to a transcript of the conversation released on Monday, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden’s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy firm where his son Hunter had been a board member.

Biden denied any truth to allegations, declaring that there is who has corroborated such claims, which were first reported by Breitbart Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer in his bestselling book Secret Empires.

“Look, we want to get his attention. I have 70 polls in a row showing me beating him, and that all of sudden gets his attention,” Biden said. “And so I think that’s why I’m the object of his attention.”

Kimmel went on to ask Biden whether Trump making such requests to a foreign leader amounted to an impeachable offense after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced earlier this week that the House of Representatives would proceed with an official impeachment inquiry.

“Based on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me that it’s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,” Biden said. “But look, I am confident in the ability of the House and Senate to deal with this. My job is to go out and flat-beat him.”

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) on Wednesday called for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Congress to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s potentially “corrupt practices.”

Congressman Gosar called for an investigation into Biden’s potentially corrupt practices after reading the transcript of a phone conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that happened in July 2019.

The transcript reportedly establishes that the Ukrainian government fired a prosecutor that was investigating Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his allegedly corrupt business deals. Biden reportedly threated the Ukrainian government, saying that if the government would not accede to his demands, he would withhold foreign aid to Ukraine.

The Arizona conservative contended, after reading the transcript, that Biden used his station as vice president to force a foreign nation to do something that would “personally financially benefit” his son. Gosar said that this action is in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.

Congressman Gosar explained:

I have reviewed the transcript of the phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Zelenskyy and concluded that the evidence of then Vice President Biden’s potential corruption warrants a full investigation by Congress and the Department of Justice. It appears, based on former Vice President Biden’s admission captured on video, that he used his official office as Vice President to coerce a foreign nation to take action that would personally financially benefit the Vice President’s son. This is the definition of a corrupt practice. Under federal law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, et seq. (“FCPA”), a federal government official cannot assist or intervene to influence a foreign official in their official capacity to take an act that is in violation of their domestic duties “in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.” Thus, using his official office, and using the threat of withholding official U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine, it appears Biden influenced a foreign official to stop executing their official duties which consisted of investigating Hunter Biden, in order to benefit his son Hunter Biden. This would, if proven by the DOJ, constitute a violation of the FCPA.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was enacted to prevent certain officials from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining businesses.

Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Breitbart News Saturday that the media continue to “bypass” Biden’s scandals to focus on Trump

“Accordingly, as there is a prima facie case, I am asking the Fraud Section of the DOJ, through the auspices of the Attorney General, to open an investigation of this matter,” Gosar concluded in his statement."

Sekulow called the probe into alleged Trump wrongdoing a “faux investigation” over something that would not be admitted in court, hinting at a conspiracy because the complaint appears to have been “written by a law firm.”

“When you start with a witness saying, Steve and Brian, ‘I have no knowledge of the events I’m depicting here, and I’m basing this on conversations I had with colleagues of mine, and I think they’re trustworthy,’ well, do you know if they heard it correctly? I don’t know because I don’t have firsthand knowledge. And do you think the whistleblower drafted that complaint? I mean, realistically?” Sekulow posited.

“You think they had help?” co-host Brian Kilmeade asked. “Did they have help?”

“Look at the phraseology, the endnotes, and the footnotes,” Sekulow replied. “This wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm. And you know what?

Despite her anti-corruption agenda, Warren initially said “No” she would not allow her vice president’s children to serve on the boards of foreign companies, but she quickly backtracked the answer, saying, “I don’t know.”

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

The sign was changed back to its previous message around 10 a.m., and the Seattle Department of Transportation put additional safeguards in place to “prevent further incidents.”

The sign hack comes a day after 231 House Democrats voted to conduct a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over reports that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

These House Democrats backed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) initial move Tuesday afternoon by announcing an impeachment inquiry into Trump via press conference over a White House transcript between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The transcript of the July 25 call, released on Wednesday, shows Trump discussing a corruption inquiry into the dealings of 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said on the July 25 call, according to the released memo. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

Asked about how the impeachment inquiry is received by “people on the ground,” the voter noted that the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden, received little attention until President Trump highlighted the Biden family’s possible wrongdoings.

“Biden got a nice little deal for his boy and got a whole bunch of money for him and his firm and nobody said nothing about it,” the voter told correspondent Ali Vitali. “All of a sudden, Trump opens his mouth and says something and it’s ‘Oh my god, impeach him!'”

Schweizer, the president of the Government Accountability Institute and a senior Breitbart contributor, published Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends in 2018 — exposing several questionable deals in close proximity to Biden’s foreign policy activities as Vice President. Now, it appears that this debate over Trump, Ukraine, and Biden has made Secret Empires‘ revelations a topic penetrating everyday discussions across America.

This week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry over a partisan CIA officer’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint alleging President Trump pressured Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Hunter Biden. On Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, which shows no pressure was applied, and Zelensky himself has vehemently denied any push from the president to probe Biden. Notably, the complaint, which was released on Thursday, is based on second-hand accounts and possesses several inaccuracies.

“I think some of these people in the Congress should get back to doing their job instead of what they’ve been trying to do for two years,” the Granite State voter told MSNBC. “We have people that are living in this country that are depending on them doing stuff for us and they aren’t doing anything for us.”

When asked for his thoughts on House Democrats moving forward with their impeachment inquiry, the voter exclaimed. “They’re crazy.”

The voter’s sheer lack of interest in the issue of impeachment was echoed by former Ohio governor John Kasich (R), who said Friday that Ohioans aren’t talking about the inquiry or the call that prompted it.

“I’m out here in Ohio, I’m finally back in the heartland. There’s nobody talking about this. There’s nobody coming up to me and saying “Oh my goodness!” So, it takes time and it’s got to be made clear to the public what this is all about. Therefore, I think this investigation has to continue,” he told CNN’s New Day.

During his remarks, Trump took aim at the media, former Vice President Joe Biden, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and the so-called “whistleblower” who set the stage for impeachment proceedings led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“We’re at war,” he said. “These people are sick, they’re sick and nobody’s called it out like I do, I don’t understand, people are afraid to call it out, they are afraid to say that the press is crooked, we have a crooked press, we have a dishonest media.”

When Trump mentioned “Liddle” Adam Schiff, a person in the audience shouted “pencil neck” prompting Trump to repeat the nickname that he coined on Twitter.

“That name stuck,” Trump grinned. “He’s got a neck, it’s about this big. He’s got shirts that are too big because you can’t buy shirts that are that small.”

Video of Trump’s fundraiser remarks was leaked to Bloomberg News and audio of the conversation was leaked to the New York Times.

He also mocked Biden, a potential 2020 rival for president.

“And then you have sleepy Joe Biden who is dumb as a rock, this guy was dumb on his best day, and he’s not having his best day right now,” Trump continued.

He appeared incredulous that Biden’s son Hunter Biden earned millions of dollars from Ukraine and China after getting discharged from the Navy for cocaine use.

He said:

His kid, who’s got a lot of problems, he got thrown out of the Navy. I mean look I’m not going to — it’s a problem, that’s a problem, so we won’t get into why and all that. But he got thrown out of the Navy, and now this kid goes into Ukraine, walks away with millions of dollars, and he becomes a consultant for $50,000 a month. And he doesn’t know anything compared to anybody in this room. He’s a stiff, he knows nothing.

Trump also pointed to Hunter Biden’s work in China, getting $1.5 billion in an investment fund after flying with his father to visit the country on Air Force Two.

“That’s probably not all they gave him, they gave him plenty more I’m sure,” he said. “We might never find out.”

He suggested that Hunter Biden’s activities overseas paled in comparison to his actions.

“And then they talk about me, and I didn’t do anything,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m the most innocent person in the world.”

Trump described the whistleblower as “fake,” and “highly partisan,” suggesting that he was a “spy.”

He said:

[B]asically that person never saw the report, never saw the call. Never saw the call. Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is — sort of like almost a spy. I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistle-blower the information because that’s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.

Trump said his conversation with Urkaine President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect.”

He described Zelensky as a “really nice gentleman” during his meeting with him on Wednesday, noting he told the press he never felt pressured by Trump to investigate Biden.

“These animals in the press, they’re animals… they’re some of the worst people you will ever meet,” Trump said. “They’re scum, many of them are scum, and you have some good reporters but not many of them, but that’s one of the things that we battle.”

Trump highlighted Democrat senators that “strong-armed” Ukraine to participate in the Russia investigation, describing them as hypocrites.

Trump said that his chances for reelection were “looking good” and referred to a clip from HBO’s Bill Maher for telling a guest that Trump would win and “never leave” the presidency.

“I thought he was kidding, he was being serious,” Trump marveled.

He also cited a TIME magazine video featuring Trump 2020, Trump 2024, and Trump 2028 campaign signs that he repeatedly shared on Twitter.

“As tho [sic] those are different things,” the reporter remarked.

I think his issue is that I described the president asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden as the president asking a foreign government to help him win an election, as tho those are different things — Arthur Delaney (@ArthurDelaneyHP) September 24, 2019

Sen. Hawley fired back at the HuffPost reporter, calling him out for his alleged bias against the president.

“Just admit you want to see the President impeached – and you’re willing to distort & mislead to get it done,” Hawley wrote.

Sen. Hawley then released the transcript of his interview with the HuffPost reporter, contending that leftist “reporters” will “twist words and distort facts to advance their agenda.”

As the House moves towards impeaching the president, Sen. Hawley noted that, while America faces substantial problems across the nation, including a southern border crisis and drug addiction, the Democrats’ top priority is to impeach the president.

“We face a crisis on the southern border, a crisis of meth pouring into our towns, a crisis of youth suicide, an epic fight with China for our jobs and maybe our national security — and the Democrats’ top priority is to … impeach @realDonaldTrump,” Hawley wrote. “Says it all.”

However, his assertion is patently false. The poll did not ask a broad question on impeachment. Rather, the results he cites are in reference to a very specific question, asking respondents if they would support impeachment in the event that President Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to push Ukrainian leaders to dig up dirt on his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden (D), as well as his son.

The question is as follows: “If President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, would you support or oppose impeachment?”

In that specific scenario, 55 percent would support impeachment. The results do not suggest that the majority of Americans support an impeachment inquiry, as McManus suggested.

A Quinnipiac University poll published Wednesday revealed low support for impeachment, with 37 percent of Americans in favor and 57 percent disapproving of such a measure.

A slew polls have paralleled Quinnipiac’s findings, with the majority of Americans opposing impeaching the president. Despite lack of public support or a legitimate impeachable offense, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) officially announced the formal impeachment inquiry this week.

As Breitbart News reported, every Democrat member of the House went on the record to support the latest impeachment effort thanks to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who forced the House to vote on a resolution “formally condemning the way in which Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry.”

“We have the opportunity to act now to prevent a profoundly destabilizing action and intervention in our democracy before it happens,” she said. “And I think that is a profoundly urgent action that we need to take right now.”

Ocasio-Cortez said that previous House investigations into Trump have tended to focus on alleged past actions.

“When it comes to Ukraine we are talking about a potential meddling in the 2020 election that has still yet to happen.”

Trump has denied wrongdoings during his July 25 phone conversation with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

A whistleblower has alleged Trump violated federal campaign finance laws by threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky’s government investigated the former vice president and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden for corruption.

The White House released on Wednesday a transcript of the call in which the two heads of state discussed Biden, but the transcript showed no discussion of military aid or any quid pro quo.

In the phone transcript, Trump said:

There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Trump tweeted Wednesday that he supports full transparency on the whistleblower information, but added that transparency is also needed from Biden and any potential wrongdoing concerning his son, Hunter.

The president was referencing a 2018 letter sent to Ukrainian officials by Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy urging them to continue investigations into President Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign. Such allegations have since proven baseless.

“The Democrats have done what they’re accusing me of doing,” Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday.

Pence was at MacAllister Machinery to talk about the United States-Mexico-Canada deal that the Trump administration has negotiated to replace NAFTA.

Earlier in the day, the House Intelligence Committee held a hearing on a whistleblower complaint alleging that President Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 elections.

The complaint was based largely on a phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine. The president has denied any wrongdoing and the White House released the transcript of that call on Wednesday.

Still, Democrats at the hearing claimed that Trump acted inappropriately by asking the Ukrainian president to help Attorney General William Barr, who is looking into the origins of the 2016 Russia collusion allegations, and to assist his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who is looking into reports of Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden working for a Ukrainian company that was under investigation by Ukraine’s top prosecutor.

Biden, as vice president, worked to get the prosecutor fired, even bragging that he withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine until he was fired. Biden has dismissed allegations of acting inappropriately."

In worse news for impeachment-crazed Democrats, only 46 percent of Democrats call it treason. In other words, not even a majority of Democrats are buying this manure.

As far as the rest of the electorate, only 24 percent of independents call it treason, as do 11 percent of Republicans. (Another word for those 11 PERCENT OF Republicans might be “cucks.”)

Rasmussen adds this key piece of context: “By way of comparison, that’s lower than the number who believe President Trump committed treason in his dealings with the Russians.”

That number that entered the thirties, and we all know where that whole Russia Collusion thing ended up.

As far as those who believe Trump should now be impeached, that number has not budged throughout the week-long Ukraine Hoax — 44 percent.

Rasmussen, the founder of Rasmussen Reports, who is now an independent, also found that this fake scandal has not damaged Trump’s job approval ratings, which remain steady at 47 percent. On the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Trump’s job approval rating sits at a relatively healthy 45 percent, little changed from last week.

On the question of the call itself, only 43 percent of voters believe Trump behaved inappropriately; this includes 66 percent of Democrats, 45 percent of independents, and 15 percent of Republicans.

While only 18 percent of Democrats believe the call was appropriate, 58 percent of Republicans say it was, as do 20 percent of independents. The rest are not sure.

This Ukraine Hoax does appear to be hurting former Vice President Joe Biden. When the pollster asked, “Which Democratic presidential candidate had been accused of inappropriate dealings with Ukraine, 56% selected Joe Biden and 29% were not sure.”

The partisan breakdown in the Biden number is 52 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of independents, and 66 percent of Republicans. What that tells you is that despite the corrupt media’s attempt to protect Biden from the news that his son made millions from a Ukrainian energy company (when he has no energy experience whatsoever), the news is still getting out, which might explain the slow leak in Biden’s poll numbers.

These Rasmussen numbers are terrible for the Democrats and their media handlers, who have pushed all their chips into the middle of the impeachment table. Thanks to the eternal wisdom of America’s Founding Fathers, impeachment is deliberately set up as a political process, which means it can only be done with the will of the people, which means Democrats have painted themselves into a corner that only ends with Trump being able to claim he’s been exonerated, which is exactly what happened with the Russia Collusion Hoax.

You can’t overturn a presidential election with numbers like these, and with the Ukraine Hoax, this is going to be as good as it gets for Democrats. The transcript of the phone call was supposed to be the smoking gun, but as we all saw and as this poll makes clear, there was 1) nothing smoking and 2) no gun. It wasn’t even a cherry bomb or a mouse fart.

It’s a steaming pile of Hoax.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R), a staunch Trump critic, was first to back the impeachment probe, saying in a statement Wednesday the move is “appropriate,” but lawmakers on Capitol Hill must further investigate the matter before reaching a conclusion whether to remove the president.

House Democrats are moving expeditiously with an impeachment probe in light of a partisan CIA officer’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint alleging President Trump pressured Zelensky during a July 25th call to probe the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.)

Though Democrats claim the contents of the call — a transcript of which was released by the White House this week — show a clear attempt by President Trump to invite Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election, Zelensky himself has passionately denied the allegation, saying he felt no pressure whatsoever from the president to probe the Biden family.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky, flanked by the president, told reporters at the United Nations in New York City.

On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee released the complaint ahead of acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire testify before the panel to discuss the handling of the complaint. During the hearing, Maguire was goaded several times to comment on the complaint’s credibility — something he maintained was for the intelligence community inspector general to discern.

Though, what federal authorities have confirmed is complaint’s author did not listen to the Trump-Zelensky call and only possessed second-hand information, which as Sen. Michael Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News Thursday, amounts to “hearsay.” Further, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel’s (OLC) affirmed the Deep Stater harbors a bias for a political rival of President Trump."

According to the complaint released Thursday, the officer claimed Ulrich Brechbuhl listened into the July 25th call between the president and Zelensky and that several State officials were later briefed on the details of their discussion.

The nine-page complaint addresses President Trump’s call with Zelensky, in which the president discussed, separately, both U.S. military aid to Ukraine and allegations of potential wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige.

While President Trump suggested Zelensky look into the Bidens, the Ukrainian president has vehemently denied being pressured to do so.

Phil Scott became the nation’s first Republican state chief executive this week to support congressional Democrats’ formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, saying Congress possesses a “solemn responsibility” to hold the president accountable.

Scott, a staunch critic of President Trump, argued in a Wednesday statement that while an impeachment probe is “appropriate,” lawmakers on Capitol Hill must further investigate the matter before reaching a conclusion whether to oust the president. His comments came a day prior to the House intelligence committee released an anonymous federal employee’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint against President Trump, which is now at the center of a congressional impeachment investigation.

The complaint, submitted by an unidentified intelligence official, addresses President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the president suggested the Kiev leader to investigate the son of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The complaint claims White House officials were concerned enough about the contents of the phone call that they moved to “lock down” the record of the communication. The whistle-blower was concerned President Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country,” it states.

“The interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals,” the complaint states. “The president’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.”

However, according to a transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday, its contents show no pressure for Ukraine to probe the Biden family, and President Zelensky denied he felt any pressure to look into the former vice president or his son, Hunter Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.)

Nonetheless, following the transcript’s release House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) re-upped her support for a formal impeachment probe, accusing the president of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

For truth text me. +1 (319) 519-0576 — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) September 25, 2019

Yahoo Entertainment reported that the number sent out a series of automated text messages in which Kutcher semi-coherently expounded on Trump and the impeachment inquiry underway in the House. Kutcher’s number no longer appears to be sending out the Trump-themed text messages.

The That 70s Show star reportedly said in one text message that Trump should be impeached even if he didn’t use the prospect of financial aid to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden.

“If our president used that financial aid to leverage president Zelensky to investigate Biden should be impeached. If our president did not use it as leverage and simply encouraged president Zelensky to investigate Biden without cause he should be impeached.”

Kutcher also texted: “If you like President Trump or not America is the priority soliciting foreign interference in our election in [sic] unAmerican.”

In another text message, Kutcher says he and Kunis met with Zelensky and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Kutcher’s claim appears to be true, with Zelenska posting photos of the two couples on her official Instagram account.

Kutcher posted Wednesday a series of tweets that were veiled attacks at Trump.

“Buzz words: witch hunt, collusion, fake news. Ignore it all just look at facts,” the actor tweeted.

Buzz words: witch hunt, collusion, fake news. Ignore it all just look at facts. — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) September 25, 2019

Unlike many of his fellow Hollywood stars, the 41-year-old Kutcher has largely refrained from publicly voicing his opinions of Trump, although he did once urge Ivanka Trump on Twitter to push gun control.

But the allegations contained in Moore’s new book have cast Kutcher in an unflattering light.

Kutcher appeared ready to respond to the allegations in the book, but said he ultimately decided to delete it.

I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it. ❤️ — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) September 25, 2019

Trump released the transcript from his call, which appeared to not show any wrongdoing on the president’s part.

Although Democrats have maintained Trump sought to create a quid pro quo with Ukraine, Toobin said Schiff’s fight to prove Trump was involved in impropriety “didn’t really have that much juice to it.”

“There was sort of an air of unreality about it because the complaint and the transcript, the partial transcript, have now been turned over,” Toobin explained. “So, the fight didn’t really have that much juice to it, but that was really what the issue was about.”

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

“This is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by Trump,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) assessed. “The House must thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election”:

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) proclaimed the existence of a “cover-up” and called for White House officials to be subpoenaed to testify under oath “about what else they may have covered up for Donald Trump”:

Like Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that Trump “believes he is above the law” and predicted that he will “continue to commit crimes from the White House” until lawmakers take action.

“The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires,” she wrote:

Julián Castro (D) described the president as an “active national security threat” and said the complaint “exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House”:

Both Castro and Beto O’Rourke (D) called on the House to cancel its scheduled recess to begin impeachment proceedings.

“As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act,” O’Rourke added:

Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Thursday that the deep state intelligence operative’s whistleblower complaint amounts to nothing more than “hearsay.”

Sen. Braun spoke to Breitbart News about a deep state intelligence operative’s whistleblower complaint regarding President Donald Trump’s conversation with President Zelensky regarding former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his potentially corrupt business practices in Ukraine. Democrats and establishment media allege that this amounts to asking the Ukraine government to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.

The reports have sparked calls from Democrats to impeach the president.

Sen. Braun called the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conversation with Zelensky a “smaller version of what the Mueller report was all about.”

The Hoosier senator said that the “Democrats are trying to find whatever they might cook into whatever they can— which they have been doing from the get-go.”

Braun said that most Republicans have the “general feeling” that the Democrats continue to fight the president any way they can–regardless of whether the president committed impeachable offenses.

Sen. Braun said that the “unknown third-party whistleblower” did not hear the information “directly,” which means that the information amounts to “hearsay.”

The Hoosier conservative’s sentiment also spreads to Congress’s lower chamber. A House aide said that Democrats’ move to impeach Trump has “re-united the Republican base.”

A Republican aide to a senior Republican congressman told Breitbart News in a statement, “Democrats just re-united the Republican base. By releasing this bogus ‘whistleblower complaint’ that details nothing more than hearsay and partisanship, Adam Schiff et al. just guaranteed President Trump’s re-election. Personally, I’d like to thank them for doing so.”

“I’m not going to waste a lot of time and energy on the hypotheticals and particulars,” Sen. Braun said, regarding the Democrats’ latest charges against the president.

Sen. Braun also said that he believes it is “valid” for the president to be interested in “corruption” that might be surrounding former Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden.

The Hoosier senator also lamented that the Democrats’ latest move to impeach the president has distracted from more pressing issues such as healthcare and infrastructure.

“I come from the world that’s interested in” improving Americans’ lives, Sen. Braun said.

Braun noted that, in the Senate, there was broad interest in tackling surprise medical bills.

“I don’t think we’re making any progress on healthcare reform,” Sen. Braun said. “There was so much on the platter, there were 80 senators on it, and it was so bipartisan thing I’ve seen in a long time, and that’s because the healthcare industry is broken. These huge corporations don’t believe in competition and transparency.”

Sen. Braun also said that impeachment would take “time away from things like infrastructure.”

“It’s [American infrastructure] still falling apart and getting worse each year,” he added."

In a world where America enjoyed the services of legitimate news organizations, the far-left ABC News would have already retracted this story, would have removed it completely, because… As you will see below, the story is now a non-story. The central premise of the story has been wiped out by the facts. But, as we all know, ABC News is not a legitimate news organization, so let me welcome you to…

Russian Collusion 2: Even More Fake Newsier!

Oh, yeah, ABC News thought We got Drumpf now fer realzies! with the bombsheLOL revelation that the White House had set a very definite “precondition” for President’s Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy: a precondition that Joe Biden must be discussed!

Holy moly!

Smoking gun!

Frog march the Bad Orange Man out of the Oval Office in handcuffs right now!

But wait… It gets worse…

This bombshell was an “on the record” statement from no one less than one of Zelenskiy’s own advisers!

That’s it!

It’s over!

THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN!!!!

Except for one little thing…

Well, actually two little things…

Okay, I lied, they are both big things…

Ginormous, really…

1) ABC’s source is not an adviser to the Ukrainian president. Oopsies.

2) The source did not tell ABC that discussing Biden was a precondition of the call. Oopsies.

In other words… The story is a fake, a fraud, doo doo, caca, dung, excrement, feces, garbage, fake news, a hoax, a con, a grift, a forgery, a scam, a sham, and did I properly welcome you to Russian Collusion 2: Even More Fake Newsier!

Now, as you know, I’m not going to link the ABC News story, because I don’t link fake news. But ABC was finally forced to add this teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy, microscopic, hardly-even-matters correction:

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Serhiy Leshchenko as a current advisor to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Leshchenko advised Zelenskiy’s transition team following his election in April but has since been distanced by the administration. He is no longer advising Zelenskiy.

And then there’s this from journalist Christopher Miller’s verified Twitter account: “Setting record straight: @Leshchenkos confirmed to me what those of us in Kyiv already knew—he is NOT currently an advisor to Ukraine’s Zelenskiy & wasn’t at time of July 25 call. He said he DID NOT tell ABC insistence for leaders to discuss Biden probe was precondition for call.”

Did you get that?

ABC’s source “DID NOT” tell ABC there was a precondition for the call.

And here’s how ABC News watered down the wording of its now not-so-bombshell:

“It was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,” said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine’s Parliament, who had been a former adviser to Zelenskiy but has recently been distanced from the administration. “This issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.”

So ABC News has gone from “precondition” to “understood.”

Look at what just happened here…

ABC News went from… An adviser to Ukraine’s president says a Trump precondition meant that Trump would not take Zelenskiy’s call if Biden was not discussed! — to — Some guy who used to work for Zelenskiy but hasn’t for a long time says something was understood, or something.

To begin with, you don’t make an honest mistake about whether your source is or is not a current adviser to the president of Ukraine.

Sorry, you just don’t.

ABC News knew this story was a pile of crap and reported it anyway because that is what the media has been doing throughout the Trump era: Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to win a news cycle against Trump, and then say oops.

Just like the Russia Collusion Hoax, we see this time and time and time again… As soon as the hoax falls apart, as the Ukraine Hoax did on Wednesday with the release of the phone call transcript, to cover up the debunking of their fake news, the media start hurling all the fake news they can get their hands on.

Yesterday, it was the far-left Washington Post with its fake news about Trump’s acting Director of National Intelligence threatening to resign. Today it’s ABC News straight-up lying about this.

Currently, 95 percent of Americans are troubled by the state of the media. Before the 2020 election is over, this will hit 99.9 percent. The holdouts will be Jim Acosta and Jake Tapper.

I could be wrong, but I honestly don’t think the overall public pays attention to the media anymore. They just roll their eyes and wait for it to be debunked, and it always is.

[He’s] willing to do whatever it takes to protect the president. He’s not a credible human being. His name has come up in this whole issue about the president’s call and work that’s been done with Ukraine to try to pressure them and get information about Biden. I know, given what he’s done in the past, that he’s guilty in being involved by either assisting Giuliani or doing other kinds of things to try and get Ukraine’s president to come out and get dirt on Biden.

ZACH STAFFORD: Beyond Bill Barr, we’d like to talk about Vice President Mike Pence. Trump recently said, “I think you should ask for Vice President Pence’s conversation” regarding Ukraine. What was your reaction to that and what do you think should happen with Mike Pence now?

REP. WATERS: First of all, we have seen that no matter what the president does, they come up with a kind of messaging to defend him. No matter what it is, none of them have had the courage, the patriotism, or the guts to stand up for what is right for our country. So I expect that Pence is part of this conspiracy to try to get Ukraine to do something in a fake investigation and come out with some dirt on Biden. I’m looking forward to that coming out in the hearings that will be done by the Judiciary Committee as they take up the impeachment resolution."

The American Thinker, which first brought the story to light, noted it is “an odd coincidence that Mitt has as CNN puts it ‘been a lone Republican voice expressing concern about President Donald Trump’s July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked Ukraine’s President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.’”

In October 2011, Romney announced that Black, who had served in the CIA since 1974, had been selected as a special adviser.

“I am deeply honored to have the counsel of this extraordinary group of diplomats, experts, and statesmen,” Romney said at the time. “Their remarkable experience, wisdom, and depth of knowledge will be critical to ensuring that the 21st century is another American Century.”

Black trained for covert operations and eventually became the director of the National Counterterrorism Center from 1999 until 2002. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks perpetrated by al-Qaeda, Black was appointed ambassador at large and coordinator for counterterrorism in December 2002 by President George W. Bush.

John Brennan succeeded Black in his job as director of the National Counterterrorism Center.

“I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the President, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,” he said in an opening statement at a hearing on Thursday focused on the whistleblower’s complaints.

He noted that the latest “operation” began with media reports that a whistleblower is claiming Trump made a nefarious “promise” to a foreign leader.

That assertion was debunked after the White House released the phone call in which Trump was alleged to have made that “promise” but did not, he said.

“But that didn’t matter. The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn’t need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president,” he said.

Nunes continued:

And what other information has come to light since the original false report of a ‘promise’ being made? We’ve learned the following: The complaint relied on hearsay evidence provided by the whistleblower. The Inspector General did not know the contents of the phone call at issue. The Inspector General found that the whistleblower displayed ‘arguable political bias’ against Trump. The Department of Justice investigated the complaint and determined no action was warranted. The Ukrainian President denies being pressured by President Trump. “So, once again, this supposed scandal ends up being nothing like what we were told,” he said. And once again, the Democrats, their media mouthpieces, and a cabal of leakers are ginning up a fake story, with no regard to the monumental damage they’re causing to our public institutions and to trust in government, and without acknowledging all the false stories they propagated in the past, including countless allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to hack the 2016 election. We’re supposed to forget about all those stories but believe this one. In short, what we have with this storyline is another Steele dossier.

The whistleblower complaint, released by the White House on Wednesday, alleged that Trump sought “interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election” by alleging seeking dirt from Ukraine on Joe Biden, who called for the firing of a prosecutor investigating a company his son Hunter Biden sat on the board of.

Nunes argued, as with the Russian collusion allegations, Democrats appeared to be accusing Trump of doing something they themselves have done:

Back then, they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russians when the Democrats themselves were colluding with Russians in preparing the Steele dossier. Today, they accuse the president of pressuring Ukrainians to take actions that would help himself or hurt his political opponents. And yet, there are numerous examples of Democrats doing the exact same thing.

He said for example:

Joe Biden bragged that he extorted the Ukrainians into firing a prosecutor, who happened to be investigating Biden’s own son. Three Democrat senators wrote a letter pressuring the Ukrainian general prosecutor to reopen investigations it reportedly froze on former Trump campaign officials. Another Democratic senator went to Ukraine and pressured the Ukrainian President not to investigate corruption allegations involving Biden’s son. According to Ukrainian officials, Democratic National Committee contractor Alexandra Chalupa tried to get Ukrainian officials to provide dirt on Trump associates and tried to get the former Ukrainian President to comment publicly on their alleged ties to Russia. Ukrainian official Serhiy Leshchenko was a source for Nellie Ohr, wife of Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr, as she worked on the anti-Trump operation conducted by Fusion GPS and funded by the Democrats.

Nunes also noted the time Schiff was prank-called and believed he was talking to a Ukrainian parliamentarian and tried to obtain nude pictures of Trump.

And of course, Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump.

As you see, it’s a reliable rule of thumb in these information operations that whatever the Democrats accuse you of doing, they’re doing themselves.

Nunes said Democrats were determined to impeach Trump despite Americans having the chance to vote him out in a year if they want:

Yes, winning elections is hard, and when you compete you have no guarantee you’ll win. But the American people should have a say in all this, and they made their voices heard in the election. This latest gambit by the Democrats to overturn the people’s mandate is unhinged and dangerous.

“They should end this entire dishonest, grotesque spectacle and get back to solving problems, which is what every member of this committee was sent here to do. Judging by today’s charade, however, the chances of that happening anytime soon are zero to none,” Nunes added.

In the nine-page document, the so-called “whistleblower” claims that the president was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.” While characterizing the Trump-Zelensky call based on hearsay, it accuses the White House of attempting to conceal records related to their conversation. Further, it claims President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is a “central figure” in the effort and alleges U.S. Attorney General William Barr “appears to be involved as well.”

“The interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political rivals,” the complaint states. “The president’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.”

The transcript of the call was released Wednesday, showing no pressure to investigate Biden, and President Zelensky denied in person that he felt any such pressure from the conversation. Nonetheless, following the transcript’s release House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) reaffirmed her support for a formal impeachment inquiry, accusing the president of using “taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.”

“Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” the speaker added. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”

The so-called “whistleblower’s” complaint was released shortly before acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire appeared before the House intelligence committee to discuss the handling of the complaint. The hearing began at 9 a.m. EDT and is being streamed live.

“This complaint is a roadmap for our investigation, and provides significant information for the committee to follow up on with other witnesses and documents,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement Thursday before the hearing.

Following the complaint’s release, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: “Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings—all of which shows nothing improper.”

Last week, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson appeared before the committee to discuss the whistle-blower complaint in a closed session. It was Atkinson who first received the complaint and thought it serious enough to report to Congress.

The complaint was made available to lawmakers Wednesday and was viewed by members of the House and Senate intel panels.

President Trump and Giuliani have said they encouraged Ukraine in other conversations to investigate the Bidens for pressuring Ukraine to fire Kiev Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the gas company Hunter Biden worked for.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.)

On Tuesday, President Trump said he asked White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to withhold the aid from Ukraine roughly one week before he spoke with Ukraine’s leader.

“As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” President Trump said ahead of his address before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. “They were fully paid.”

“I want other countries to put up money. I think it’s unfair that we put up the money,” he added. “Then other people call me. They said, ‘Oh, let it go.’ And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.”

Meanwhile, President Trump and his allies appear none-too-worried about the Democrats’ formal impeachment inquiry and have not only suggested it’s a sign that Pelosi has lost control of her caucus, but that it will bolster the president’s 2020 re-election chances.

“[Speaker Pelosi’s] been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party. You take a look at what’s happening in the media today. The whole party is taken over by the left and thank you very much — my poll numbers have gone up,” the president said Wednesday.

Of the impeachment probe, House Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News that Democrats “lost their minds” and predicted it will “backfire on them” in the 2020 election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” said McCarthy. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”

On Wednesday, President Trump’s reelection campaign announced – along with the Republican National Committee (RNC) – that $5 million had been raised following Pelosi’s announcement of the impeachment inquiry.

“In the 24 hours since news of Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment announcement, @realDonaldTrump’s campaign & @GOP have BLOWN OUT fundraising!” Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote on Twitter.

“$5 Million combined in 24 hrs. Donors in all 50 states Huge groundswell of support leading to Trump landslide in 2020!” he added.

Carlson focused Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for his categorization of Trump as a “mafia boss” regarding the allegation that the president was exerting pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden by calling him a “nut case.”

Partial transcript as follows:

CARLSON: Now that it is publicly available for Adam Schiff’s conspiracy addled brain, it has lurched into a different direction. Now, he is telling us that the transcript, the one that he has already denounced as fake, is in fact real. But it doesn’t show what it should show, which is to say it doesn’t show the President doing any of the things that supposedly justify impeachment. Why?

Well, Adam Schiff explains because the President, like a Navajo Code Talker, is speaking in secret code.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SCHIFF: This is how a mafia boss talks. What have you done for us? We’ve done so much for you. But there’s not much reciprocity. I have a favor I want to ask you. And what is that favor? Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival.

A classic mafia, like shakedown a foreign leader.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: So, you know, we’re not psychiatrists here, but honestly, Adam Schiff is a nut case. It’s true. It’s hard to believe he is in Congress. Poor people of Anaheim, or wherever he is from — Southern California, the Valley somewhere.

It’s hard to believe he is in actually in Congress. He is actually a committee chairman. Believe it or not. Too bad the 25th Amendment doesn’t apply to Members of Congress.

But to be fair, most Democrats are not anywhere near as crazy as Adam Schiff, not even the same ballpark. They’re just very cynical — extremely cynical — more cynical you’ve ever thought of being."

She continued:

The president himself admitted that he had a telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine. He also said he talked to him about Biden. And I believe that in that conversation, he did exactly what is being said about the conversation by others — that he was asking this president [Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine] to help him with the kind of investigation that would lead into dirt about Biden.

Waters also defended the “whistleblower” by stating the individual issued the complaint against the president due to being “concerned about this country”:

CNN's @ChrisCuomo: ""Do you think you know enough at this point, congresswoman, to say there is enough here for articles of impeachment?"" Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters: ""Absolutely."" https://t.co/BQcV4uqgCs pic.twitter.com/Hey3HhDZMZ — Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 27, 2019

However, Breitbart News reported Thursday that the complaint “contains no first-hand knowledge of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and relies entirely on leaks by ‘White House officials.'”

The report goes on to state that the “whistleblower” admitted in the document, “I do not know which side initiated the call.”

On Wednesday, Breitbart News reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General ruled that the “whistleblower” had a political bias, but the inspector general still found the anonymous individual “credible.”

However, President Trump defended himself on Twitter Friday by questioning if the “whistleblower” had been fed information to leak:

Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019

On Wednesday, Waters claimed that following President Trump’s inauguration in 2017, she knew he would be impeached.

“I started a long time ago, right after the president was inaugurated, talking about impeachment and saying that he was dishonorable, he was a conman, we could not trust him,” she said during an interview on MSNBC’s All In.

Waters also accused the president of being “brazen” and “disrespectful” of the Constitution, adding that “it does not even measure up to what we have just discovered over the past few days about him and his attempt to leverage and get the president of Ukraine to do his bidding and find dirt on his political opponent, and so all of this is different.”"

“It doesn’t meet the standard of a whistleblower, but more concerningly, the inspector general determined that this person has a political bias,” remarked Scalise, adding, “By the way, guess who is lawyered up, right now?

So you want to talk about deep state type connections, look at the fact this person, by the inspector general’s own determination, has a political bias.”

LISTEN:

Democrats seek to use impeachment of President Donald Trump as a “check on the electorate,” noted Scalise.

“Impeachment is a very powerful constitutional obligation that Congress is given as a check on an executive, not as a check on the electorate, which is what Nancy Pelosi’s using it as,” said Scalise.

On Wednesday, Scalise mocked Democrats with an impeachment-themed Mad Libs game.

Scalise stated, “It really is unbelievable. When you look at the hype that was building up on this thing. Of course the media has been frothing at the mouth since literally the day Donald Trump took office. They’ve wanted to get him out of office. The left has wanted to act like he’s not president or they want to remove him as president so they had a mission when they took the majority to impeach him, regardless of the facts.”

Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky illustrated the president’s commitment to increasing European states’ responsibilities for their own military and national security needs, observed Scalise.

“It does show what President Trump has been saying since he got in office,” said Scalise of the released transcript of Trump’s conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart.

Scalise concluded, “Over in the European Union, a lot of these countries won’t step up and do their part, especially for NATO. So [Donald Trump] called on NATO countries to [fulfill their] commitment [of] two percent of GDP for every country. Most of them are well below one percent, so Americans pick up the tab. A lot of people say, ‘Hey, we support the Ukraine,’ but America is really the only country that stood up and sold them Javelin missiles. Barack Obama wouldn’t sell them the Javelin missiles to stop Russia.”

McCarthy noted at National Review on Thursday that then-President Barack Obama’s administration asked Ukraine to investigate Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, in 2016.

McCarthy notes the double standard — that Democrats want to impeach Trump for doing what Obama did — and which they have been telling the world for years was necessary to do to protect American national security.

As House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told NBC News in March, his investigation into Trump dealt with “a present threat to our national security — whether the president and anybody around him are compromised by a foreign power.” If Trump colluded with Russia, or if the Russians had compromising information about him, they could hold enormous influence over the Trump administration — hence the need for investigation.

That is how Democrats defended the decision by intelligence and law enforcement officials under President Obama to conduct surveillance of Trump campaign associates — without warning Trump himself in a “defensive” briefing.

McCarthy notes that “the Obama administration’s law-enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort” in the middle of the 2016 presidential election.

He cites his recent book, Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency, recently excerpted on Fox News, which reports that Obama administration officials urged Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate Manafort — which amounted to “effectively meddling in the American presidential election.” The results were soon clear: leaks about Manafort’s activities in Ukraine began to appear in the U.S. media, spun in the worst possible light. He was replaced at the Trump campaign and became a target in the phony “collusion” narrative.

McCarthy notes the glaring double standard: “When the Obama administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, “But look how corrupt Paul Manafort was!” When the Trump administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, “Abuse of power — impeach him!”

Two key differences: there is actual evidence of former Vice President Joe Biden extorting the Ukrainian government; and Trump has released the transcript of his conversation with the new Ukrainian president. Only one administration has been transparent.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Friday called for a “word for word” transcript of President Trump’s conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky following closed-door briefings with intelligence officials.

The Senate Intelligence Committee member met with acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire and the intelligence community’s inspector general Michael Atkinson on Thursday and concluded that the whistleblower’s complaint – which is based entirely on hearsay – indicates that an “official word-for-word transcript of the call” exists.

“If so, it should be provided to Congress for review. Congress has a constitutional oversight duty. It’s important that we understand who took actions to hide details of the call with Zelensky and how high those actions reached,” Feinstein said, according to the Hill.

She added that she found the complaint “highly credible.”

“It suggests that the president used his office to demand political favors from a foreign country and that White House personnel knew this was wrong and tried to cover it up by burying details of the call with Ukrainian President Zelensky,” Feinstein stated.

Feinstein’s call comes days after Trump’s authorization to release the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of the conversation, which was done on Wednesday. The conversation showed no quid pro quo or pressure, as several GOP lawmakers made abundantly clear.

“President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating ‘Crowdstrike’ (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond ‘Crowdstrike,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a statement following the transcript’s release.

“Only thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden’s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son,” he continued.

“I’ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said in a statement.

“The Ukrainian President admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further,” he added.

“Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote. “This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!”

Feinstein’s call also follows a flurry of remarks from “transcript truthers” – including several high-profile Hollywood leftists – who “spread a host of conspiracy theories involving the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky,” as Breitbart News detailed:

“We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100 percent confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election,” she stated.

“That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale,” she added."

The president commented on the hearing after leaving New York City to return to the White House in Washington, DC, after spending several days attending meetings with world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly.

Trump appeared to be in a good mood.

Earlier in the day, he hosted a fundraising reception with donors, calling the Democrats’ rush to impeachment “the greatest thing that has ever happened to the Republican Party,” according to an attendee speaking to the Washington Post. Trump waved a transcript of the call with the Ukranian president as the group shouted “four more years.”

“If you really want their heads to explode, you should chant eight more years,” he said. They did.

House Democrats led by Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced their intention to impeach the president based on reports of a whistleblower highlighting a deeply troubling conversation with the Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The White House released a transcript of the conversation, which included Trump’s request that the Ukrainians investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, but there was no evidence of a “quid pro quo” nature.

But Schiff tried to colorize the conversation in a hearing with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to sound like a mafia movie, emphasizing what he believed was a direct threat to the Ukrainian president.

“This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate,” Schiff insisted, employing rhetoric that was not included in the transcript of the conversation.

Trump further mocked Schiff on Twitter.

“Liddle’ Adam Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had second-hand information, ‘is credible,’” Trump wrote. “How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!”

Schiff’s performance also drew ridicule from his Republican colleagues in the House.

“Sometimes fiction is better than the actual words or the text,” said Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH). “But luckily the American people are smart.”

Trump has eyed Schiff in the past as a partisan but smart rival in Washington, DC.

During a press conference on Wednesday, Trump accused “little” Schiff of being incredibly vicious in public statements.

“When you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic — smart guy, by the way — stand at the mic and act like he’s so serious. And then he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off,” Trump said.

But the president appeared pleased by the results of the hearing after returning to the White House.

After shaking hands of supporters on one side of the sidewalk, he pumped his fist and entered the White House without speaking to reporters."

The tweet, which cites ABC News as a source, has since proven false, with ABC News correcting its original reporting. Messing hasn’t deleted her tweet.

Musician Mikel Jollett from the band Airborne Toxic Event tweeted as fact that the White House secretly edited the transcript.

“How fucking stupid do you have to be to edit the transcript of the call and STILL end up including hardcore evidence that you committed an impeachable crime?” he wrote.

Burchett: Do-Nothing Democrat’s Trump Impeachment Inquiry a ‘Three-Ring Circus’,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/27/rep-burchett-do-nothing-democrats-trump-impeachment-inquiry-a-three-ring-circus/,"Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said on Thursday that Democrats do not care about getting the people’s business done and that the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is a “three-ring circus.”

He also thinks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has long resisted the call for an impeachment inquiry, is just caving to pressure from the extreme left of her Party, specifically the “squad” consisting of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

“I don’t think anything’s really changed at all, actually,” Burchett said on National Public Radio’s (NPR) All Things Considered. “I’m still opposed to the impeachment inquiry.”

“I think Speaker Pelosi is – I realize she’s got to yield to her very liberal base, and they’re four ladies who have a great deal of control,” Burchett said.

Burchett said that it wouldn’t have been left to a whistleblower if Trump had done something criminal on his phone call with the Ukrainian president that included a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I think if you just read the transcript of the conversation – I mean, you have to ask yourself why there’s more than a dozen people who had firsthand knowledge of that conversation who were there monitoring it and none of them have come forward to say that there was a problem with it,” Burchett said.

NPR host Audie Cornish implied in her interview with Burchett that Republicans were shifting their view of Trump because of the latest accusation against him but Burchett pointed out that one outspoken Republican is the failed presidential candidate and Trump critic Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT).

“Now, many of your Republican colleagues have been talking about their concerns,” Cornish said. “Do you see any shift happening?”

“No, ma’am. I don’t,” Burchett said. “I think that you’re talking about, apparently, an unnamed U.S. senator, but I think he’s just a disgruntled person who ran for president and didn’t…”

“So you’re referring to Senator Mitt Romney,” Cornish said.

“Yes, of course. Yes, ma’am,” Burchett said. “He didn’t get appointed to a position. It’s clearly spoiled milk.”

Cornish asked if Burchett had any questions about Trump’s phone conversation.

“Well, I would like to question Mr. Schiff why he opened up – this is a very serious accusation, and it’s very disrupting to the process because we’re not doing anything,” Burchett said. “We’re not addressing any of the concerns that people have – health care, immigration.”

Burchett said the new charges against Trump are the same as the now-failed Russian collusion charges.

“Nothing has changed,” Burchett said. “It’s – frankly, it’s a three-ring circus.”

“It’s the same committee,” Burchett said. “It’s the same people, ma’am.”

“And it’s the same, and they’re going to draw the same conclusion,” Burchett said. “If there’s – this is not an impeachable offense.”

“The committee that meets is the same committee that’s been meeting since I was first elected, and they have not done one dadgum thing productive out of that committee that they’ve been assigned to do,” Burchett said. “They’ve just been hearing over this and rehashing old things.”

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

The Economist has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

MIKE MURPHY: No, the old theory on impeachment was that it would help the Republicans. I think that’s out the window now. This is a much clearer incident than the Mueller report information. When the president released this transcript, you really have to parse your way through it to eliminate all subtext of no quid pro quo.

I agree that it doesn’t have to be a quid pro quo, but look at the context. The aid to Ukraine, the defense and military aid, was held up, the president of Ukraine asked for anti-tank missiles because he’s got a problem with Russian mercenary tanks, and the president says “let me talk to you about some other things, you know I’m a great friend to Ukraine, but it hasn’t really been paid back. Let’s get into this Biden matter.”

It’s a classic shake-down. That’s going to be the argument. And I’m telling you, these Senate Republicans, should the Democrats vote impeachment, which is far more likely than not, are going to be pinned down to a yes-no answer. And if they provide cover for Donald Trump for this, a clear violation of his role as president, we’re going to lose [the Senate race in] Colorado with Cory Gardner. We’re going to lose Maine with Susan Collins. We’re going to lose Arizona with Martha McSally. And the Democrats will put the Senate very much in play… One Republican senator told me if it was a secret vote, 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump."

Many congressional Democrats publicly declared it the “smoking gun,” while Republicans dismissed their cries by noting the absence of quid pro quo or generally lawless behavior.

However, Democrats are striking a drastically different tone privately, as several reports indicate.

The far-left flank of the Democrat caucus forced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to concede and announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president on Tuesday. She made the announcement prior to the release of the transcript, which detailed the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

As Republican lawmakers explicitly noted, the conversation contained “zero” grounds for a legitimate impeachment inquiry. The president’s request for a “favor,” Republicans added, was immediately followed by a reference to Crowdstrike and questions revolving around election meddling and hacking efforts. Joe Biden’s (D) son, Hunter Biden, was not mentioned until later in the conversation.

“President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating ‘Crowdstrike’ (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelensky, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond ‘Crowdstrike,'” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a statement, noting that Biden’s “possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son” was not mentioned until after the fact.

“Just read transcript of POTUS’ call w/Ukraine Pres. Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote. “This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!”

“Wow. Impeachment over this?” Rep Lindsey Graham (R-SC) expressed. “What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.”

Publicly, Democrats have claimed that the transcript is the “smoking gun,” accusing Trump of betrayal and calling him a “cheat,” while repeatedly taking the lines from the conversation out of context, attributing the “favor” to Biden’s son:

“I would like you to do us a favor”…”whatever you can do with [Barr] would be great.” This #UkraineTranscript is @realDonaldTrump’s version and he admitted to betrayal. America is too great of a country to be led by such a cheat. #ImpeachTrump — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) September 25, 2019

The transcript of the call reads like a classic mob shakedown: – We do a lot for Ukraine

– There’s not much reciprocity

– I have a favor to ask

– Investigate my opponent

– My people will be in touch Nice country you got there. It would be a shame if something happened to her. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 25, 2019

However, the public calls are overshadowed by reports of internal freakouts among Democrats, who believe this is a losing battle. As Breitbart News reported, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed hesitation and concern over the party’s decision to pull the trigger on impeachment. One senior Democrat congressional aide called the impeachment effort “a joke” and “all bullshit”:

Privately, several aides to top Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed concerns about the lack of a focus on the impeachment move; without a clear outcome in mind, Democrats fear that whatever happens will further energize Trump ahead of the 2020 election while failing to remove him. “If you’re going to take a shot at the king, you best not miss,” one House Democrat leadership aide told Breitbart News. “And we do not have a pathway to win without 20 GOP votes in the Senate. We are nowhere near that, not even close.” Another senior Democrat congressional aide added regarding the move to attempt to impeach Trump: “It’s a joke. It’s all bullshit.” Over on the Senate side, most Republicans are in line with Trump. While Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said that he considers the transcript’s contents “troubling,” he declined to discuss “impeachment” at this time.

Politico paralleled those sentiments, noting the “creeping anxiety throughout the party [that] it [impeachment] might only help the president clinch a second term.” The outlet spoke to several Democrat officials, who expressed that impeachment could very well backfire on Democrats.

“Of course, I want impeachment from a moral perspective,” Pete Buttigieg’s former New Hampshire director Michael Ceraso told Politico. “But from a political perspective, I don’t want to spend a year talking about how Democrats tried to impeach him and couldn’t pull it off.”

Instead of health care and kitchen-table economics — the issues the party ran on in last year’s blue-wave election — the campaign will inevitably be consumed by a doomed effort to boot Trump from office, skeptics say. All when Trump will be on the ballot in a matter of months, anyway “The Democrats become single-issue candidates, which weakens them,” Ceraso said, adding that the proceedings will only solidify Trump’s base.

Another Democrat strategist told Politico that Pelosi should have taken “one for the team” as she has been doing for months, rather than succumbing to the left’s call for an impeachment inquiry:

One Democratic strategist familiar with multiple presidential campaigns in Iowa said the party’s eventual nominee would be better served if House Democrats decline to open proceedings, even as candidates publicly urge them to. He reacted with alarm as Pelosi signaled Monday that she had become more open to the possibility of impeachment. “She needs to take one for the team and say, ‘Nope, we’re not doing it,’” the strategist said, before Pelosi greenlighted an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Another Democratic strategist with ties to the national party agreed. Holding the earlier Democratic line — with Democratic presidential candidates calling for impeachment and Pelosi declining to go there — would also help vulnerable Democratic House members with their reelection bids. “I think that works well for both Congress and the candidate because then [House members] can say they stand against the nominee,” the strategist said.

Even Sean Bagniewski, chairman of Iowa’s Polk County Democrats, signaled that Iowans at the Polk County Steak Fry did not have an appetite for impeachment.

“I talked to a lot of people, and it didn’t come up once, not at all,” he told Politico. “I’m sure it really energizes Twitter, but Twitter doesn’t vote.”

Bagniewski suggested that the endless impeachment efforts are distracting Democrats from issues that voters care about.

“The bread-and-butter issues are more important now than ever,” Bagniewski told Politico. “We all need to start deciding what we want to be spending our time on.”

His concerns are not isolated. The Democrat-led House has faced criticism for appearing to spend more time passing relatively meaningless resolutions while only paying lip service to “bread and butter” issues on their social media platforms.

Politico also cited Democrat strategist Hank Sheinkopf – who called impeachment a “national spectacle” – and Democratic National Committee member Bob Mulholland, who called impeachment a “political disaster for us Democrats”:

“It’s a national spectacle that will make people defend the presidency or tune out, which is worse,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic strategist based in New York. “The incessant banging about it doesn’t help. Stick with issues that work.” Bob Mulholland, a Democratic National Committee member from California, put it this way: “Absent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.”

Political analyst Charlie Cook noted that he was “totally underwhelmed by the transcript” and added that it will not help Democrats in their efforts to get Americans on board with impeaching the president:

I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters. — Charlie Cook (@CharlieCookDC) September 25, 2019

Even presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) went against the outspoken cries from her party, admitting that the transcript does not demonstrate a “compelling case” for impeachment:

As the fallout continues, Democrats are moving the goalposts, claiming that there no longer needs to be “no quid pro quo,” as Juan Williams concluded on Fox News’s The Five on Wednesday.

Despite the public cries of victory from certain Democrat lawmakers, Republicans smell blood.

Breitbart News reported:

“The Democrats are fucked,” a senior Senate GOP aide told Breitbart News upon reviewing the transcript. “This is going to unite everyone except maybe Mitt, I bet even Ben Sasse comes around on this and backs the president unless there’s some bombshell with the whistleblower who didn’t even hear this call. Republican operatives I’ve talked to are giddy about this.”

GOP lawmakers are using the left’s hysteria to their advantage, reminding the American people of the issues Democrats are ignoring – health care, border security, and homelessness – whilst distracting themselves with the endless list of grievances designed to take the president down:

As I travel across West Virginia, I talk to folks who are sick and tired of this purely partisan investigation aimed at reversing the results of the presidential election.

– It was the Ukrainian President who brought up Giuliani on the call AND – Democrats don't wait for the facts before they jump to conclusions when it comes to President @realdonaldtrump — Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) September 25, 2019

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) reminded the American people that Democrats have been actively searching for a catalyst to launch an impeachment inquiry since Trump’s inauguration.

“Since the day President Trump was elected, congressional Democrats have been working to find any reason under the sun to impeach the president and undo the results of the last election,” Cruz stated.

“First, it was Mueller, then the Mueller report found no collusion. Now it’s Ukraine. Next month, it will be something else,” he continued.

He added that “facts don’t matter to congressional Democrats” and predicted that Pelosi will “continue to be hounded by the far left of her caucus to halt all other legislative work to focus on attacking the president.”

As Breitbart News reported, Pelosi’s cave demonstrates that she lost the battle for control of her caucus, succumbing to the demands of the far-left “Squad.”

Additionally, the Trump campaign and RNC’s announcement of a combined $5 million raised since Pelosi’s initial launch of the impeachment inquiry essentially confirms the Democrat insiders’ mounting fears: The American public is not on board with impeachment, and the GOP – including Trump’s base – is ready for war."

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."

By the way, having hundreds of millions of dollars in aid held up. Could you explain why this is wrong and also extremely dangerous.

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: I fully appreciate the need for a President of the United States to have conversations with leaders of other countries and some of that may want to be held close to the vest as part of his job. But, I don’t think it’s part of his job to shakedown leaders of other countries using taxpayer dollars to have them do something that is in his political benefit. It’s wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and you have the President of the United States asking for that. Now we’re engaged in a cover-up of that cover-up. Two wrongs do not make a right and they know how wrong it is.

I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way. We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100% confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election. That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale."

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The possible super PAC is far from operational, but Larry Rasky, a former Biden aide, has led the effort to stand up an outside group that he believes would help the former vice president rebut attacks that could impact Biden's standing in the crowded and contentious Democratic primary. While Biden is still seen as a front-runner in the race, recent polling has shown his once-large lead slipping as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rises in the field

""For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,"" Rasky said. He added that he has begun to think ""the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we'd need to fight this.""

""The campaign is fighting a war on two fronts -- the primary and the general election -- at the same time. They certainly need all the support they can get.""

News of the super PAC, which was first reported by The New York Times , was not welcome inside Biden's campaign. Biden's team, from the outset of his presidential bid, has said they would disavow any outside spending on the former vice president's behalf. This case is no different. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, reiterated Friday that the campaign would reject any help from outside super PACs.

""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" Ducklo said. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.""

A source familiar with the internal Biden campaign strategy, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the outside effort, put a finer point on it.

""The campaign had its best week of fundraising since the second week after launching, and it would be impossible to miss from anywhere on earth that Donald Trump is panicked about Joe Biden,"" the source said. ""The campaign doesn't need or want this effort, and anyone engaging in it doesn't have its best interests at heart.""

Rasky said he expected that his prospective effort would be disavowed by the campaign, but he and others still believe the outside group is needed to rebut attacks leveled by Trump and other Republicans.

""We are dead serious about the need to do it,"" Rasky said. ""But we are also mindful of the campaign's position and the Vice President's expressed desire not to have one. That is a lot for us to ponder.""

Biden's campaign is not the first to have a super PAC considering spending on its behalf. A super PAC ran ads in support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee during his now-ended presidential bid. And top Democratic donors considered launching a super PAC to help New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this year. Booker did not back the effort.

A source close to the possible super PAC said that while its focus would be to respond to attacks from Trump and other Republicans, they would not rule out responding to Democratic attacks on Biden.

""That's not what it is for,"" the source said, ""but if Biden is attacked, we need to defend him."""

Although Trump released a transcript from his call with Zelensky which did not show he sought to create a quid pro quo with Ukraine, Pelosi accused Trump of using “taxpayer dollars to shake down” Ukraine for his own gain.

“I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” Pelosi stated.

Pelosi went on to speak about how “proud” she is of House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who fabricated a conversation between Trump and Zelensky during his opening statement at a committee hearing on the matter the day before.

UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IS PUBLIC! It is ALL rumor, gossip, hearsay. NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING! I recommend reading it. In the alternative, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a picture that fully describes the whistleblower & his report. Mo pic.twitter.com/OYHmoRpUgv — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) September 26, 2019

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. on Thursday at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Brooks elaborated on his feelings about the allegations, which he said could be tied to 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) supporters.

“Elizabeth Warren in my judgment is just about guaranteed to be the Democrat nominee for president, OK?” Brooks said. “And there’s probably a number of people who support Elizabeth Warren that in part were either behind the disclosure of this information or are currently promoting it today in order to enhance Elizabeth Warren’s stature vis-à-vis, Joe Biden.”

According to the Alabama Republican, Warren meets the requirements of the modern Democratic Party in both identity and ideology.

“Let’s look at who Joe Biden is, OK?” he continued. “He is a white male who is a liberal. In today’s Democratic Party, that doesn’t cut it. On a sexist level, the Democratic Party basically says we want women, not men. And Joe Biden is a man. So that doesn’t fit that identity politics item that the Democrat Party fosters on the American people. Additionally, Joe Biden is a mere liberal. The Democrats of today insist on pure socialist.”

“And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, the third principle argument that they use is based on race,” Brooks added. “They are opposed generally to the election or nomination of Caucasians. And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, she’s claimed that she’s a Native American.”

Those criteria, according to Brooks are who Democrat voters want representing their party on the ballot.

“Those are their three themes, and those are the three themes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to beat a 20-year white male liberal incumbent congressman in New York.”

There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong.

The whistleblower

An anonymous government worker - with access to White House officials - who filed an official complaint against the President claiming that multiple officials had concerns that Trump was using his public office to seek personal political gain from a foreign power not just through his July 25 phone conversation with Zelensky but through emissaries including Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as, possibly, Attorney General Bill Barr. The complaint also alleges a coverup by White House staffers who sought to bury Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President by placing a rough transcript of it in a computer system reserved for highly classified material.

Donald Trump, President of the United States

Just as he was trying to move on from allegations his campaign colluded with Russians against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Trump was ramping up efforts to get Ukraine to stir up trouble for his prospective 2020 challenger Biden. He used official channels to ask the Ukrainian President to look into the Biden family, openly asking Zelensky for a favor during a phone call on July 25 and then suggested his attorney meet with Ukrainian officials. In the July 25 phone call, the Ukrainian President mentioned plans to buy US-made Javelin missiles -- which he needs to help guard against potential Russian provocations. At the very same time, Trump was sitting on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, which he has argued was on hold while he leaned on European countries to give more to Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine

Here is Zelensky shooting the television series ""Servant of the People"" where he plays the role of the President of Ukraine. He was later elected President of Ukraine.

A comedian turned politician, Zelensky's job before being elected the President of Ukraine was playing the President of Ukraine on television. His country is in the midst of a years-long standoff with Russia over Crimea, an area Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. Zelensky is also dealing with a war against pro-Russian separatists. But his intentions -- and whether he is pro-Russian or pro-West -- have been something both sides have been trying to determine. His desire for military aid from the US is unquestioned. He flattered Trump during their phone call in July and promised a fair look at the Biden family after Trump asked for an investigation. But Zelensky clearly does not want to get involved in US politics , and said after the White House released its transcript of the July 25 call that he didn't think his side would be included.

Rudy Giuliani, Trump attorney

Giuliani drove Trump's focus on Ukraine and the Bidens.

The former New York mayor, now the President's personal attorney and staunch defender on cable news, is at the center of the Ukraine scandal . He has said he went to Ukraine because was trying to undermine the beginnings of the Russia investigation and protect Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for tax fraud linked to his business dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has said he then pivoted after learning about claims concerning Joe Biden's actions as Vice President, including his public calls in 2016 for a prosecutor in Ukraine to be fired. Giuliani claims that was improper because, at the time, Biden's son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company that had once been under investigation in Ukraine. After pushing the story about Biden for months, Giuliani ultimately met with a top aide to Zelensky in Madrid, days after the July 25 phone call where Trump asked Zelensky to hear Giuliani out.

William Barr, US attorney general

Barr has remained quiet on the Ukraine scandal, but he was mentioned repeatedly by Trump in the July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

Barr took over as head of the Department of Justice in February 2019, and oversaw the official release of the Mueller report summing up the government's investigation into claims that Russia engaged with the Trump campaign to tamper with the 2016 election. Trump asked the Ukrainian President to talk with Barr as part of an investigation he said Barr was conducting. Barr has remained quiet about any involvement in Ukraine, but Democrats have said they expect him to be called to testify

Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of state

Mike Pompeo is not mentioned by name in the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by House Democrats.

Mike Pence, vice president of the US

When Trump could not attend a meeting with Zelensky in September, he sent Pence instead.

When Trump canceled a September trip to Poland during which he was supposed to meet with Zelensky, Pence went instead. The vice president told reporters after the meeting that he did not discuss Biden, but that he talked to Zelensky in great detail about Trump's interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and also about US aid to Ukraine.

Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire faced scrutiny about the whistleblower complaint on Capitol Hill.

A retired vice admiral and former Navy SEAL, Maguire stepped into his role when former DNI Dan Coats resigned in August. Maguire initially withheld the whistleblower complaint from Congress because his attorneys counseled him that Trump was not part of the intelligence community. Weeks into the job, he's already been called to testify before Congress over the Ukraine scandal. In that congressional testimony he defended the whistleblower for coming forward.

Pat Cipollone, White House counsel

Pat Cipollone has been White House counsel since 2018.

Alongside the allegations about Trump's effort to influence the Ukrainian President against Biden are the whistleblower's allegation that White House lawyers sought to cover things up by burying the transcript of the call in a server reserved for highly classified information. Cipollone, as White House counsel, was also involved in the recommendation that Maguire should withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress, according to the Washington Post

Adam Schiff, House Intelligence Committee Chairman

Schiff's intelligence committee will likely lead the most visible impeachment inquiry.

A former federal prosecutor, Schiff is a confidant of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has designated the California congressman to take the lead in the Democrats' inquiry into the whistleblower complaint. He is a frequent target of Trump, who refers to him as ""liddle"" Adam Schiff.

Devin Nunes, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member

Nunes has been one of Trump's most vocal supporters.

If Schiff is the prosecutor, Nunes -- also from California -- will play the role of Trump's defender. Long an apologist for the President on the Russia investigation, Nunes has pivoted to defending Trump on Ukraine. With his seat next to Schiff, he will play an important role.

Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives

Pelosi had been cool to pursuing impeachment until the whistleblower story broke.

Pelosi is in her second stint as the top elected Democrat in the country, and nothing will move forward on impeachment without her support. After months of slowing calls by Democrats for impeachment proceedings over the findings of the Mueller report, Pelosi quickly moved to change course and begin official impeachment proceedings after the substance of Trump's Ukraine actions as detailed in the whistleblower complaint became clear.

Yuriy Lutsenko, former Ukrainian General Prosecutor

The former top prosecutor in Ukraine, Lustenko had complained about the US ambassador.

A holdover from the administration that preceded Zelensky in Ukraine, Lutsenko was Giuliani's original target to influence toward an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma. Lutsenko said in May he had looked to reanimate the investigation, but also that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. His comments to a reporter for The Hill that there should be an investigation into whether Ukrainians had meddled in the 2016 US election may have helped fuel Giuliani's focus on Ukraine. He resigned in August.

Viktor Shokin, former Ukraine prosecutor general

Biden, along with other Western officials, wanted Shokin fired back in 2016.

Shokin was named Ukraine's top prosecutor under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in 2015 and began facing criticism for what was seen as an unwillingness to prosecute elite corruption. Biden, who handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration, put public and private pressure on the Ukraine government to fire Shokin. The Obama administration threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Poroshenko took action. Trump has seized on this to accuse Biden of wrongdoing -- despite no evidence of this -- and the international calls for Shokin's firing at the time. The Ukraine legislature voted to oust Shokin in March 2016. Biden's last visit to Ukraine before Shokin's firing was in December 2015, though he held a phone call with Poroshenko before the dismissal.

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman

Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas (second and third from left) are associates of Rudy Giuliani and were charged with violating campaign finance laws.

Soviet-born American associates of Giuliani who helped him in Ukraine but also had business interests there, Fruman and Parnas were arrested on campaign finance violation allegations in the US. It has since been reported by CNN that federal authorities are scrutinizing their business ties to Giuliani. Their alleged campaign finance misdeeds include making campaign contributions using so-called ""straw donors."" They donated $325,000 to a Trump-aligned super PAC in 2018 and have put pictures of themselves with the President on social media. The super PAC, America First ACTION, said in a statement it never spent the money.

Vladimir Putin, President of Russia

Putin's Russia annexed Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine, in 2014.

Putin is not directly related to the whistleblower complaint, but his shadow looms over this entire story and generally over Trump's presidency. The reason Zelensky and Ukraine want the military aid is their standoff with Russia over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Andriy Yermak, aide to Ukrainian President

A top adviser to Zelensky, Yermak met with Giuliani in Madrid a week after Trump's call with Zelensky. According to the whistleblower complaint, various US officials said this meeting was a ""direct follow-up"" to the July 25th call.

T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department Counselor

A West Point classmate and business partner of Pompeo, Brechbuhl is mentioned in the complaint as having listened to Trump's call with Zelensky as it occurred. The State Department has denied he listened in.

Kurt Volker, US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations

Kurt Volker is the administration's point person on Ukraine.

Formerly the administration's point person on Ukraine, Volker is a key figure in this story. He's mentioned in the whistleblower complaint as trying to advise Ukrainian officials on how to deal with Trump and Giuliani. It was Volker who apparently set up the meeting between Giuliani and Yerkmak, Zelensky's aide. He was essentially a volunteer, however, and still works for BGR group, a Washington lobbying firm that has represented the government of Ukraine. Volker resigned his position and was the first witness called by House investigators in their impeachment probe. Text messages he gave three House committees showed concern among diplomats that the Trump administration was withholding funding over Trump's demands for an investigation of his political rivals.

Gordon Sondland, United States Ambassador to the EU

Sonland is mentioned in the Whistleblower complaint alongside Volker.

Mentioned in the complaint alongside Volker, the two were said by the whistleblower to be advising the Ukrainian leadership about how to deal with Trump and Giuliani. In text messages released by Volker , Sonalnd tells a US diplomat concerned the President is withholding funding in exchange for an investigation that he is mistaken about the President's intentions.

William B. Taylor, chargé d'affaires for US Embassy in Ukraine

Taylor was ambassador to Ukraine during the George W. Bush administration, but after some posting in Washington and the Middle East, is back at the embassy in a different role. After the recall of Yovanovitch, he was intimately involved in talks between Volker, Sondland and Zelensky's aides. He repeatedly raised concerns in text messages that the administration was withholding funding in exchange for an investigation of Trump's political rivals.

Marie Yovanovitch, former US Ambassador to Ukraine

Trump said the former ambassador to Ukraine, whom his administration recalled, was ""bad news.""

After complaints by Lutsenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor, and Republicans in the US, Yovanovitch was recalled from her post. A career member of the foreign service who has served in ambassadorships under three presidents, she was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016 and recalled in May 2019, prompting Democrats to accuse the White House of a "" political hit job ."" In the phone call with Zelensky, Trump disparaged her, calling her ""bad news"" and saying, ""she's going to go through some things."" In damning testimony on Capitol Hill , Yovanovitch said it was her understanding she was targeted by Giuliani and she issued a dire warning about diplomacy during the Trump administration.

George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State

career foreign service officer , he is now the top policy official for Eurasia, including Ukraine. He was number two in the US embassy to Ukraine from 2015 to 2018, so his experience there spans time under Trump, as well as when then-Vice President Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to do more to combat corruption.

Fiona Hill, former top White House Russia adviser

A notable critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hill officially resigned from her position with the National Security Council as Trump's top Russia policy adviser in August. She is mentioned in text messages given to House Democrats as part of the impeachment inquiry by former US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker.

John Durham, US Attorney for District of Connecticut

US attorney John Durham was brought in by Barr to lead an after-action probe of the Russia investigation.

Mentioned in the whistleblower complaint because he was tapped by Barr to lead a probe into the beginnings of the Russia investigation and, according to the DOJ, was investigating Ukraine.

Michael Atkinson, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community

The whistleblower complaint was originally delivered to Michael Atkinson.

As ICIG, Atkinson was the first to receive the whistleblower complaint . He informed Congress that it was initially being withheld from the House Intelligence committee despite his determination that it represented an ""urgent concern."" He told the committee he was at an ""impasse"" with Maguire over the complaint and whether Congress should be informed about its existence or its contents. He was appointed to his position by Trump after many years at the Department of Justice.

Stephen Engel, Director, Office of Legal Counsel

A top attorney at the Department of Justice, it was Engel's job to review whether the whistleblower complaint was an ""urgent concern"" from the perspective of the DOJ. He recommended keeping the complaint at the DOJ for a possible criminal probe instead of sending to Congress, as the law would seem to require. That set up the showdown between Atkinson, the inspector general and Maguire, the acting DNI.

General counsel at an intelligence agency

Even before the whistleblower filed the complaint, the White House was aware of the whistleblower's concerns because an intelligence agency's general counsel notified lawyers at the Justice Department and the White House after the whistleblower flagged them through an anonymous process, according to The New York Times

John Eisenberg, a deputy White House counsel

The first person at the White House notified about concerns ultimately raised by the whistleblower. He and the intelligence agency's general counsel contacted the Justice Department together, according to The Times

John Demers, head of the Justice Department's national security division; Jeffrey Rosen, deputy attorney general; Brian Benczkowski, head of DOJ criminal division

Demers was the first attorney at the DOJ notified of concerns about Trump's conduct raised by the whistleblower and discussed it with colleagues Rosen and Benczkowski at Department of Justice, according to The New York Times . It's not clear when or how Barr was notified.

Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, attorneys for the whistleblower

Bakaj worked in the CIA inspector general's office before being forced out in 2014. A subsequent report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general cleared him of any wrongdoing, according to Yahoo News . Now in private practice, Bakaj and Zaid, who work together on whistleblower and security clearance cases, are representing the whistleblower

The complainer admits, “I was not a direct witness to most of the events described.” Still, the so-called whistleblower goes on to allege that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

The transcript of the phone call authorized for release by President Trump evidences no such pressure or quid pro quo and shows the request to investigate alleged corruption involving Biden and his family was a small part of the call.

The “whistleblower” concedes that his information is based on secondhand knowledge: “However, I found my colleagues’ accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.”

One key section of the so-called whistleblower’s document claims that “multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.”

This was allegedly to follow up on Trump’s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the “cases” mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower’s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.

Even though the statement was written in first person – “multiple U.S. officials told me” – it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

That footnote reads:

In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.

The so-called whistleblower’s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:

Write that Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko “also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.”

Document that Trump adviser Rudi Giuliani “had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.”

Bolster the charge that, “I also learned from a U.S. official that ‘associates’ of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.” The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, “I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.”

The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a “joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.”

BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.

The OCCRP and BuzzFeed “joint investigation” resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump’s political rivals.

The so-called whistleblower’s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

“Two Unofficial US Operatives Reporting To Trump’s Lawyer Privately Lobbied A Foreign Government In A Bid To Help The President Win In 2020,” was the title of the BuzzFeed piece.

OCCRP’s article was titled, “Meet the Florida Duo Helping Giuliani Investigate for Trump in Ukraine.”

The charges in the articles seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower’s own claims.

Soros, Google, Omidyar Network

The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) describes itself as a “non-profit media organization providing an investigative reporting platform for the OCCRP Network.”

Using generalized phraseology, it states, “We now connect 45 non-profit investigative centers in 34 countries, scores of journalists and several major regional news organizations across Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.”

Every page of the OCCRP website features the same bottom section listing the icons of four of the organization’s top funders, including Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Indeed, OCCRP provides a hyperlink to the webpage for Soros’s Open Society at the bottom left corner of every page on OCCRP’s own website.

Soros’s Open Society was listed as the number two donor in most of the annual financial records posted on OCCRP’s website starting in 2012. Some years list Soros as the organization’s top donor.

OCCRP advertises its other funders, including Google, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the U.S. State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.

Together with Soros’s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are “disputed.”

Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute’s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros’ Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy.

The Omidyar Network has partnered with the Open Society on numerous projects and it has given grants to third parties using the Soros-funded Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to left-wing causes in the U.S.

And OCCRP seems to have gone to bat for Soros on several occasions.

One such example is an OCCRP article titled, “How Macedonia’s Scandal-plagued Nationalists Lobbied America’s Right and Pulled Them Into an Anti-Soros Crusade.”

That piece targeted Breitbart News as well as conservative groups and Republicans, claiming, “Conservative media outlets, such as Breitbart and Fox News, as well as the right-wing Heritage Foundation, have devoted considerable coverage to Soros’ alleged meddling in Macedonia.”

“And more than a dozen Republican congressmen have written critical letters questioning the U.S. embassy and Ambassador Jess Baily for working with Soros-linked NGOs.”

Macedonia has been a center of Soros’s action network, with the Open Society boasting in its literature that it spent some $98.7 million funding groups in Macedonia since 1992.

OCCRP has also repeatedly targeted Hungary’s nationalist government over its opposition to Soros-funded groups that Hungary accuses of meddling in internal affairs.

Soros Group and Fusion GPS

As first reported by the Daily Caller, IRS filings showed the Democracy Integrity Project, a nonprofit funded by Soros, in turn hired firms tied to Fusion GPS and anti-Trump dossier author Christopher Steele for more than $3.8 million in 2017.

The Daily Caller reported:

The group paid $3.3 million to Bean LLC., the holding company that controls Fusion GPS. Another $250,000 was paid to Walsingham Partners Ltd., a London-based firm owned by Steele and his partner, Christopher Burrows. TDIP paid another London-based intelligence firm called Istok Associates Ltd. nearly $150,000, also for “research consulting.” The company has released investigative reports looking into whether Russia helped fund the Brexit campaign. Nearly $130,000 was paid to Edward Austin Ltd., a London-based intelligence consultancy operated by Edward Baumgartner, a Fusion GPS contractor. Another $148,000 was paid to the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, which has represented Fusion GPS in a variety of dossier-related legal matters.

Questions Surround Biden Family Over Ukraine Dealings

In his phone call with Zelensky, meanwhile, Trump asked him to investigate Biden and his son, the transcript relates.

The transcript reads:

The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Entirely missing from much of the news media coverage is the larger context of the story, which spotlights significant questions about Biden’s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period where his son, Hunter Biden, received $50,000 a month from a natural gas company there.

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

Biden boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. Joe Biden claims no wrongdoing.

""Right now, I'd like to just see us do the Ukraine issue because it is so clear and it is such a clear violation of law,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the day after the release of a stunning whistleblower complaint about Trump and his conduct.

""The President is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally. That's against the law,"" she continued.

Warren's comments come as Democrats debate how broadly to draft articles of impeachment against the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private meeting on Wednesday that she wants to focus on Trump's conversations with Ukraine, according to several sources involved in the discussions. A resolution that is more broad could make it more complicated to get the necessary votes on the House floor, according to multiple Democratic sources.

But some Democrats who backed impeachment earlier on said they want the focus of the inquiry to include findings of potential obstruction of justice, saying Trump shouldn't be let off the hook for allegedly trying to thwart former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe . Others say the inquiry should address Trump's involvement in alleged hush-money payments to prevent stories of his alleged affairs from coming out before the 2016 election.

The whistleblower complaint detailed various ways in which the whistleblower believed Trump sought to ""solicit interference"" from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, including by encouraging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Hunter Biden's past. It also laid out an alleged pattern of efforts by the White House to cover up those attempts.

The White House released a transcript of a call between Trump and Zelensky, showing Trump repeatedly pushing his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. The transcript has drawn further scrutiny because it had been moved to a highly secure server. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

""They didn't leave that transcript in the regular course of transcripts of phone calls with foreign leaders. Why? Because it wasn't a regular call,"" Warren said. ""It was a call that violated the law. And so their immediate instinct is: Let's block it out. Let's make sure nobody can see it. Let's cover it up.""

On whether she believes any Senate Republicans would vote to convict Trump, Warren answered: ""I don't know.""

""I think everyone in Congress should be called on to vote,"" she added. ""Everyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then they should have to live with that vote forever.""

Warren, who has risen in recent polls and is running neck-and-neck with Joe Biden, said she hoped the impeachment process could be wrapped up before voting in the Democratic primary begins in February. She has called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings since April after the release of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Asked whether Hunter Biden's business dealings should be off limits in the 2020 campaign, Warren pivoted back to Trump.

""I believe that this issue is about Donald Trump and that's where we need to keep our focus,"" she said. ""He is the President of the United States and he has solicited a foreign government interfering in our 2020 election. That is a threat to democracy and it is a threat to our Constitution. That's where we need to focus.""

Warren also told CNN on Friday that she worries for the safety of the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown to the public. She said Trump and his administration are ""doing their best to try to cover this up and discredit anyone who's trying to get to the truth.""

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint and defended the whistleblower, saying the whistleblower ""did the right thing.""

Phil Scott on Thursday said he supports an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, making him the first GOP governor to do so and marking a notable departure from the largely party-line Republican response to a mounting Ukraine controversy.

""I support getting the facts in that inquiry that's happening today,"" Scott told CNN affiliate WCAX. ""So I think this is, these are serious allegations we need to -- we need to make sure that we do the fact finding and figure out what exactly did happen.""

While governors play no official role in an impeachment process, Scott's support for an inquiry joins a surging number of House Democrats who have come out in support for the politically divisive escalation in recent days as scrutiny over Trump's interactions with Ukraine has grown.

The controversy centers around a whistleblower complaint -- which was released publicly earlier Thursday -- that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up.

A rough transcript of a July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Specifically, Trump said that, ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" alleging that they received a ""payoff"" worth billions. Trump said that while he hasn't yet asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to look into the Bidens, he will start ""thinking about it.""

On Thursday, CNN reported that in a June call with Xi, Trump raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

In attacking the Bidens over the past few weeks, Trump has spent the majority of his time focusing on Ukraine , but he's also at times made vague allegations about the Bidens' ties to China. On several occasions, he has intimated that the Bidens have received millions of dollars from China, implying they capitalized on the then vice president's political power and connections.

We've already fact-checked the President's claims about the Bidens and Ukraine. Trump's latest allegations involving China are similarly misleading.

Facts First: There is no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden received money from China. Though when it comes to Biden's son Hunter, Trump's allegations are not thoroughly unfounded.

Here's what Trump has said:

During his remarks at the United Nations on September 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said, ""When Biden's son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can't get money out of China, and he's there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing."" Details on the deal that the President cited come from conservative author Peter Schweizer's newest book ""Secret Empires.""

A day later, in an exchange with reporters on September 26, Trump implicated the elder Biden in his allegations, saying, ""But Adam Schiff doesn't talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and then millions of dollars from China. Walking away, in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars.""

Here's what we know:

A company, whose board Hunter Biden sat on, received a large investment of Chinese capital shortly after Hunter Biden visited the country with his father.

According to the New York Times , Biden's son Hunter has a 10% interest in BHR Partners, a private-equity fund that the Chinese government-owned Bank of China has invested in. As of May 2019, both The New York Times and the Washington Post reported that Hunter had not received any money from the fund or in connection with his role as an unpaid advisory board member.

In July 2019, more than two years after his father left office, Hunter purchased an equity stake in the BHR fund, valued around $430,000, according to the Washington Post

After Trump's meeting with Zelensky at the United Nations, one of Hunter's lawyers told the Washington Post that, ""To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors.""

The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden's role with BHR.""

In December 2013, the same month the fund was officially established , Hunter joined his father and one of his daughters on a trip to China. There, Hunter met up with Jonathan Li, the fund's China-based partner. The New Yorker reported that Li met Hunter at his hotel and shook hands with the vice president. Days after the start of the trip, Hunter had officially joined BHR's board, the Washington Post reports , raising questions about whether he had used his father's access for his own personal benefit.

However, according to The New Yorker, Hunter maintains that visit with Li was social, not business-related.

Schweizer, who also wrote ""Clinton Cash,"" suggested in a May op-ed for the New York Post that the vice president was responsible for or helped influence what he claimed in ""Secret Empires"" was a $1.5 billion deal the fund made with the Bank of China, which was signed shortly after the Bidens' trip to China.

While Schweizer points to that handshake between Biden and Li as evidence that Hunter profited from his father's position, technically that's untrue as Hunter did not personally make any money until years after his father was no longer serving as vice president.

This story has been updated following Trump's October 3 comments."

Andy Biggs (R-AZ) on Friday introduced a motion to condemn and censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) for performing a fabricated conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his opening statement at a panel hearing Thursday morning.

“During yesterday’s hearing, Chairman Schiff’s opening statement included a blatantly false retelling of President Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Democrats previously initiated an impeachment inquiry, which leads to one of the most serious, constitutional duties of Members of Congress: removal of the President of the United States,” Biggs, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “Through this process, if the President has committed high crimes or misdemeanors, Congress may overturn the election of the President and the will of the American people. It is therefore inexcusable to toy with the process and mislead the American public with such a statement.”

Although the White House released Wednesday a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, Schiff made-up his own transcript that he read ahead of the testimony of acting DNI chief Joseph Maguire in which he accused the president of engaging in quid pro quo with the intent of exchanging U.S. military aid to Ukraine for an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

“We’ve been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don’t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from YOU though. And I’m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good,” said Schiff.

“I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it,” the congressman continued.

“And I’m gonna put you in touch with Rudy, you’re gonna love him, trust me,” Schiff said, still avoiding any real quotations from the transcript. “You know what I’m asking, so I’m only going to say this a few more times, in a few more ways. And by the way don’t call me again. I’ll call you when you’ve done what I’ve asked.”

“This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate,” he concluded.

On Friday, President Trump lambasted Schiff’s performance and demanded that he resign from Congress.

“Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist,” President Trump tweeted,

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,” the president added.

“Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,” he added. “He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

Although House Democrats claim the call — which is the subject of a partisan CIA officer’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint— shows a clear attempt by President Trump to invite Ukraine to meddle in U.S. affairs, Zelensky himself has dismissed their assertations, saying he never felt pressed by the president to investigate the Bidens.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky, flanked by the president, told reporters at the United Nations in New York City.

Nonetheless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), under pressure from progressive Democrats, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the call on Wednesday. Though House Democrats might be racing towards impeachment, the complaint-maker and his claims have already raised major red flags."

Maxine Waters (D-CA) gave her millennial supporters a “shout out” on Friday for “staying woke” and supporting her endless calls for impeachment throughout the months.

Waters’ “shout out” follows a week of impeachment drama in Congress, resulting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) caving and formally announcing an impeachment inquiry. Democrats used a “whistleblower” complaint – which is based entirely on hearsay, not firsthand knowledge – as a catalyst for their latest impeachment efforts.

Waters insisted on CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time on Thursday that Democrats have more than enough evidence to impeach President Trump, despite the transcript of the conversation between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky showing no quid pro quo:

CNN's @ChrisCuomo: ""Do you think you know enough at this point, congresswoman, to say there is enough here for articles of impeachment?"" Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters: ""Absolutely."" https://t.co/BQcV4uqgCs pic.twitter.com/Hey3HhDZMZ — Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 27, 2019

She doubled down on Friday, proclaiming during an interview with BuzzFeed’s AM2DM that Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General William Barr are part of a “conspiracy”:

Let me just say that Attorney General Barr has defined himself as being just the president’s lawyer, not the people’s lawyer that he’s supposed to be. [He’s] willing to do whatever it takes to protect the president. He’s not a credible human being. His name has come up in this whole issue about the president’s call and work that’s been done with Ukraine to try to pressure them and get information about Biden. I know, given what he’s done in the past, that he’s guilty in being involved by either assisting Giuliani or doing other kinds of things to try and get Ukraine’s president to come out and get dirt on Biden. … First of all, we have seen that no matter what the president does, they come up with a kind of messaging to defend him. No matter what it is, none of them have had the courage, the patriotism, or the guts to stand up for what is right for our country. So I expect that Pence is part of this conspiracy to try to get Ukraine to do something in a fake investigation and come out with some dirt on Biden. I’m looking forward to that coming out in the hearings that will be done by the Judiciary Committee as they take up the impeachment resolution.

Waters also revealed herself to be a “transcript truther,” writing, “Trump & his sycophants tried to cover up the transcripts re: his phone call to Ukraine’s president by hiding the info on a server reserved for highly classified info. It didn’t work.”

The White House on Wednesday released the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump related to the matter. The call summary showed that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate a potential 2020 political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The rough transcript led Democrats to accuse Trump of a quid pro quo, after media reports on Monday revealed Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine days ahead of his call with Zelensky.

Top Democrats concluded the call summary showed clear evidence of Trump pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage.

Trump denied any wrongdoing and argued that the call summary showed there was no direct quid pro quo — an argument that was echoed by his Republican allies in Congress.

""You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo,"" Trump said in a press conference Wednesday in New York after the rough transcript's release.

On Wednesday, McConnell had dismissed criticism as ""laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense,"" Politico reported.

""I've read the summary of the call. If this is the 'launching point' for House Democrats' impeachment process, they've already overplayed their hand,"" McConnell said in a statement provided to Politico. ""It's clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for.""

Whistleblower complaint

The July phone call was part of a whistleblower complaint that alleged Trump solicited interference from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election.

After reports of the whistleblower complaint emerged, Trump acknowledged that Biden was mentioned on the call with Zelensky and later revealed that he had withheld military aid from Ukraine.

He claimed the delay in aid was not related to the investigation request, but because he was waiting on European allies to pay their fair share.

McConnell on Tuesday said he was "" never given an explanation "" why the aid to Ukraine was held up even as he was pressing administration officials to release the aid at the time.

Before the July call summary's release, the President had suggested last Sunday that he was open to releasing the call transcript, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out.""

Some of Trump's top administration officials argued otherwise, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who said ""there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC News . ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances.""

But two days later, Trump pledged to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine.""

The whistleblower complaint, which was made public Thursday after demands from Democrats, alleged that White House officials tried to ""lock down"" all records of Trump's Ukraine phone call -- especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.

White House lawyers directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information, the whistleblower alleged.

The whistleblower said they heard from other White House officials that this was ""not the first time"" that the Trump administration used this storage system to hold politically sensitive documents. The codeword-level system is meant to hold files of national security importance.

The White House acknowledged Friday that the move to place the Ukraine call transcript in the system came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys."

Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as he has also done in the past.",2019-09-27,CNN,Fact check: Breaking down Adam Schiff's account of Trump's Ukraine call,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/fact-check-adam-schiff-trumps-ukraine-call/index.html,"Washington (CNN) In a tweet on Friday morning , President Donald Trump called for the resignation of Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as he has also done in the past.

""Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn't exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,"" Trump wrote. ""Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!""

We can't endorse Trump's claim that Schiff ""lied,"" since Schiff introduced his comments at Thursday's committee hearing by saying he would be outlining ""the essence of what the president communicates,"" not providing ""the exact transcribed version of the call."" And it's important to note that we do not even have an ""exact transcribed version"" of the call -- the rough transcript released by the White House cautions explicitly that it is ""not a verbatim transcript.""

Still, Schiff's remarks did make it easy for viewers to get confused. He did not make clear which words he was taking directly from Trump's comments in the rough transcript, which words were his own analysis, and which words were meant to be the comedic ""parody"" he later said he was intending.

At some points, Schiff's words strayed quite far from what the rough transcript showed Trump saying.

Given Schiff's prominent role at the high-profile Thursday hearing and in the Democrats' overall opposition to Trump as the party makes an impeachment push, it's worth taking a deep dive into what happened here.

What Schiff said about the call

Let's go quote by quote through the relevant part of Schiff's statement.

Schiff: ""President Zelensky, eager to establish himself at home as the friend of the president of the most powerful nation on earth, had at least two objectives: get a meeting with the president and get more military help. And so what happened on that call? Zelensky begins by ingratiating himself, and he tries to enlist the support of the president. He expresses his interest in meeting with the president, and says his country wants to acquire more weapons from us to defend itself.""

Analysis: This is an accurate summary. Zelensky complimented Trump, saying he had used ""quite a few of your skills and knowledge"" in his winning election campaign; urged Trump to ""call me more often"" and (later in the call) to visit Ukraine; and said Ukraine is ""almost ready"" to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States.

Schiff: ""And what is the President's response? Well, it reads like a classic organized crime shakedown.""

Analysis: This is a subjective matter of opinion.

Schiff: ""Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the President communicates. We've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here.""

Analysis: Schiff shifted here from his own voice to the voice of Trump. But this is a roughly accurate summary of what Trump said, though Schiff used slightly different words.

Trump said in the call, ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are."" Trump then said of the US-Ukraine relationship: ""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.""

Schiff: ""I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. And I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.""

Analysis: Here's where Schiff veered quite a distance from what the rough transcript says.

Trump did not repeat a demand related to a political opponent ""seven times,"" according to the rough transcript. He told Zelensky three times that he would get his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to call Zelensky. He twice mentioned Biden's effort to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, saying this is what he wanted Zelensky to look into. (The prosecutor was widely criticized for failing to prosecute corruption, and there is no evidence of Biden wrongdoing

Trump said in the call, ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" nearly identical to Schiff's version. But the next thing Trump said was not about Biden -- it was that he wanted Zelensky to look into something related to cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and ""the server,"" possibly referring to Democratic National Committee computers hacked by Russia in 2016.

Trump was alluding to a conspiracy theory; we explain here

Trump also did not tell Zelensky to ""make up dirt"" on Biden. Rather, Trump said in the call: ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me.""

As we have previously noted , Trump was himself inaccurate here: Biden has not boasted about having ""stopped the prosecution"" of a Ukrainian case in which his son Hunter Biden had an interest.

But Trump asked Zelensky in the call to ""look into"" his baseless claim about Biden, not to make things up.

Schiff's subtext

Schiff's team argues that there was a subtext here -- that asking Zelensky to dig into Biden was effectively asking him to ""make up dirt,"" since there is not actual Biden wrongdoing to be found.

Schiff: ""I'm going to put you in touch with people, and not just any people. I'm going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr. He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I'm going to put you in touch with Rudy.""

Analysis: Trump did tell Zelensky that he would have Giuliani and the attorney general, William Barr, call him.

Trump did not tell Zelensky that Barr has ""the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him,"" but this is obviously true of the attorney general.

Schiff: ""You're going to love him (Giuliani). Trust me. You know what I'm asking? And so I'm only going to say this a few more times in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked.""

Analysis: Trump did not tell Zelensky not to call him again until he had done what Trump asked, nor did he say ""you know what I'm asking?"" The call ended on a positive note, with Trump saying of Zelensky's request for a visit to Ukraine, ""Okay, we can work that out,"" then adding, ""I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.""

The whistleblower complaint alleges that Trump instructed Vice President Mike Pence to call off a planned trip to Ukraine, and alleges that it had been ""made clear"" to US officials that ""the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelensky until he saw how Zelensky 'chose to act' in office.""

Schiff: ""This is in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine. It would be funny if it wasn't such a graphic betrayal of the President's oath of office. But as it does represent a real betrayal, there's nothing the president says here that is in America's interest after all.""

Analysis: This concluding quote may have further confused viewers. Schiff suggested here that he had just provided listeners with what ""the president says,"" though he had added in things that Trump did not actually say.

A 'parody'?

Later in the hearing, Republican Rep. Mike Turner criticized Schiff's comments, saying that ""sometimes fiction is better than the actual words or the text.""

""But luckily the American public are smart,"" Turner said. ""They have the transcript. They've read the conversation. They know when someone's just making it up.""

Schiff responded by saying that his summary of Trump's call was ""meant to be at least part in parody,"" a claim Trump's campaign also criticized . Schiff had not clearly distinguished the serious parts of his analysis from the supposed ""parody.""

Schiff's post-hearing response

Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday whether he regretted saying what he did, Schiff said, ""No, I think everyone understood -- and my GOP colleagues may feign otherwise. But when I said, suggested, that it was as if the President said, 'Listen carefully, because I'm only gonna tell you seven more times' -- that I was mocking the President's conduct.""

Schiff continued to stand by the comments on Friday morning.

""It was entirely clear in context of Chairman Schiff's opening statement that he was not misleading anyone. He began that portion of his statement by saying, 'In essence, what the President Trump communicates is this,' and then proceeded to describe, accurately, the message the President communicated on the call,"" Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland said in an email.

Boland added: ""When his Republican colleagues suggested they had been confused about that portion, he clarified further that he was not reading the transcript. The suggestions that he was misleading gives credence to the absurd attacks from the President and his allies in their desperate effort to distract from their wrongdoing."""

Forty-five years after Watergate , 20 years after Bill Clinton's shame, the mechanism of impeachment is again grinding into life in Washington. The attempt by Democrats to oust a defiant President Donald Trump seems likely, given already bitter divides, to pour even more poison into the nation's political soul than those previous two impeachment dramas.

Unlike the complicated and confusing picture of shady dealings with Russians and potential obstruction painted by special counsel Robert Mueller, the questions pending in the new showdown are clear cut -- a factor that adds to the President's political vulnerability.

Did Trump abuse his power by leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer military aid to pressure a foreign country to damage a political opponent? And did the White House then engage in an effort to cover it up?

""The President of the United States has betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security, and betrayed his oath to defend our constitution,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Thursday.

The whistleblower complaint against Trump regarding his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is a ""roadmap,"" Schiff said. The document's accusations of a cover-up opens up several key Trump allies to interrogation, such as lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, and it alludes to possible other instances where records were kept secret for political purposes.

Already, 219 House Democrats -- more than half of the 435 members -- have publicly stated support for impeachment proceedings, according to CNN's count.

The character of the Republican defense of the President is clear as well. GOP lawmakers and supporters are already seeking to discredit what appears to be strong documentary evidence of pressure by Trump on Zelensky. And the White House frames impeachment as another gross attack by Democrats on Trump, a President who they say viewed as illegitimate ever since his 2016 victory.

""What these guys are doing, Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace, and it shouldn't be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it,"" Trump said, of the constitutional process of checks and balances, in a fiery statement on the airport tarmac after returning from New York on Thursday.

Washington transformed in a matter of days

On Monday, Washington showed up to work expecting most of the week's drama to unfold around Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Yet, seemingly in the blink of an eye, life changed profoundly for the President, a Democratic House majority and Senate Republicans who could save the commander in chief.

In the weeks ahead, the story of what went on in Trump's conversations with his Ukrainian counterpart and whether he broke the law and flouted the most basic constitutional principles will be distorted in a political maelstrom.

But after a week of leaks, standoffs between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, blockbuster revelations and gambles by key power brokers, the facts of the case are beginning to emerge.

Trump stands accused of illicitly using $400 million in military aid, to coerce vulnerable Ukraine, which is fighting for its life against Vladimir Putin's Russia, into investigating his potential 2020 foe Joe Biden.

The President seemed to think he could clear himself on Wednesday by releasing a rough transcript of a call with Zelensky. But his move made everything worse. Though Republicans insisted there was no quid pro quo, the document did show Trump leaning on Zelensky and asking for a ""favor.""

In 2016, Trump was accused of knowingly profiting from a Russian election meddling scheme. If the latest accusations are borne out, he took 2020 election interference into his own hands.

The case darkened considerably with Thursday's release of a whistleblower report that the White House had sought to suppress in order to contain the worst crisis of his presidency.

The still-unknown person who wrote the report accused the President of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.""

If such activity did take place, it would be about as close to a charge of presidential abuse of power -- a potentially impeachable offense -- as it is possible to get.

In another detail that will have far reaching implications, the whistleblower alleged that the White House tried to cover up the evidence of Trump's behavior.

The report said that officials were told to take the transcript of Trump's conversation with Zelensky from the computer system in which it was stored to another classified system used for the most sensitive national security information.

The move potentially corrupted a repository supposed to be used only for the nation's most sensitive secrets with material being protected for a purely political purpose.

""This is a coverup,"" said Pelosi, a California Democrat.

A road map

Democrats believe they now have a ""roadmap"" for the impeachment process announced by Pelosi on Wednesday after months of trying to hold back the liberal tide.

Her long-held reluctance to go this far may have strengthened the Democratic hand, since they can now argue that fresh evidence of lawlessness, not the disputed account of events provided by Mueller, forced their hands.

Pelosi on Thursday gave Schiff's Intelligence Committee the lead role in the impeachment inquiry.

Schiff's first move was to release the whistleblower complaint right before a hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who Democrats accused of holding back the complaint from Congress.

The whistleblower complaint, Schiff said, would provide a ""roadmap"" for the committee's push to interview witnesses and seek document requests over the matter.

During the hearing, Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander, said that both the whistleblower and the inspector general of the intelligence community who deemed the complaint ""urgent and credible"" had at all times followed the law.

The White House, initially stung by the sudden turn of events, is preparing a scorched earth defense.

""We see many Democrats who spent the last two and a half years on baseless accusations and they keep trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last presidential election,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday.

Later, it emerged that Trump directly targeted the whistleblower with a veiled hint of violence while addressing US diplomats at the United Nations.

""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy,"" Trump said, according to an audio recording released by the Los Angeles Times. ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.""

Biden weighs in

Biden responded to the President with his most combative comments of a saga that plays into his central campaign theme that Trump is unfit for office.

But Trump's claims that Biden and his son Hunter are guilty of corruption in Ukraine and China -- for which there is no evidence -- also threaten to emerge as a distraction for the former vice president.

At a fundraiser in California, Biden claimed Trump was trying to ""hijack an election.""

""He'd like to get foreign help to win elections,"" Biden said.

But Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway argued that the President was entirely within his rights to ask a foreign counterpart to investigate corruption -- borrowing the White House' s explanation for the call between Zelensky and the US leader.

""Having one President ask another President to help the enforcement of laws in alleged wrongdoing,"" Conaway said, ""is actually appropriate."""

The panel is in negotiations to interview the whistleblower who wrote in August an extraordinary complaint to intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson alleging that Trump asked Ukraine's President to initiate an investigation that could have benefited his reelection. Senior White House officials then endeavored to conceal records of the call including the official transcript, according to the complaint.

Schiff told CNN on Friday the committee expects a hearing as soon as next week, while the rest of Congress will be back in their districts for a two-week recess. The panel will hold another closed briefing with Atkinson on October 4, according to a source on the House Intelligence committee.

""We will move as expeditiously as possible,"" said Schiff. ""But we have to see what witnesses are going to make themselves available and what witnesses are going to require compulsion.""

If the White House stonewalls the investigation, he added, ""It'll just strengthen the case on obstruction,"" an impeachable offense. The panel and House Oversight consulted with the House Foreign Affairs committee to subpoena Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday over his failure to produce documents related to Ukraine.

Once it has exhausted its options — either by getting information or if the White House blocks its investigation — Democrats may move forward with articles of impeachment, potentially over obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.

It is unclear whether Schiff will invite other witnesses to come before his panel, but Democratic lawmakers on it would like to hear from people mentioned in the whistleblower's complaint, including Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and Attorney General Bill Barr.

""The discussions are underway between the relevant parties representing the whistleblower and others to see if that's an opportunity that can be afforded to us,"" Rep. Denny Heck, Democrat of Washington, told CNN. ""My view is the sooner the better. I would hope that that would happen within the next two weeks.""

""I would like next to talk to the whistleblower,"" he added.

House Democrats are hoping for a speedy process, aiming to potentially move forward with impeachment by Thanksgiving. While the Intelligence Committee continues its investigation over the October recess, the House Judiciary Committee is likely to begin sifting through existing evidence and considering a path forward for articles of impeachment, members say.

""I think members of the Judiciary Committee are going to be conferring with each other and thinking about some of the legal frameworks and some of the evidence that we've collected already, and what that supports in terms of articles of impeachment that we may or may not recommend to the full House,"" Rep. David Cicilline told CNN on Friday.

It remains a key unanswered question what articles of impeachment could look like — it depends on the Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation -- but Democrats are largely agreed on the focus for now. The Ukraine matter, Cicilline said, ""has to be the centerpiece of any impeachment proceedings.""

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, speaks at the Capitol in Washington earlier this week.

On a July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner was investigated by Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Shokin. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,"" said Trump on the call, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""

Trump also said he wanted his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Bill Barr to call Zelensky.

On August 12, a whistleblower expressed concerns to the intelligence community's inspector general Michael Atkinson about Trump's call with Zelensky. Atkinson deemed them credible and urgent and sent the complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The complaint was released ahead of Maguire's testimony Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

Reps. Eric Swalwell and Jackie Speier, California Democrats on the Intelligence committee, told CNN they have canceled events in their districts next week to prepare for potential action on the panel.

Speier told CNN she had a number of questions for the whistleblower, including whether he or she has additional information regarding other phone calls or circumstances ""in which there's been a quid pro quo kind of environment.""

""I want to know who else was privy to this information and didn't speak up,"" Speier said. ""We all take an oath of office when we become federal officials, and many of those people in the White House are federal officials.""

""There were gross violations of law and yet, he or she is the only person who came forward,"" she added.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said both Giuliani and Barr are ""obviously central figures"" in the complaint but that he would defer to Schiff on whether to invite them before the committee.

""I'm not too worried that, if we call Rudy Giuliani for a hearing that he wouldn't show up,"" added Krishnamoorthi.

(CNN) Here's a secret about authoritarian-minded leaders like President Donald Trump: They are their own best friends (they usually have few real friends), and they are their own worst enemies, especially when things are not going well for them.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat

This is Trump's current situation. Revelations that he tried to get Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden have led to the House Democratic leadership to announce the start of an impeachment inquiry. Trump has reacted predictably . ""Another Witch Hunt!"" reads one of a flood of Tweets on the subject.

Yet Trump has brought this situation on himself by demanding that Americans, including those who work in the White House and in the federal government, accept his autocratic personal style of governance, scorn for the rule of law and insatiable need for loyalty to him over duty to country. For at least some in the government — like the whistleblower and the intelligence community's inspector general — Trump's actions warranted sounding an alarm.

This is a predictable outcome for a leader who has been following the authoritarian playbook from the start. Authoritarians view public office in an entirely proprietary manner: It is their vehicle for power and enrichment for them and their family. National security, economic policy, and foreign relations must be subordinated to their personal agendas. In Trump's case, his agenda is a combination of making profits for the Trump Organization — for example by allegedly pressuring the US Air Force crews to stay at his Turnberry resort in Scotland during refueling stops (something Trump has said he knows nothing about) — and fending off anything and anyone that might threaten the consolidation of his power. This includes Biden, a man he evidently feels might take him out of office in 2020.

Leaders like Trump behave in predictable ways and follow foreseeable patterns as they use public office to further their private goals. First, they need co-conspirators: an inner sanctum of loyalists who will do their bidding and keep their secrets. This is why they often hire their own family members and why they fire so many other people — it can take a while to find the right individuals to infringe democratic norms for them. Trump now has the man he calls ""my attorney general,"" William Barr, who gave misleading information about the Mueller report to protect his boss and is cited repeatedly in the whistleblower's report as being involved (along with Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani) in the request for a favor from the Ukrainian leader, although the Justice Department released a statement denying that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians."

He continued, “Let’s look at what the whistleblower says. The whistleblower says it was a troubling call in which the president asked the Ukrainian president to investigate and to look at the allegation of this wrongdoing by Vice President Biden and by his son. We now have a rough transcript of that phone call and that’s exactly what happened.”

He added, “What is clear from reading the complaint that it is a serious allegation, that a lot of it has proven to be borne out already. The whistle-blower lays out a blueprint from talking to various officials in the White House, various officials in the State Department. And to dismiss this as a political hack seems to me to be an effort by the president defenders to try to make nothing out of something and there is something there.”

Adam Schiff (D-CA), speculated Fred Fleitz , president and CEO of the Center for Security Policy and a former member of the intelligence community.

Fleitz — who served as deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council — has previously held national-security jobs with the CIA, the DIA, the Department of State, and the House Intelligence Committee staff. He offered his analysis of the “whistleblower” complaint during a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Colin Madine.

Fleitz reflected on Thursday’s hearing before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Schiff, with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony. The hearing ostensibly sought to investigate a “whistleblower” complaint released to Congress and the public regarding President Donald Trump’s July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Let’s start with how strange this hearing was today,” began Fleitz. “We had the director of national intelligence before the committee. He couldn’t answer the questions because they were all about policy. You see, this is not an intelligence matter. The president is a part of the intelligence community, and intelligence officers can’t lodge complaints with their inspector general because they don’t agree with the president’s policies, but that’s what happened here.”

In a Thursday-published op-ed in the New York Post, Fleitz wrote, “It appears likely to me that this so-called whistleblower was pursuing a political agenda.”

LISTEN:

Fleitz continued, “Concerning the complaint, it looked like it was written by a team of attorneys. I was an intelligence analyst for 19 years. We don’t write that way. We see the very detailed legal footnotes to this. This, I think, was a setup job that included others, probably attorneys with the House Intelligence Committee.”

“Adam Schiff was talking and tweeting about the president meddling in Ukraine and leveraging aid to Ukraine to hurt the Bidens in August before this appeared, and lo and behold. this complaint happens to be filed so it will hit his committee,” added Fleitz. “I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”

Trump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent. It doesn’t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security. https://t.co/X4yhTS2q1Z — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) August 29, 2019

Mansour asked, “One of the accusations that they kept going after is that this conversation, this phone call, the transcript of it, was placed in some super secret special secure file database, and that shows that they were trying to keep this secret. What did you make of that?”

Fleitz replied, “As executive secretary of the NSC, I edited and processed transcripts of presidential phone calls with foreign leaders, and there’s a very secure area of the computer system where these are places. [The accusation], I think, is false, absolutely false, because I already know there’s a secure place to put this stuff. The allegation was, to protect this stuff, they were putting it into an intelligence computer system controlled by the CIA. That doesn’t make any sense. Why would the White House store something sensitive in a CIA computer system? It’s ridiculous. I just think the person who said this made it up.”

Fleitz explained protocol for documenting presidential phone calls with foreign leaders. “These phone calls are listened to and transcribed by intelligence officers in the White House Situation Room, and there may be an intelligence officer and a regional officer — like the Europe-Russia office that may also see it — and I would have seen it as the executive secretary. Anyone who works on these or has access has to control them very strictly and not tell anyone about them who’s not on the dissemination list.”

“If you read this complaint, it’s pretty clear,” Fleitz stated. “This person wasn’t on the dissemination list. People were talking to him about the complaint, even though he did not have the need to know or the right to know about this document. That said, people aren’t following the rules. … Extremely sensitive material is supposed to be kept confidential. They’re violating the president’s trust.”

Fleitz remarked, “There’s no question the president didn’t do anything illegal or anything required to be reported or anything that was impeachable. … If this whistleblower really thought that something had been done wrong by the president, he could have gone to the Foreign Affairs Committees, to the defense committees, the government oversight committees, but he can’t go to the intelligence committee because it’s not an intelligence matter, but it had been made one so Adam Schiff could handle it. Schiff was trying to argue any complaint submitted to the [intelligence community] inspector general has to be reported to Congress and is considered serious. What if the complaint doesn’t belong with the intelligence community inspector general, like this one? What I would’ve done if I was [inspector general], I’d say, ‘Well, you can’t bring this to us. You’re going to have to bring this to someone on the Hill, because this doesn’t involve an intelligence equity.’”

“If this is so serious, you should be prepared to stand behind it,” said Fleitz of the “whistleblower,” adding, “if you get fired for it, you’re standing on your honor. But we know very well that if this person was fired, he’ll be hired immediately by MSNBC. So this is not going to be a career-ending incident. This is political, 100 percent, and as I said, I think the House Intelligence Committee Democrat lawyers are deeply involved in it.”

“I think he’s a rogue intelligence officer,” said Fleitz of the bureaucrat who filed the aforementioned complaint, “and I’d say further, he is a rogue intelligence officer who is politicizing intelligence to destroy the president.”

Fleitz went on, “It just seems like the Democrats are going to stop at nothing to get this president out of office before the next election. The Russia collusion turned out to be a fraud, so they cooked this up. I heard Catherine Herridge say on Fox, ‘This seems to be a very well-written complaint,’ and I thought to myself, ‘Uh oh.’ Usually whistleblower complaints are not well-written. They’re written by people who are a little bit paranoid. They don’t want to consult with other people, but this was written by a team of people. I have no doubt of that, and I’m just thinking if this doesn’t work, they’re going to come up with something else.”

“There are many, many good guys [in the intelligence services],” estimated Fleitz. “The bad guys are a distinct minority. Some of them are in management. Even the vast majority of them [on the analytic side] are not political, they just want to do their jobs. I shared offices with people who were quite partisan Democrats who didn’t like President Reagan or really liked President Clinton, and they never let their politics get into their work, and that’s still the way it goes today.”

Fleitz determined, “It seems pretty clear to me that Adam Schiff and the Intelligence Committee Democrats knew about this. That makes me think that attorneys with that committee were working with this person or they directed him maybe to an outside attorney or to an outside expert who could help draft it, but I think the Schiff angle is very important, because things he said in August almost exactly match this whistleblowing complaint. That’s not a coincidence.”

“[Adam Schiff] sent out a tweet on the 28th of August which faulted President Trump for withholding military aid from Ukraine to harm Joe and Hunter Biden,” recalled Fleitz. “I mean, come on. This is two weeks before this whistleblowing complaint shows up making the same allegation, and it comes to his committee? Think about it. … Because it happened to be Adam Schiff, and this unusual request that shouldn’t have been in the intelligence sphere came into the intelligence sphere, forcing it into his committee, it’s just too many coincidences to be believed.”

.2/ Its pretty clear from the Washington Post story that someone knew the details of this complaint who is hostile to @realDonaldTrump and leaked it to the press. My guess is this leak came from House Democrats who have been heavily involved in orchestrating this complaint. — Fred Fleitz (@FredFleitz) September 26, 2019

“I think that by bringing this up, the Democrats are hurting Joe Biden, because a lot of Americans are wondering why was Hunter Biden getting $50,000 a month from the Ukrainians,” assessed Fleitz. “I told that to an Israeli official — I was at a reception with him, recently — he said to me, ‘Well, that sounds like a bribe.’ I said, ‘No, they’re buying influence.’ He said, ‘No, in Israel, that’s a bribe.’”

Fleitz concluded, “I think this is going to backfire [on Democrats].”

Now here's the thing that's truly mind-boggling. This week, that brief, damning summary describes the political reality of two of the world's leading nations, both the United Kingdom and the United States. As an American born and raised in Washington DC and a historian of modern Britain now rearing a blended US-UK family in both countries, I can only marvel and strive to make sense of what's happening as both countries seem to sink ever deeper into a political abyss of their own making.

The conclusions are hardly encouraging. While both prime minister Boris Johnson and President Donald Trump were elected under the banner of one of their country's major political parties, both stake their claim to legitimacy not on their having won out in the traditional game of party politics, but on their ability to cut through ""politics as usual"" and act on behalf of the popular will.

In the US, this populism manifests itself most clearly in Trump's promise to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, or side-step the party hacks, including those members of his own party, who see their only job as maintaining the status quo.

To review: In Britain, the high court declared on Wednesday that Johnson's actions advising the queen to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament for five weeks in the run up to the October 31 Brexit deadline was unlawful, as there appeared to be no justification for the suspension. Their ruling compelled Johnson to leave the UN climate change summit in New York and fly back to London where he met MPs with defiance, declaring the court's decision wrong and reiterating his determination to ""get Brexit done.""

The reason they made their announcement and explained their reasoning as a group, in an op-ed in The Washington Post , is because they had already formed a bond over their national security background -- especially the five women: Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, both ex-CIA officers; Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania who was in the Air Force; Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia were Naval officers.

They met on the 2018 campaign trail as first time candidates who kept bumping into each other at events with mutual donors and supporters.

When they got to talking, these five would-be congresswomen realized that they had a lot in common, despite being from different parts of the country: they all had careers in national security they were trying to parlay into elected office.

They became fast friends, and called themselves the ""badasses.""

""I think badasses kind of came organically from the group since we all had either served in the military or in the CIA,"" Houlahan said.

They are now a band of sisters who bonded while storming the unfamiliar terrain of politics.

""Being able to text folks and say, 'you know, I'm really getting hit up on this issue, how have you been handling it?' 'I'm not sure how to translate my service into something that's relatable. How do you guys do that?'"" Slotkin said she frequently asked the others.

""We have a lot in common,"" said Spanberger. ""We all were working to flip seats to be elected in places where voters may not typically vote for people like us or with our backgrounds.""

Making their mark in an unlikely way: impeachment

When we first talked in mid-September, none of the five congresswomen women supported an impeachment inquiry. Then, after hearing Trump admit that he spoke to Ukraine's leader about Joe Biden , a potential 2020 political rival, they changed their minds. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Trump himself has denied any wrongdoing.

""Having the sitting President of the United States, use leverage over a foreign leader to get dirt on an opponent,"" Slotkin said. ""That very basic idea, I think cut for us, as national security people, just close to the bone.""

The op-ed the women penned, along with Gil Cisneros and Jason Crow, two freshmen male veterans, opened the floodgates for others who had been resistant, and gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi critical political cover as she announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.

They say it was all for one, and one for all.

""A great example of the power of teamwork,"" Houlahan said.

""I think we all sort of came to that conclusion together,"" Sherrill said. ""We text each other as you know, and I think we were all going, okay, I think this has all changed. This is a bright line.""

Still, it was a big leap for people still trying to find their sea legs in politics.

""I'm supervising the operation nuclear reactor,"" Luria recalls of her time before being in office. ""I never turned the reactor operator and said, are you a Democrat or Republican?""

""It was new to jump into such a partisan environment,"" she added.

From left to right, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, Rep. Mikie Sherill of New Jersey, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Top GOP targets

Backing an impeachment inquiry is risky political business for these congresswomen -- some of the biggest political targets in the House. They are Democrats who won mostly in Trump territory by campaigning on kitchen table issues like health care and affordable prescription drugs.

Their GOP opponents are already attacking them hard for backing an impeachment inquiry of a president who won in 2016 with considerable support in most of their districts.

""I believe that if I am out there explaining what these allegations are to the people of my district and to the people of other districts, and why they are so deeply concerned that the people will understand why we had to take a stand,"" said Spanberger, the first Democrat to represent her Virginia district since in almost 50 years, and where President Trump won by 7 percentage points.

They are under no illusion that this is going to be politically easy for them.

""All of us in our prior lives all the time had to make hard calls for the reasons we thought were right when we knew that not everyone would understand or even know,"" declared Slotkin, who also represents a district where Trump won by 7 percentage points. "" And that to me is something I feel comfortable doing because I've always had to do it.""

CNN sat down with these self-described ""badasses"" in the House Armed Services Committee room on Capitol Hill, surrounded by portraits of all the men -- only men -- who have chaired the committee on which four of them now sit.

Houlahan noted that many of them, as well as rank-and-file members of this committee, historically did not always have previous military service on their resumes.

Luria and Sherrill -- both Navy veterans -- quickly agreed.

""You were on ships,"" said Houlahan, pointing to Luria. ""I was an engineer.""

""We were all, you know, kind of experiencing our service in different ways,"" Houlahan said. ""And I think we're able to fold that in together on legislative ideas and our agendas.""

""I did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military"" added Slotkin a former CIA officer, ""carrying a weapon and wearing my body armor. And I think there's something about having done prior service that connects you to the consequences of the decisions that are being made here and at the White House.""

Not 'the squad'

Until now, the House freshmen group that got the most headlines is the so-called ""squad,"" who come from reliably Democratic areas far different from the swing districts these ""Badasses"" represent.

They have different political realities, and very different styles.

""None of us is ever going to get in a Twitter war with anyone else,"" Slotkin said flatly. ""If we have a concern with someone, we're going to go right up and talk to them about it and we're not going to add unhelpful rhetoric to an already bad tone coming out of Washington.""

Have they been frustrated that ""the squad"" and Twitter wars they're involved in get attention?

""I don't care who has the headlines,"" Spanberger responded. ""I care about the legislation that we prioritize and I don't think any of us want to be the loudest voice in the room. I just want to be one of the most effective.""

They also realize that despite needing GOP votes to win these moderate districts, they also need to keep their left flank happy, and excited.

""What I tell people in my district, the left wing of our party has created such momentum behind things like moving forward on our environment,"" Sherrill said.

From left to right, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Rep. Mikie Sherill of New Jersey, Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Bonding over job as well as family

They picked offices near one another, which they say makes it easier to work together -- in rarer moments than they anticipated -- decompress with a glass of wine of a bottle of beer.

They bond not just over their jobs, but their families. They all have children -- some, very young.

Spanberger has three daughters ages five, eight and eleven, and says her middle daughter wants to be Houlahan for Halloween.

""It's gonna be hard to pull off,"" Houlahan said, laughing.

Sherrill is a mother of four young children.

""Somebody said to me the other day, they said, 'well, you're just real down to earth. You're not, you know, you're pretty humble.' And I said, yeah, I have a 14-year-old daughter, It's really hard not to be humble,"" joked Sherrill.

Slotkin said that when she started running for Congress she was struck by how unusual it seemed for people that her husband was by her side as an active participant in her campaign.

""A lot of people would say, you guys are so modern ... I said, what? What does that mean?"" she recalled.

""I realized after a few people said it, that they were used to either a man running for office and the wife is way in the background, you know, quiet, not a part of the campaign,"" Slotkin said. ""Or there is a strong woman who's running, we've had strong women who have run and won, but their husband is nowhere to be seen. So when they saw a strong woman and a strong man together, that was new for them.""

Breaking the chain of command

The ""badasses"" say that several more senior women in Congress have told them how much they marveled at how fearless they are in meetings and in hearings, considering how new they are to politics, never mind Congress.

""There's not a vertical chain of command structure,"" said Luria, noting the difference between Congress and the Navy where she served for 20 years.

When reminded that it may be less formal in Congress, but there historically is a wait-your-turn and know-your-place Capitol Hill dynamic, they collectively shrugged that off.

""None of us, none of us came to Congress from a district that wants us to just sit here and be quiet and learn the ropes and figure it out,"" Sherrill said. ""They want us to engage and they want change and they want it now.""

They are certainly getting it."

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) is hawking “Impeach the MF” t-shirts following the House Democrats’ launch of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump for a telephone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky over the summer.

On sale for $29 apiece, the shirts come in six different designs and feature Tlaib’s infamous 2017 call to “impeach the mother fucker!” — an expletive reference to the president.

“You’ve asked for ‘em. And now we’ve got ‘em,” Tlaib’s campaign wrote of the shirts in an email to supporters.

The Michigan Democrat took to Twitter to promote the shirts herself, writing: “Lean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable. Together, we will fight back and protect our democracy. Our country depends on it!”

The t-shirts are a play on a pledge in which Tlaib, fresh off her swearing-in to Congress, recounted a story about how she told her son that she would ensure the impeachment of President Trump.

“‘Look, Mama, you won. Bullies don’t win.’ And I said, ‘Baby, they don’t because we’re going to go in there and we’re going to impeach the mother fucker,” she told attendees of a MoveOn.org event, prompting cheers.

The freshman congresswoman’s crude comments drew awe from lawmakers and even the scorn of President Trump, who called them “disgraceful”

“This is a person I don’t know, I assume she’s new,” the president said. “I think she dishonored herself and dishonored her family using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Tlaib, one of the congressional Democrats’ most ardent supporters of impeachment, introduced a resolution to oust the president in March. In light of the Trump-Zelensky call, Tlaib accused the president of putting “the lives of Americans in jeopardy by putting his personal interests before our country that he took an oath to defend.”

“Impeachment is our only option,” she added.

And it appears that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) likely agrees. The California Democrat launched a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, citing a so-called “whistleblower’s” complaint alleging President Trump pressed Ukraine’s president to investigate Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the eastern European country.

On Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the call, in which the president mentioned possible wrongdoing by the Biden family, thoug, as Zelenksy stated later in the day, he felt no pressure whatsoever by the president to probe into the matter.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky told reporters at the United Nations in New York City.

According to the New York Times, the partisan federal employee who issued the complaint is a male CIA officer who was previously “detailed to work at the White House.”

The officer, who has since returned to work at the CIA, is believed to be an “analyst by training” and “steeped in details” of U.S. foreign policy toward Europe and to possess a “sophisticated understanding” of Ukrainian politics.

The Department of Justice on Wednesday confirmed the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found that the so-called “whistleblower” not only had second-hand information regarding the call, but also possessed a “political bias” in favor of a “political rival” of President Trump. It’s been widely reported that the officer did not hear the Trump-Zelensky call directly and relied on second-hand information to formulate his complaint."

Then one day, a punch from an unexpected character draws blood. The bully's vulnerability becomes apparent and suddenly all those who trembled join to fight their former tormentor. Feared but not loved, the bully is vanquished.

Michael D'Antonio

In politics, as in Hollywood, those who'd rather pick a fight than compromise -- or, in Donald Trump's case, act with basic decency -- create the conditions for their own downfall. After Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry, there were early signs of the President's weakness. While the knockout punch has not been delivered, Republicans who were previously staunch allies began to waver.

On Friday, former Sen. Jeff Flake told NPR that at least 35 GOP Senators would support impeaching Trump if they were allowed to vote in secret. ""Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons realizes that there's not a lot of love for the President. There's a lot of fear of what it means to go against the President, but most Republican senators would not like to be dealing with this for another year or another five years,"" he said. Added to Democratic votes, Flake's estimate of 35 Republicans would make for the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office.

As Flake suggests, Republican officials may fear Trump but they do not like him. Consider the President's penchant for insults and demeaning nicknames and it's easy to agree with Flake's logic. Remember that then-candidate Trump mocked and disparaged Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz as ""Little Marco"" and ""Lyin' Ted"" and you'll understand why they might have little sympathy for him now.

Trump's vulnerability was in clear view when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell allowed the upper chamber to vote on a resolution urging the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress. The resolution passed unanimously in the GOP-controlled Senate."

Earlier this year, the former vice president was accused of inappropriate touching by Lucy Flores, the Democrat’s unsuccessful 2014 nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada. In a widely circulated op-ed, Flores alleged Biden inappropriately touched and kissed her during a campaign event. Following the revelations, several more women came forward to accuse Biden of unwanted touching.

610,Kristina Wong,"The Hill‘s John Solomon is reporting that the documents — many from the American legal team that helped the company, Burisma Holdings, try to stave off its legal troubles — raise the “troubling prospect” that U.S. officials  may have “painted a false picture … [+10612 chars]",Hundreds of pages of documents conflict with a story that Biden has been telling about him pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor.,2019-09-27,Breitbart News,Report: Hundreds of Documents Conflict with Joe Biden’s Account of Why Ukrainian Prosecutor Was Fired,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/09/26/report-hundreds-of-documents-conflict-with-joe-bidens-account-of-why-ukrainian-prosecutor-was-fired/,"Hundreds of pages of never-released memos and documents conflict with a story that former Vice President Joe Biden has been telling about him pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor because he was corrupt, and not because the prosecutor was investigating a company that hired his son, according to a report.

The Hill‘s John Solomon is reporting that the documents — many from the American legal team that helped the company, Burisma Holdings, try to stave off its legal troubles — raise the “troubling prospect” that U.S. officials may have “painted a false picture in Ukraine that helped “ease Burisma’s legal troubles and stop prosecutors’ plans to interview” Biden’s son Hunter during the 2016 presidential elections.

Solomon reported that, for instance, an official Ukrainian government memo shows that Burisma’s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after Biden forced the firing of the chief prosecutor and offered “an apology for dissemination of false information by U.S. representatives and public figures” about Ukrainian prosecutors.

In other words — the company that employed Biden’s son apologized to the Ukrainian government after the firing of the chief prosecutor for the “U.S. representatives and public figures” actions or remarks.

Solomon also reported that Burisma’s American team offered to introduce Ukrainian prosecutors to Obama administration officials to make amends, according to the Ukrainian government memo and Burisma’s American legal team’s internal memos.

According to Solomon, the memos raise the following “troubling questions”:

1) If the Ukraine prosecutor’s firing involved only his alleged corruption and ineptitude, why did Burisma’s American legal team refer to those allegations as “false information?” 2) If the firing had nothing to do with the Burisma case, as Biden has adamantly claimed, why would Burisma’s American lawyers contact the replacement prosecutor within hours of the termination and urgently seek a meeting in Ukraine to discuss the case?

Solomon reported that in a “newly sworn affidavit prepared for a European court,” Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin testified that when he was fired in March 2016, he was told the reason was that Biden was unhappy about the Burisma investigation.

“The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors,” Shokin testified, according to Solomon.

“On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company but I refused to close this investigation,” Shokin reportedly said.

Solomon said other documents show that as Biden’s efforts to fire Shokin picked up steam, Burisma’s American legal team “appeared to be moving into Ukraine with intensity.”

Burisma’s accounting records “show that it paid tens of thousands of dollars while Hunter Biden served on the board of an American lobbying and public relations firm, Blue Star Strategies, run by Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano, who both served in President Bill Clinton’s administration.”

According to Solomon, just days before Shokin’s firing, Painter met with the second highest official at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington and asked to meet officials in Kiev around the same time that Joe Biden visited there.

Ukrainian embassy employee Oksana Shulyar reportedly emailed Painter afterward: “With regards to the meetings in Kiev, I suggest that you wait until the next week when there is an expected vote of the government’s reshuffle.”

Ukraine’s Washington embassy confirmed the conversations between Shulyar and Painter but said the reference to a shakeup in Ukrainian government was not specifically referring to Shokin’s firing or anything to do with Burisma, according to Solomon.

Painter reportedly asked one of the Ukraine embassy’s workers to “open the door for meetings with Ukraine’s prosecutors about the Burisma investigation.” Blue Star would eventually pay that Ukrainian official money for his help with the prosecutor’s office, according to Solomon.

At the same time, Blue Star worked in concert with an American criminal defense lawyer, John Buretta, who was hired by Burisma to help address the case in Ukraine, according to Solomon. That case was settled in January 2017 for a few million dollars in fines for alleged tax issues, he reported.

Solomon reported that Buretta, Painter, Tramontano, Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden’s campaign have not responded to “numerous calls and emails seeking comment.”

On March 29, 2016, the day Shokin’s firing was announced, Buretta reportedly asked to speak with Yuriy Sevruk, the prosecutor named to temporarily replace Shokin, but was turned down.

However, Blue Star, using the Ukrainian embassy worker it had hired, eventually scored a meeting with Sevruk on April 6, 2016, a week after Shokin’s firing. Buretta, Tramontano, and Painter attended that meeting in Kiev, according to Blue Star’s memos, Solomon reported.

Sevruk memorialized the meeting in a government memo that the general prosecutor’s office provided to Solomon, stating that the three Americans offered an apology for the “false” narrative that had been provided by U.S. officials about Shokin being corrupt and inept.

“They realized that the information disseminated in the U.S. was incorrect and that they would facilitate my visit to the U.S. for the purpose of delivering the true information to the State Department management,” the memo reportedly stated.

The memo also reportedly quoted the Americans as saying they knew Shokin pursued an aggressive corruption investigation against Burisma’s owner, only to be thwarted by British allies:

These individuals noted that they had been aware that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine had implemented all required steps for prosecution … and that he was released by the British court due to the underperformance of the British law enforcement agencies.

This memo provides a “vastly different portrayal” of Shokin than Biden’s account, Solomon reported.

Solomon said the contents of the memo are partially backed by subsequent emails from Blue Star and Buretta that confirm the offer to bring Ukrainian authorities to meet the Obama administration in Washington:

For instance, Tramontano wrote the Ukrainian prosecution team on April 16, 2016, saying U.S. Justice Department officials, including top international prosecutor Bruce Swartz, might be willing to meet. ‘The reforms are not known to the US Justice Department and it would be useful for the Prosecutor General to meet officials in the US and share this information directly,’ she wrote. Buretta sent a similar email to the Ukrainians, writing that ‘I think you would find it productive to meet with DOJ officials in Washington’ and providing contact information for Swartz. ‘I would be happy to help,’ added Buretta, a former senior DOJ official. Burisma, Buretta and Blue Star continued throughout 2016 to try to resolve the open issues in Ukraine, and memos recount various contacts with the State Department and the U.S. embassy in Kiev seeking help in getting the Burisma case resolved. Just days before Trump took office, Burisma announced it had resolved all of its legal issues. And Buretta gave an interview in Ukraine about how he helped navigate the issues.

Solomon reported that Ukrainian prosecutors say they have tried to get this information to the Justice Department since the summer of 2018, fearing it is evidence of possible violations of U.S. ethics laws, and they hired a former federal prosecutor to bring the information to the U.S. Attorney in New York, who reportedly “showed no interest.” The Ukrainians then reached out to Tump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

As Solomon noted, the New York Times first published a story in December 2015 about Burisma hiring Hunter Biden just weeks after the vice president was asked by President Obama to oversee U.S.-Ukraine relations. That story also alerted Biden’s office that Shokin had an active investigation of Burisma and its founder, he noted.

Solomon detailed his previous reporting on “an effort to change the narrative” after the Times story about Hunter Biden ran, “with the help of the Obama State Department”:

Hunter Biden’s American business partner in Burisma, Devon Archer, texted a colleague two days after the Times story about a strategy to counter the ‘new wave of scrutiny’ and stated that he and Hunter Biden had just met at the State Department. The text suggested there was about to be a new “USAID project the embassy is announcing with us” and that it was “perfect for us to move forward now with momentum.” I have sued the State Department for any records related to that meeting. The reason is simple: There is both a public interest and an ethics question to knowing if Hunter Biden and his team sought State’s assistance while his father was vice president. The controversy ignited anew earlier this year when I disclosed that Joe Biden admitted during a 2018 videotaped speech that, as vice president in March 2016, he threatened to cancel $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, to pressure Ukraine’s then-President Petro Poroshenko to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin’s office was investigating Burisma. Shokin told me he was making plans to question Hunter Biden about $3 million in fees that Biden and his partner, Archer, collected from Burisma through their American firm. Documents seized by the FBI in an unrelated case confirm the payments, which in many months totaled more than $166,000. Some media outlets have reported that, at the time Joe Biden forced the firing in March 2016, there were no open investigations. Those reports are wrong. A British-based investigation of Burisma’s owner was closed down in early 2015 on a technicality when a deadline for documents was not met. But the Ukraine Prosecutor General’s office still had two open inquiries in March 2016, according to the official case file provided me. One of those cases involved taxes; the other, allegations of corruption. Burisma announced the cases against it were not closed and settled until January 2017. After I first reported it in a column, the New York Times and ABC News published similar stories confirming my reporting. Joe Biden has since responded that he forced Shokin’s firing over concerns about corruption and ineptitude, which he claims were widely shared by Western allies, and that it had nothing to do with the Burisma investigation.

Solomon wrote, “Today, two questions remain:”

One is whether it was ethically improper or even illegal for Biden to intervene to fire the prosecutor handling Burisma’s case, given his son’s interests. That is one that requires more investigation and the expertise of lawyers.

“The second is whether Biden has given the American people an honest accounting of what happened. The new documents I obtained raise serious doubts about his story’s credibility. And that’s an issue that needs to be resolved by voter,” Solomon wrote."

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is reportedly considering an investigation into the former Vice President, according to sources that spoke to the Washington Post. The senator, himself, appeared to confirm an investigation was likely when speaking to reporters about the topic on Wednesday.

“We have and will continue to gather information and conduct oversight on alleged misconduct within government agencies,” Johnson said.

The move comes after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government investigate Hunter Biden’s tenure on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the company in 2014, purportedly making as much as $83,000 per month, to consult on legal services. The appointment immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about the true nature of his role, since he possessed no background in either the energy industry or Ukraine.

Around the same tim Hunter Biden joined Burisma, his father was appointed as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine. Even more troubling is that at the time of the appointment, Burisma was attempting to sway western leaders after its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, was accused of money laundering and had his assets seized in Great Britain. Zlochevsky is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s leading oligarchs and has strong political ties to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Even more troubling is the fact that in 2016, Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Victor Shokin, who was known to be investigating Zlochevsky and Burisma. Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid if Shokin was not removed came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor’s abilities to root out corruption.

The explanation, however, was only muddied when Shokin’s successor, who had previously served a prison sentence for public corruption, closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky.

The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son’s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Joe Biden angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump’s alleged misuse of power.

The former vice president’s claim, though, directly contradicts his son’s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a New Yorker profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do,’” Hunter Biden told the magazine.

If Johnson were to open a probe into the former vice president, it would likely overlap with an existing probe by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) into Hunter Biden’s business ties to China. In August, Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, began investigating the Obama-Biden administration’s decision to approve the sale of a U.S. company with insight into “military applications” to the Chinese government and an investment firm run by Hunter Biden.

In particular, Grassley has questioned if the decision to approve the sale violated the White House’s ethical guidelines governing conflicts of interest."

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

Sekulow called the probe into alleged Trump wrongdoing a “faux investigation” over something that would not be admitted in court, hinting at a conspiracy because the complaint appears to have been “written by a law firm.”

“When you start with a witness saying, Steve and Brian, ‘I have no knowledge of the events I’m depicting here, and I’m basing this on conversations I had with colleagues of mine, and I think they’re trustworthy,’ well, do you know if they heard it correctly? I don’t know because I don’t have firsthand knowledge. And do you think the whistleblower drafted that complaint? I mean, realistically?” Sekulow posited.

“You think they had help?” co-host Brian Kilmeade asked. “Did they have help?”

“Look at the phraseology, the endnotes, and the footnotes,” Sekulow replied. “This wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm. And you know what? The American people see it for what it is. Nobody has the appetite for this anymore. They want to keep doing it — call for a vote. … Tell Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff. Call for a vote. Just go ahead and do it. See what happens.”

Maher began by saying, “I don’t think he was doing something terrible in Ukraine, but it’s just so — why can’t politicians tell their f*cking kids get a job? Get a goddamn job. I mean, this kid was paid $600,000 because his name is Biden, by a gas company in Ukraine, this super corrupt country that just had a revolution to get rid of corruption. It just looks bad.

Asked about how the impeachment inquiry is received by “people on the ground,” the voter noted that the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden, received little attention until President Trump highlighted the Biden family’s possible wrongdoings.

“Biden got a nice little deal for his boy and got a whole bunch of money for him and his firm and nobody said nothing about it,” the voter told correspondent Ali Vitali. “All of a sudden, Trump opens his mouth and says something and it’s ‘Oh my god, impeach him!'”

Schweizer, the president of the Government Accountability Institute and a senior Breitbart contributor, published Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends in 2018 — exposing several questionable deals in close proximity to Biden’s foreign policy activities as Vice President. Now, it appears that this debate over Trump, Ukraine, and Biden has made Secret Empires‘ revelations a topic penetrating everyday discussions across America.

This week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry over a partisan CIA officer’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint alleging President Trump pressured Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Hunter Biden. On Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, which shows no pressure was applied, and Zelensky himself has vehemently denied any push from the president to probe Biden. Notably, the complaint, which was released on Thursday, is based on second-hand accounts and possesses several inaccuracies.

“I think some of these people in the Congress should get back to doing their job instead of what they’ve been trying to do for two years,” the Granite State voter told MSNBC. “We have people that are living in this country that are depending on them doing stuff for us and they aren’t doing anything for us.”

When asked for his thoughts on House Democrats moving forward with their impeachment inquiry, the voter exclaimed. “They’re crazy.”

The voter’s sheer lack of interest in the issue of impeachment was echoed by former Ohio governor John Kasich (R), who said Friday that Ohioans aren’t talking about the inquiry or the call that prompted it.

“I’m out here in Ohio, I’m finally back in the heartland. There’s nobody talking about this. There’s nobody coming up to me and saying “Oh my goodness!” So, it takes time and it’s got to be made clear to the public what this is all about. Therefore, I think this investigation has to continue,” he told CNN’s New Day.

During his remarks, Trump took aim at the media, former Vice President Joe Biden, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and the so-called “whistleblower” who set the stage for impeachment proceedings led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“We’re at war,” he said. “These people are sick, they’re sick and nobody’s called it out like I do, I don’t understand, people are afraid to call it out, they are afraid to say that the press is crooked, we have a crooked press, we have a dishonest media.”

When Trump mentioned “Liddle” Adam Schiff, a person in the audience shouted “pencil neck” prompting Trump to repeat the nickname that he coined on Twitter.

“That name stuck,” Trump grinned. “He’s got a neck, it’s about this big. He’s got shirts that are too big because you can’t buy shirts that are that small.”

Video of Trump’s fundraiser remarks was leaked to Bloomberg News and audio of the conversation was leaked to the New York Times.

He also mocked Biden, a potential 2020 rival for president.

“And then you have sleepy Joe Biden who is dumb as a rock, this guy was dumb on his best day, and he’s not having his best day right now,” Trump continued.

He appeared incredulous that Biden’s son Hunter Biden earned millions of dollars from Ukraine and China after getting discharged from the Navy for cocaine use.

He said:

His kid, who’s got a lot of problems, he got thrown out of the Navy. I mean look I’m not going to — it’s a problem, that’s a problem, so we won’t get into why and all that. But he got thrown out of the Navy, and now this kid goes into Ukraine, walks away with millions of dollars, and he becomes a consultant for $50,000 a month. And he doesn’t know anything compared to anybody in this room. He’s a stiff, he knows nothing.

Trump also pointed to Hunter Biden’s work in China, getting $1.5 billion in an investment fund after flying with his father to visit the country on Air Force Two.

“That’s probably not all they gave him, they gave him plenty more I’m sure,” he said. “We might never find out.”

He suggested that Hunter Biden’s activities overseas paled in comparison to his actions.

“And then they talk about me, and I didn’t do anything,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m the most innocent person in the world.”

Trump described the whistleblower as “fake,” and “highly partisan,” suggesting that he was a “spy.”

He said:

[B]asically that person never saw the report, never saw the call. Never saw the call. Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is — sort of like almost a spy. I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistle-blower the information because that’s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.

Trump said his conversation with Urkaine President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect.”

He described Zelensky as a “really nice gentleman” during his meeting with him on Wednesday, noting he told the press he never felt pressured by Trump to investigate Biden.

“These animals in the press, they’re animals… they’re some of the worst people you will ever meet,” Trump said. “They’re scum, many of them are scum, and you have some good reporters but not many of them, but that’s one of the things that we battle.”

Trump highlighted Democrat senators that “strong-armed” Ukraine to participate in the Russia investigation, describing them as hypocrites.

Trump said that his chances for reelection were “looking good” and referred to a clip from HBO’s Bill Maher for telling a guest that Trump would win and “never leave” the presidency.

“I thought he was kidding, he was being serious,” Trump marveled.

He also cited a TIME magazine video featuring Trump 2020, Trump 2024, and Trump 2028 campaign signs that he repeatedly shared on Twitter.

“We do that to drive them fricken crazy,” he said."

Rudy Giuliani really ought to stop talking and get a lawyer…I’m calling for the IG to investigate if any State officials worked with Giuliani to help him with his personal quest, but I am also saying…the state bar of New York needs to investigate Rudy Giuliani.

Harris’s statements come on the heels of Thursday’s controversial “whistleblower” release, which included a claim that State Department officials spoke to Giuliani “in an attempt to ‘contain the damage’ to U.S. national security” over his communications with Ukraine. Giuliani bluntly told CNN that he had “no knowledge of any of that crap.”

“At no time did either one of them say they wanted to contain damage,” Giuliani said. “At no time did the State Department in communication with me ever relay any of that information you’re talking about.”

President Trump continues to fight allegations of inappropriate interaction with Ukraine. In response, he personally authorized the release of the now-infamous call’s full transcript. Democrats — including the historically resistant Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — claim that the call forms a legitimate basis for an impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, despite his lamentation that Trump’s conduct is a “tragedy for this country,” former Vice President Joe Biden is facing some tough questions of his own. His son, Hunter Biden, was given a position on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas company, despite having no related experience.

This was during his father’s tenure as the Obama administration’s Ukraine “point man.” And while Biden claims never to have spoken with his son about the dealings, Hunter’s own account is directly contradictory."

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R), a staunch Trump critic, was first to back the impeachment probe, saying in a statement Wednesday the move is “appropriate,” but lawmakers on Capitol Hill must further investigate the matter before reaching a conclusion whether to remove the president.

House Democrats are moving expeditiously with an impeachment probe in light of a partisan CIA officer’s so-called “whistleblower” complaint alleging President Trump pressured Zelensky during a July 25th call to probe the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.)

Though Democrats claim the contents of the call — a transcript of which was released by the White House this week — show a clear attempt by President Trump to invite Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election, Zelensky himself has passionately denied the allegation, saying he felt no pressure whatsoever from the president to probe the Biden family.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky, flanked by the president, told reporters at the United Nations in New York City.

On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee released the complaint ahead of acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire testify before the panel to discuss the handling of the complaint. During the hearing, Maguire was goaded several times to comment on the complaint’s credibility — something he maintained was for the intelligence community inspector general to discern.

Though, what federal authorities have confirmed is complaint’s author did not listen to the Trump-Zelensky call and only possessed second-hand information, which as Sen. Michael Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News Thursday, amounts to “hearsay.” Further, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel’s (OLC) affirmed the Deep Stater harbors a bias for a political rival of President Trump."

As he signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Ben Franklin famously said, “If we don’t all hang together, we will all hang separately.” That is, if we patriots don’t stay close and stay strong, the British will divide us, conquer us—and hang each one of us.

In military terms, this is a core concept: Wise generals know to keep their force united, lest individual elements be attacked separately and defeated in detail.

We can add that the same point about the value of unity also applies to smaller battle situations, in which group psychology plays an important role. The anthropological term for the power of togetherness is synchrony; it explains why soldiers enjoy higher morale when they march in formation and why they fight better when they stay in a group.

This principle of unity applies, as well, to political combat—the more concentrated the mass, the better. And it applies particularly to Washington’s periodic media feeding-frenzies, such as the one we’re seeing today over the White House “whistleblower.”

So we come to a key takeaway involving, yes, the importance of political solidarity. It’s true that sometimes in difficult political situations it might seem that the safest course of action is “every man for himself,” and yet, far more often there’s more safety, as well as strength, to be found in unity—including the unity of staying on message.

1974 and 1998

We can look back to history to see how this dynamic—solidarity, or not—has played out:

During the Watergate investigation, 1972-74, many congressional Republicans split away from their fellow Republican, President Richard Nixon. In the course of that two-year ordeal, Washington was a feeding frenzy of leaky independent counsels, impeachment-bent Democrats, and thirsting-for-blood reporters; in the middle of this mess, many Republicans figured that they could save themselves by abandoning Nixon.

At the same time, many other Republicans chose to stick with Nixon. Why? Some GOPers simply believed that the 37th president hadn’t done anything wrong, although probably more thought that whatever he might have done, it was no worse than what was done by his predecessors in the White House; Victor Lasky chronicled prior presidential skullduggery in an underground classic from that era, It Didn’t Start With Watergate.

Yet Republican stalwarts were undercut and isolated when other Republicans broke ranks. Most famously, there was Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee, who always asked, in his TV-soundbite twang, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” Baker’s question could be construed as neutral, and yet there was always another layer of meaning in his voice; the subtext was, What did the president know—and when will we find out?

Meanwhile, other Republicans, such as Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, were openly hostile to Nixon and happy to help force him out of office.

So we can see: During Watergate, Republicans did not put up a united front; they broke ranks and scattered every which way. As a result, facing the inevitability of bipartisan impeachment and conviction, in August 1974, Nixon resigned. In a televised speech announcing his resignation, he put the end of his presidency in starkly political terms: “I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort”—that effort, of course, being the fight against impeachment and conviction.

Yet even though Republicans had scattered during Watergate, three months later, in November 1974, the GOP was clobbered in the midterm elections; the party lost four seats in the Senate and 49 seats in the House. Indeed, plenty of Republicans who had supported impeachment were defeated, including Rep. Larry Hogan of Maryland—the father of the current governor. (We can also add that both Baker and Weicker later ran for president; neither got very far, as Republican activists had not forgotten their anti-Nixon positioning; the next GOP presidential nominations went to Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bob Dole—all Nixon loyalists.)

Okay, so now we can skip ahead a quarter-century, to see what happens when a party sticks with its president. Short version: Unity works better.

During the 1998-99 investigation and impeachment of Bill Clinton—Monica Lewinsky, the blue dress, perjury, and all that—congressional Democrats rallied to defend the embattled 42nd president, as well as their individual seats.

In fact, during the investigation, Democrats didn’t just play defense; they actively went on offense. Democrat and allied media-diggers uncovered extramarital affairs in the private lives of top Republicans, including Reps. Bob Livingston and Henry Hyde. And those Republicans who couldn’t be painted as sexual hypocrites were trashed as censorious religious-right zealots. (Poor Monica Lewinsky: She was victimized too soon; it would be another two decades before the Harvey Weinstein case got liberals interested in defending victimized women.)

For the Democrats, the kitchen-sink strategy worked: In the 1998 midterm elections—which historical cycles said should have gone against them—they broke even in the Senate (one of those senatorial gainers was New York’s Chuck Schumer), and gained five seats in the House. It was a stupendous political upset, breaking any chance that Congress would actually remove Clinton from office.

So if we compare the results of 1974 to those of 1998, it’s obvious: It’s best to stay together and not lose cohesion. And oh yes, there’s a further point: The best defense is a good offense.

Did the Democrats Walk into a Trap of Their Own Making?

Okay, so now let’s move from Watergate and Monicagate to the new Beltway uproar: Russiagate—oops, that’s old news; maybe the Democrats will soon be calling it Ukrainegate, or Whistleblowergate. Or perhaps they’ll simply call it, Destroy Trump.

Interestingly, some Democrats have concerns about this new course; they are reminding themselves that the 2020 election is barely more than a year away—so why winch up the whole impeachment effort now? Why shift the focus from their presidential candidates to less popular figures, such as Nancy Pelosi and the Capitol Hill gang?

Hence this revealing CNN headline from September 25: “Some Democrats worry Pelosi may have acted too soon on impeachment.” As the article detailed, “There is grumbling about what happens if the transcript and report are not the smoking guns that everyone is hyping them to be.”

Indeed, when the transcript of President Trump’s July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released, the “smoking gun” that the Democrats had been hoping for was shown not to be smoking—and actually, it wasn’t even a gun.

Respected election-caller Charlie Cook commented, “I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript … This will not move malleable voters.” In that same deflated spirit, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni warned Democrats of the road ahead:

Any scenario is possible, including one in which impeachment redounds to Trump’s benefit and increases the chances of his re-election, because he paints himself a martyr, eludes conviction in the Senate, frames that as exoneration and watches his fans mobilize and turn out as never before.

Another Times columnist, David Brooks, was even more direct in warning Democrats against impeachment, saying that the American people would conclude that an arrogant capital was seeking to take power away from mere voters. Brooks summed up the gist of the message: “Democratic elites to voters: We don’t trust you. Too many of you are racists!”

Even the Times’ editorial board, the cheerleading flagship of national liberalism, conceded the risk to Democrats: “Mr. Trump has long argued—and continues to argue—that impeachment will benefit him politically. Many Democrats, including Ms. Pelosi, have not disputed that possibility.”

Breitbart News, of course, was more blunt: One of its headlines read, “Democrats Privately Panic Following Transcript, Impeachment Fallout.”

The danger for Democrats, of course, is that impeachment will turn out like the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, when the televised fireworks of September 2018 galvanized Republican voters and helped the GOP gain two Senate seats in the November elections.

So yes, the Democrats have their doubts about their current impeachment course. And yet they also know that it’s vital to stay united. Indeed, they further know, from 1998, that it’s even better to stay united while on the attack. So that’s what they’re doing—they’re acting as an army, going on the offensive.

AOC Blows the Trumpet

On September 25, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sounded the Democrats’ call to arms. Ignoring the obvious words on the page, she tweeted of the just-released Trump-Zelensky transcript, “It’s worse than we thought … We have no choice but to impeach.” As we have learned over the last century, falsehoods get “truthier” with repetition—at least that’s what demagogues strive for.

For its part, the Mainstream Media has been happy to fall in with the Democrats’ assault formation. Of course, reporters have their own wily ways; one favorite MSM tactic is to report on “splits” within Republican ranks, in the hope of wedging them wider.

The hope, of course, is that Sen. Mitt Romney, that opportunistic Trump-hater, can be multiplied—or metastasized. So here’s a helpful headline in the Washington Post: “Cracks emerge among Senate Republicans over Trump urging Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden.” And this headline in Politico: “Republicans twist as Trump’s Ukraine storm rages.” Such stories are notable for their lack of specifics, and yet for the Democrats, they are usable, serving the cause, they hope, of creating more Romney-type renegades.

Yet interestingly, the Democrats are attacking Trump for supposedly doing what they themselves have admitted to doing—namely, pushing Ukraine around. Yes, as we all know, Joe Biden, father of Hunter, bragged in a public forum last year that he had muscled Ukrainian officials: “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.”

In addition, as conservative pundit Marc Thiessen has pointed out, congressional Democrats, too, have sought to muscle Ukraine into changing its policies in order to advance their own political goals.

So yes, without a doubt, Democrats—joined, of course, by the MSM—are going to make an all-out push against Trump. They are finally following through on Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s notorious war whoop from January, “We’re going to impeach the motherf**ker!”

So on September 25, former top Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon was right to put the Democrats’ offensive in an appropriately martial context: “Pelosi’s announcement … was the shot at Fort Sumter.” In other words, Team Trump must be fully mobilized in its own defense.

In the meantime, the Ukraine-related details—more precisely, the allegations—keep coming fast and furious; by now it’s hard to recall that the original report about a “whistleblower” came only on September 18. And yet just in the past week or so, Democrats have worked themselves into a fury. Indeed, every day—seemingly every hour—brings a new accusatory headline, even if oftentimes the story soon falls apart.

Given this level of anything-goes enthusiasm, it matters little that the whistleblower’s complaint, released on September 26, contains no proof of wrongdoing and simply lots of argumentation about policy—which is not, of course, the province of a government underling.

Yes, this is the Deep State in action, and it’s out for blood; Virgil started writing about its stab-in-the-back methods back in December 2016. And so when the New York Times informs us that the whistleblower works for the CIA—the former domain of Trump-hater John Brennan—and is thus “nonpolitical,” well, that’s good for a Virgilian belly laugh. Indeed, when one considers the legal craftsmanship of the report, it’s obvious that the whistleblower had a lot of help in the researching and writing of the document.

Still, as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani observes of the whistleblower, he’s a finger-pointer who doesn’t actually point to anything that he saw first-hand: “He says ‘I was not a direct witness’ and additionally states over 20 times ‘I was told,’ ‘I am concerned,’ ‘I learned,’ and not once did he say ‘I know.’”

Meanwhile, courtesy of Sean Davis at The Federalist, we learn that the online submission form for a whistleblower report was changed in August—just a month before the anti-Trump upload—to eliminate the need for firsthand knowledge of an alleged incident. In other words, the form was changed seemingly for the benefits of a particular whistleblower. That’s a big “tell.” A tell, that is, that others within the government were working to help the whistleblower along. In other words, this wasn’t just an inside job, this was an inside conspiracy.

We can observe that someone who simply passes on gossip is not a whistleblower at all, but, rather, a troublemaker. Or maybe even a Soros-aided conspirator.

We’ll Keep Polling Till We Get the Answer We Want

The Democrats and their media pals know that impeachment is a hard sell; according to a Quinnipiac poll released on September 25, just 37 percent of Americans supported impeaching Trump, while 57 percent said “no.” We might pause over the language of the question, which was simple and straight-forward: “Do you think that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, or don’t you think so?”

Needless to say, a 20-point deficit in the impeachment question is not what the Democrats are looking for—that’s not how to build impeachment momentum. So for them, not liking the answer, it was time for a new question. That is, ask the “I-word” question in a way that gets the desired answer.

Much more to the Democrats’ liking was a poll from YouGov, which found that 55 percent of Americans either “strongly” or “somewhat” support impeachment. That’s more like it, say Democrat activists, one of whom was moved to tweet, “Tide is shifting *very* quickly. 22% of Republicans strongly support impeachment, 10% of Republicans somewhat support impeachment. Only 49% of Republicans oppose impeachment.”

Well, actually, not quite. If we look at the actual language of the question, we can see the contrast with the Quinnipiac poll. That is, the language of the YouGov question has been cooked to get the desired result: “If President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, would you support or oppose impeachment?”

In other words, YouGov is asking—and also, in a way, declaring—if we agree that Trump is guilty, then what should we do?

Another new poll, from Politico/Morning Consult, shows the same syndrome of bias: To get a “good” headline, ask a loaded question. Expect many more such loads to come.

So can the Democrats and the MSM succeed in stampeding the voters using bias-tactics such as this? We’ll have to wait and see; all we know now is that they’re going to give it their best shot.

Happily, in the face of this onslaught, almost all Republicans are sticking together and standing firm; sample tweet from Bill Hagerty, the likely Republican senatorial nominee in Tennessee next year: “The socialists in Washington are trying to impeach our president. I am proud to be endorsed by President @realDonaldTrump and will stand with him against the radical Left.”

Still, Romney and the Never Trump clique have deep pockets, full of money and media mojo; they can offer the proverbial “strange new respect,” and more to any Republican who breaks with Trump and the GOP.

Ukrainegate? Whistleblowergate? Bidengate!

We don’t yet know whether we’re going to see a replay of 1974 (the defending party splintered and defeated) or 1998 (the defending party unified and rewarded).

Yet this much does seem clear: Joe Biden’s presidential candidacy, once seen as an unstoppable dreadnought, is becoming distinctly Titanic-like.

As far back as April, investigative reporter John Solomon was laying out the stakes: “Joe Biden’s 2020 Ukrainian nightmare: A closed probe is revived.” Solomon pointed out that the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings was paying Hunter Biden’s outfit as much as $166,000 a month. For what, exactly?

In fact, Solomon has been writing knowingly about Russia and Ukraine for years; just on September 26 he cast further doubt on Joe Biden’s alibis.

As Michael Goodwin asked the other day in the New York Post, “Would Hunter Biden have gotten that job if his father were not vice president? Ditto for a sweetheart investment deal Hunter Biden got from the Chinese government.”

Indeed, the reality of Hunter Biden’s involvement in the international influence game is so obvious—hiding in plain sight, one might say—that even the Washington Post has to include sentences such as this: “Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.”

We can see: The case against the Bidens is right there, not actually hidden at all.

Some journalistic voices are urging a cease-and-desist on printing the truth about the Bidens; as one wrote recently, “Reporters should stop helping Donald Trump spread lies about Joe Biden and Ukraine.”

Yet the Biden candidacy is so ripe with juice—or so ripe with something—that reporters can’t stay away. For instance, Politico’s Ben Schreckinger has been working the Biden beat hard, coming up with investigative doozies such as, “Biden’s brother touted Biden Cancer Initiative ties in investment pitch: James Biden suggested the former vice president’s anti-cancer efforts could benefit potential investors, a litigant says. His spokesman denies it.”

Indeed, one prominent journo has concluded that Biden will end up as collateral damage in the coming impeach-o-rama; it’s hard to find more vivid phrasing than that of the Washington Post’s David von Drehle:

It was a terrible day for Biden, because while he was winning labor votes on the picket line, Democrats in Washington were freshly lathered over impeaching the president. And it appears they are going to feed Biden into a wood chipper. [Emphasis added]

Wood chipper? Ouch! It seems almost unnecessary to add that it’s hard to become the 46th president if you’ve been mashed into bloody fragments.

In other words, for all the Democrats’ cleverness, the one seemingly sure result of their new impeachment push is the wood-chipping of the man who has been regarded as their strongest presidential candidate.

Of course, if the name Bidengate were to stick—and it should—then maybe Biden was never, in reality, all that strong.

Or, to put the matter another way, maybe Trump is stronger than most observers have been willing to admit."

ALEX BERG: There are a lot of questions about who else in the president’s circle who should be held accountable for the Ukraine call and what happened there. Do you think Attorney General Bill Barr should also be impeached?

REP. MAXINE WATERS: Let me just say that Attorney General Barr has defined himself as being just the president’s lawyer, not the people’s lawyer that he’s supposed to be. [He’s] willing to do whatever it takes to protect the president. He’s not a credible human being. His name has come up in this whole issue about the president’s call and work that’s been done with Ukraine to try to pressure them and get information about Biden. I know, given what he’s done in the past, that he’s guilty in being involved by either assisting Giuliani or doing other kinds of things to try and get Ukraine’s president to come out and get dirt on Biden.

ZACH STAFFORD: Beyond Bill Barr, we’d like to talk about Vice President Mike Pence. Trump recently said, “I think you should ask for Vice President Pence’s conversation” regarding Ukraine. What was your reaction to that and what do you think should happen with Mike Pence now?

REP. WATERS: First of all, we have seen that no matter what the president does, they come up with a kind of messaging to defend him. No matter what it is, none of them have had the courage, the patriotism, or the guts to stand up for what is right for our country. So I expect that Pence is part of this conspiracy to try to get Ukraine to do something in a fake investigation and come out with some dirt on Biden. I’m looking forward to that coming out in the hearings that will be done by the Judiciary Committee as they take up the impeachment resolution."

Waters also defended the “whistleblower” by stating the individual issued the complaint against the president due to being “concerned about this country”:

However, Breitbart News reported Thursday that the complaint “contains no first-hand knowledge of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and relies entirely on leaks by ‘White House officials.'”

The report goes on to state that the “whistleblower” admitted in the document, “I do not know which side initiated the call.”

On Wednesday, Breitbart News reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General ruled that the “whistleblower” had a political bias, but the inspector general still found the anonymous individual “credible.”

However, President Trump defended himself on Twitter Friday by questioning if the “whistleblower” had been fed information to leak:

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019

On Wednesday, Waters claimed that following President Trump’s inauguration in 2017, she knew he would be impeached.

“I started a long time ago, right after the president was inaugurated, talking about impeachment and saying that he was dishonorable, he was a conman, we could not trust him,” she said during an interview on MSNBC’s All In.

Waters also accused the president of being “brazen” and “disrespectful” of the Constitution, adding that “it does not even measure up to what we have just discovered over the past few days about him and his attempt to leverage and get the president of Ukraine to do his bidding and find dirt on his political opponent, and so all of this is different.”"

The speaker, a professed Catholic, added:

These bans violate the Constitution. They ignore basic morality. They imperil the health and well-being of countless women.

She said this is “a very sad time for our country,” adding she says this “with great sorrow and prayerfulness.”

“I never thought that we would see a president take the actions that he has,” the Speaker said. “In fact, I don’t think our Founders ever thought a president would do such a thing.

McCarthy noted at National Review on Thursday that then-President Barack Obama’s administration asked Ukraine to investigate Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, in 2016.

McCarthy notes the double standard — that Democrats want to impeach Trump for doing what Obama did — and which they have been telling the world for years was necessary to do to protect American national security.

As House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told NBC News in March, his investigation into Trump dealt with “a present threat to our national security — whether the president and anybody around him are compromised by a foreign power.” If Trump colluded with Russia, or if the Russians had compromising information about him, they could hold enormous influence over the Trump administration — hence the need for investigation.

That is how Democrats defended the decision by intelligence and law enforcement officials under President Obama to conduct surveillance of Trump campaign associates — without warning Trump himself in a “defensive” briefing.

McCarthy notes that “the Obama administration’s law-enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort” in the middle of the 2016 presidential election.

He cites his recent book, Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency, recently excerpted on Fox News, which reports that Obama administration officials urged Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate Manafort — which amounted to “effectively meddling in the American presidential election.” The results were soon clear: leaks about Manafort’s activities in Ukraine began to appear in the U.S. media, spun in the worst possible light. He was replaced at the Trump campaign and became a target in the phony “collusion” narrative.

McCarthy notes the glaring double standard: “When the Obama administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, “But look how corrupt Paul Manafort was!” When the Trump administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, “Abuse of power — impeach him!”

Two key differences: there is actual evidence of former Vice President Joe Biden extorting the Ukrainian government; and Trump has released the transcript of his conversation with the new Ukrainian president. Only one administration has been transparent.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Friday called for a “word for word” transcript of President Trump’s conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky following closed-door briefings with intelligence officials.

The Senate Intelligence Committee member met with acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire and the intelligence community’s inspector general Michael Atkinson on Thursday and concluded that the whistleblower’s complaint – which is based entirely on hearsay – indicates that an “official word-for-word transcript of the call” exists.

“If so, it should be provided to Congress for review. Congress has a constitutional oversight duty. It’s important that we understand who took actions to hide details of the call with Zelensky and how high those actions reached,” Feinstein said, according to the Hill.

She added that she found the complaint “highly credible.”

“It suggests that the president used his office to demand political favors from a foreign country and that White House personnel knew this was wrong and tried to cover it up by burying details of the call with Ukrainian President Zelensky,” Feinstein stated.

Feinstein’s call comes days after Trump’s authorization to release the “complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of the conversation, which was done on Wednesday. The conversation showed no quid pro quo or pressure, as several GOP lawmakers made abundantly clear.

“President Trump asked about Ukraine investigating ‘Crowdstrike’ (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond ‘Crowdstrike,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a statement following the transcript’s release.

“Only thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden’s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor’s investigation of Biden’s son,” he continued.

“I’ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said in a statement.

“The Ukrainian President admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further,” he added.

“Absolutely ZERO grounds for impeachment and I agree w/ the President that US-Ukraine should investigate,” Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) wrote. “This is absurd how Congressional Dems & many in media are trying to spin this all!”

Feinstein’s call also follows a flurry of remarks from “transcript truthers” – including several high-profile Hollywood leftists – who “spread a host of conspiracy theories involving the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky,” as Breitbart News detailed:

“We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100 percent confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election,” she stated.

“That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale,” she added."

He also thinks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has long resisted the call for an impeachment inquiry, is just caving to pressure from the extreme left of her Party, specifically the “squad” consisting of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

“I don’t think anything’s really changed at all, actually,” Burchett said on National Public Radio’s (NPR) All Things Considered. “I’m still opposed to the impeachment inquiry.”

“I think Speaker Pelosi is – I realize she’s got to yield to her very liberal base, and they’re four ladies who have a great deal of control,” Burchett said.

Burchett said that it wouldn’t have been left to a whistleblower if Trump had done something criminal on his phone call with the Ukrainian president that included a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I think if you just read the transcript of the conversation – I mean, you have to ask yourself why there’s more than a dozen people who had firsthand knowledge of that conversation who were there monitoring it and none of them have come forward to say that there was a problem with it,” Burchett said.

NPR host Audie Cornish implied in her interview with Burchett that Republicans were shifting their view of Trump because of the latest accusation against him but Burchett pointed out that one outspoken Republican is the failed presidential candidate and Trump critic Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT).

“Now, many of your Republican colleagues have been talking about their concerns,” Cornish said. “Do you see any shift happening?”

“No, ma’am. I don’t,” Burchett said. “I think that you’re talking about, apparently, an unnamed U.S. senator, but I think he’s just a disgruntled person who ran for president and didn’t…”

“So you’re referring to Senator Mitt Romney,” Cornish said.

“Yes, of course. Yes, ma’am,” Burchett said. “He didn’t get appointed to a position. It’s clearly spoiled milk.”

Cornish asked if Burchett had any questions about Trump’s phone conversation.

“Well, I would like to question Mr. Schiff why he opened up – this is a very serious accusation, and it’s very disrupting to the process because we’re not doing anything,” Burchett said. “We’re not addressing any of the concerns that people have – health care, immigration.”

Burchett said the new charges against Trump are the same as the now-failed Russian collusion charges.

“Nothing has changed,” Burchett said. “It’s – frankly, it’s a three-ring circus.”

“It’s the same committee,” Burchett said. “It’s the same people, ma’am.”

“And it’s the same, and they’re going to draw the same conclusion,” Burchett said. “If there’s – this is not an impeachable offense.”

“The committee that meets is the same committee that’s been meeting since I was first elected, and they have not done one dadgum thing productive out of that committee that they’ve been assigned to do,” Burchett said. “They’ve just been hearing over this and rehashing old things.”

“We are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton, and until the Republicans free themselves of hatred our country will suffer,” Pelosi said in the clip.

“They are driven by hatred,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) declared. “They hate Bill and Hillary Clinton so much, they will stop at nothing to bring him down.”

“Impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election, and one of the reasons we all feel so angry about what they are doing is that they are ripping from us, they are ripping us under our votes,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said. “They are telling us that our votes don’t count.”

The flashback even features Joe Biden (D), who warned Congress to be careful and make “darn sure” that they are impeaching based on “principle not politics.”

Their remarks stand in stark contrast to their recent remarks.

Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump on Wednesday.

“The President must be held accountable; no one is above the law,” she said:

Waters, who accused Republicans of being driven by “hatred” in the flashback video, recently thanked millennials for “staying woke” and supporting her endless calls for impeaching the president.

“Shout out to all of the millennials for staying woke and supporting me all this time I’ve been warning Congress about Trump and why we needed to impeach him,” Waters wrote. “Remember what I’ve always said: If you fight, you can win!”:

The report by The Federalist’s Sean Davis raises questions about the intelligence community’s role amid a whistleblower complaint submitted against President Trump in August 2019, alleging he acted improperly when asking the president of Ukraine to assist in investigations into the origins of the Russia collusion allegations and alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Davis’s report said a new whistleblower complaint form did not require potential whistleblowers who wish to have their concerns expedited to Congress to have direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing they are reporting.

The new version of the whistleblower complaint form allowed employees to file complaints even if they have zero direct knowledge of underlying evidence and only “heard about” wrongdoing from others, according to Davis’s report.

According to Davis, a previous version of the whistleblower complaint form declared that any complaint must contain only first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoing and that complaints that provide only hearsay, rumor, or gossip would be rejected.

The whistleblower complaint against Trump, which was filed August 12, 2010, alleged Trump broke the law during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but acknowledged that the person making the complaint was “not a direct witness” to the wrongdoing he claimed Trump had committed.

“The [Intelligence Community Inspector General] cannot transmit information via the [Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act] based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing,” the form had previously stated under the bolded heading “FIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.” “This includes information received from another person, such as when an employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing.”

“If you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, [the Intelligence Community Inspector General] will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA,” the previous form said.

As Davis noted in his report:

The Ukraine call complaint against Trump is riddled not with evidence directly witnessed by the complainant, but with repeated references to what anonymous officials allegedly told the complainant: “I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials,” “officials have informed me,” “officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me,” “the White House officials who told me this information,” “I was told by White House officials,” “the officials I spoke with,” “I was told that a State Department official,” “I learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “One White House official described this act,” “Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me,” “I also learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “The U.S. officials characterized this meeting,” “multiple U.S. officials told me,” “I learned from U.S. officials,” “I also learned from a U.S. official,” “several U.S. officials told me,” “I heard from multiple U.S. officials,” and “multiple U.S. officials told me.”

Davis added:

The repeated references to information the so-called whistleblower never witnessed clearly run afoul of the original ICIG requirements for “urgent concern” submissions. The change to the ‘urgent concern’ submission form was first highlighted on Twitter by researcher Stephen McIntyre.

The complaint filed against Trump, in addition to using second-hand sources, cites news articles as proof for many of the allegations.

The complaint also makes a number of false accusations against Trump that have been debunked by the transcript the White House released of a call between Trump and Zelensky.

For example, the complaint alleged Trump demanded that Ukraine physically return multiple servers potentially related to ongoing investigations of foreign interference in the 2016 elections, but such a request was not made.

The complaint also falsely alleged that Trump told Zelensky that he should keep the current prosecutor general at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, in his current position in the country, but Trump also did not make such a request.

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel found the complaint to be deficient and not required to be submitted to Congress: “The complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community. Rather, the complaint arises out of a confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received secondhand. The question is whether such a complaint falls within the statutory definition of ‘urgent concern’ that the law requires the DNI to forward to the intelligence committees. We conclude that it does not.”"

One of several themes is financing tied to Google, whose Google Capital led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike. Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party.

CrowdStrike was mentioned by Trump in his call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, reportedly helped draft CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC’s allegedly hacked server.

On behalf of the DNC and Clinton’s campaign, Perkins Coie also paid the controversial Fusion GPS firm to produce the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

CrowdStrike is a California-based cybersecurity technology company co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch.

Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia. The Council in turn is financed by Google Inc.

In a perhaps unexpected development, another Atlantic Council funder is Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Those allegations were the subject of Trump’s inquiry with Zelemsky related to Biden. The Biden allegations concern significant questions about Biden’s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period when Hunter Biden received $50,000 a month from Burisma.

Besides Google and Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros’s Open Society Foundations as well as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department.

Google, Soros’s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower’s complaint alleging Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 presidential race.

The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the whistleblower’s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower’s own claims, as Breitbart News documented.

One key section of the so-called whistleblower’s document claims that “multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.”

This was allegedly to follow up on Trump’s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the “cases” mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower’s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.

Even though the statement was written in first person – “multiple U.S. officials told me” – it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

That footnote reads:

In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.

The so-called whistleblower’s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:

Write that Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko “also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.”

Document that Trump adviser Rudi Giuliani “had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.”

Bolster the charge that, “I also learned from a U.S. official that ‘associates’ of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.” The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, “I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.”

The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a “joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.”

BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.

The OCCRP and BuzzFeed “joint investigation” resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump’s political rivals.

The so-called whistleblower’s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.

Together with Soros’s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are “disputed.”

Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute’s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros’ Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy.

CrowdStrike and DNC servers

CrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky.

According to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people…The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

In his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not “obtain or examine” the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia.

The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI.

In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered “multiple requests at different levels,” to review the DNC’s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a “highly respected private company”—a reference to CrowdStrike—would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified.

A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC.

“The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” the official was quoted by the news media as saying.

“This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,” the official continued.

Biden, Ukraine and Burisma

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving Burisma, the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

Biden publically boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

Yoshiko M. Herrera, a Russia and Eurasian policy expert from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was quoted by the Washington Post saying that Biden’s position was “a conflict of interest even if it doesn’t break any laws.”

“Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,” Herrera stated. “Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.”

A New York Times editorial posited that Hunter Biden’s role in the board of Burisma undermined his father’s credibility in Ukraine issues.

The newspaper opined:

Sadly, the credibility of Mr. Biden’s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices. A spokesman for the son, Hunter Biden, argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance. That may be so. But Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine. It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father’s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."

The letter marks one instance of what the Washington Post reported Saturday as a wide-scale reclassification of emails sent to Clinton's private email by as many as 130 current and former senior State Department officials.

The recent change in the investigation was an effort to harass diplomats for doing their job, several people told the Post, as Trump had made Clinton's use of private email servers during her tenure as secretary of state a staple of his 2016 presidential campaign rhetoric.

Trump weighed in on Clinton's emails again Sunday night, slamming her for ""33,000 emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found.""

The report of the intensifying email probe against Trump's former political rival comes days after the release of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential 2020 political rival, and his son, Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

House Democrats this past week launched a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.

The former official told CNN he first received a letter by mail from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security in January 2018, years after leaving the government. The letter alerted him that some of his emails sent on the unclassified system should have been sent on a classified system.

Then on August 5, another letter from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security was sent -- this time in an email -- informing him of the change in status of the emails.

""It has been determined that, at the time they were sent, a number of these emails contained classified information which were not property marked as such,"" the letter stated.

The official told CNN that it appeared to him the emails were reviewed again, but with a stricter criteria because more emails were flagged in the second letter that the agency said should have been labeled classified. The official said he has talked to multiple former and current State Department colleagues who received a new letter and that there is a lot of confusion among them about why this is happening now.

Current and former officials told the Post dozens of officials have been contacted in recent weeks by investigators at the State Department.

Those targeted, including senior officials as well as others in lower-level jobs, have been notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now are potential security violations, the newspaper said.

While a former senior US official familiar with the email investigation told the Post that the email investigation is a way for Republicans ""to keep the Clinton email issue alive,"" senior State Department officials countered to the newspaper that they are following standard protocol in an investigation that began before Trump became President.

An FBI investigation found that of the 30,000 emails Clinton provided in 2014 to the State Department from her server, 110 contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. The agency did not recommend charges against Clinton, though then-FBI Director James Comey rebuked her and her aides for being ""extremely careless."""

(CNN) President Donald Trump once hailed himself as the "" most transparent president ever ."" This week, however, we learned that Trump's team took unprecedented steps to hide readouts of his conversations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russian President Vladimir Putin and members of the Saudi royal family. (The White House has only confirmed that it moved a readout of the President's call with Zelensky to a special server that's supposed to be used for codeword-level intelligence.)

The impact of this revelation on US national security has already been devastating. While the House of Representatives investigates whether Trump violated the Constitution in allegedly seeking help from a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 presidential elections, national security officials need to manage the adverse impacts of the President's actions in real time, all while trying to do their day jobs.

Foreign counterparts are also less likely to be forthcoming with the President and other US officials if they're worried that readouts of their communications may one day end up in news reports or as part of a congressional investigation.

Red flag alert

White House officials and the President should spend their time mitigating counterintelligence risks -- not adding to them.

And yet, since the 2016 campaign, Trump and his team's activities have heightened counterintelligence concerns. The whistleblower complaint alleging that the White House hid records of Trump's conversations with foreign officials by storing them in a highly classified computer system isn't helping matters.

But it's not the first potential breach. In other cases, the White House reportedly failed to document conversations with world leaders in the first place. These activities raise serious red flags, because they could mean that foreign governments know more about the President, along with his comments and intentions, than key members of his own government. That gives them leverage to manipulate or blackmail Trump, especially if the President said something that was incriminating or embarrassing.

Here's a case in point: When Trump met with two senior Russian officials in 2017, he told them he was ""unconcerned"" about the Kremlin's 2016 election interference because, he claimed, the US did the same thing, according to the Washington Post . While US officials were working to secure our elections, the Russians knew that the President was unconcerned and that if this statement became public it could be damaging to him. Trump was directly undercutting his team's critical work, while offering the Russians leverage over him.

Home team disadvantage

Failing to document presidential conversations is a violation of the Presidential Records Act and failing to distribute readouts -- whether verbally or in writing -- hamstrings the President's team in real ways, while also creating counterintelligence risks.

In the rough transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky, the US President said, ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."" But the Justice Department issued a statement on Wednesday that said, ""The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son."" If the White House failed to give Barr a readout of a call in which he was designated, by name, as a point of contact for follow-up, we don't know what other key conversations the President has failed to relay to members of his own Cabinet.

By hiding the transcript, Trump's team also hindered the ability of our intelligence community to do their jobs effectively. Authorized intelligence analysts need to know what the President said to a foreign official, otherwise they may hear about the President's comments during their intelligence collection on foreign sources and have no way of knowing if it's accurate and whether to pass it on.

Small group involved

News that the White House didn't give a readout of the July 25 meeting to key officials, while Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was put in touch with the Ukrainians, probably just furthers the signal globally that the President prefers to keep a small group involved in doing his bidding rather than engaging actual experts and official channels. The President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been accused of leaving the former Secretary of State in the dark when it comes to meeting with foreign leaders, and the whistleblower's complaint likely adds to perceptions that working through official channels like the Department of Justice aren't always the President's preferred course of action.

While the Justice Department said Barr didn't get a readout of the call, the whistleblower complaint alleges two State Department officials -- US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker -- met with the Ukrainians the day after the call to ""navigate"" the President's demands of Zelensky. Shortly after, Volker put a Ukrainian official in touch with Giuliani but not with Barr.

According to the whistleblower, Pompeo's senior staff member, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the counselor for the Department of State, was also listening in (an allegation State denies), so, if he did, it is likely that he gave Pompeo a readout along with Sondland and Volker, given their reported activities following up on the President's demands a day after the call.

What we don't yet know is whether key career diplomats at the State Department were looped in, like our acting ambassador ( charge d'affaires ) at the Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. But what is clear is that while Trump told Zelensky that Barr and Giuliani would call him -- only Giuliani was put in touch with the Ukrainians.

The State Department confirmed weeks ago that it put Giuliani in touch with the Ukrainians. And the whistleblower complaint only furthers the perception that the President's friends -- like Giuliani -- get the readouts and support they need while key US officials don't. That could further lead other governments to stop working through vetted, official channels and just call Giuliani or another one of the President's inner personal circle to follow up on calls and meetings.

Day jobs matter

While the Trump administration prepares to deal with congressional investigations, they also have day jobs to do. Whether they respond to or stonewall congressional subpoenas, requests and depositions, the impeachment inquiry will be a drain on resources -- especially for officials working on key issues like Ukraine.

Their efforts should be focused on important bilateral work, like deterring Russian aggression and trying to stop the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. Because of the President's actions, and the alleged activities detailed in the whistleblower complaint, US officials will need to divert critical time and attention to responding to the investigations, while America's enemies and allies alike will know that US officials are distracted."

In a highly unusual letter to the major networks — including CNN — on Sunday, the Biden campaign said booking Giuliani does a disservice to viewers.

The letter from Biden officials Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield says ""we ask that you no longer book him on your air."" Barring that, the Biden campaign wants ""an equivalent amount of time"" to be provided ""to a surrogate for the Biden campaign.""

UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IS PUBLIC! It is ALL rumor, gossip, hearsay. NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING! I recommend reading it. In the alternative, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a picture that fully describes the whistleblower & his report. Mo pic.twitter.com/OYHmoRpUgv — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) September 26, 2019

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. on Thursday at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Brooks elaborated on his feelings about the allegations, which he said could be tied to 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) supporters.

“Elizabeth Warren in my judgment is just about guaranteed to be the Democrat nominee for president, OK?” Brooks said. “And there’s probably a number of people who support Elizabeth Warren that in part were either behind the disclosure of this information or are currently promoting it today in order to enhance Elizabeth Warren’s stature vis-à-vis, Joe Biden.”

According to the Alabama Republican, Warren meets the requirements of the modern Democratic Party in both identity and ideology.

“Let’s look at who Joe Biden is, OK?” he continued. “He is a white male who is a liberal. In today’s Democratic Party, that doesn’t cut it. On a sexist level, the Democratic Party basically says we want women, not men. And Joe Biden is a man. So that doesn’t fit that identity politics item that the Democrat Party fosters on the American people. Additionally, Joe Biden is a mere liberal. The Democrats of today insist on pure socialist.”

“And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, the third principle argument that they use is based on race,” Brooks added. “They are opposed generally to the election or nomination of Caucasians. And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, she’s claimed that she’s a Native American.”

Those criteria, according to Brooks are who Democrat voters want representing their party on the ballot.

“Those are their three themes, and those are the three themes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to beat a 20-year white male liberal incumbent congressman in New York.”

There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong.

The whistleblower

An anonymous government worker - with access to White House officials - who filed an official complaint against the President claiming that multiple officials had concerns that Trump was using his public office to seek personal political gain from a foreign power not just through his July 25 phone conversation with Zelensky but through emissaries including Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as, possibly, Attorney General Bill Barr. The complaint also alleges a coverup by White House staffers who sought to bury Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President by placing a rough transcript of it in a computer system reserved for highly classified material.

Donald Trump, President of the United States

Just as he was trying to move on from allegations his campaign colluded with Russians against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Trump was ramping up efforts to get Ukraine to stir up trouble for his prospective 2020 challenger Biden. He used official channels to ask the Ukrainian President to look into the Biden family, openly asking Zelensky for a favor during a phone call on July 25 and then suggested his attorney meet with Ukrainian officials. In the July 25 phone call, the Ukrainian President mentioned plans to buy US-made Javelin missiles -- which he needs to help guard against potential Russian provocations. At the very same time, Trump was sitting on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, which he has argued was on hold while he leaned on European countries to give more to Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine

Here is Zelensky shooting the television series ""Servant of the People"" where he plays the role of the President of Ukraine. He was later elected President of Ukraine.

A comedian turned politician, Zelensky's job before being elected the President of Ukraine was playing the President of Ukraine on television. His country is in the midst of a years-long standoff with Russia over Crimea, an area Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. Zelensky is also dealing with a war against pro-Russian separatists. But his intentions -- and whether he is pro-Russian or pro-West -- have been something both sides have been trying to determine. His desire for military aid from the US is unquestioned. He flattered Trump during their phone call in July and promised a fair look at the Biden family after Trump asked for an investigation. But Zelensky clearly does not want to get involved in US politics , and said after the White House released its transcript of the July 25 call that he didn't think his side would be included.

Rudy Giuliani, Trump attorney

Giuliani drove Trump's focus on Ukraine and the Bidens.

The former New York mayor, now the President's personal attorney and staunch defender on cable news, is at the center of the Ukraine scandal . He has said he went to Ukraine because was trying to undermine the beginnings of the Russia investigation and protect Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for tax fraud linked to his business dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has said he then pivoted after learning about claims concerning Joe Biden's actions as Vice President, including his public calls in 2016 for a prosecutor in Ukraine to be fired. Giuliani claims that was improper because, at the time, Biden's son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company that had once been under investigation in Ukraine. After pushing the story about Biden for months, Giuliani ultimately met with a top aide to Zelensky in Madrid, days after the July 25 phone call where Trump asked Zelensky to hear Giuliani out.

William Barr, US attorney general

Barr has remained quiet on the Ukraine scandal, but he was mentioned repeatedly by Trump in the July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

Barr took over as head of the Department of Justice in February 2019, and oversaw the official release of the Mueller report summing up the government's investigation into claims that Russia engaged with the Trump campaign to tamper with the 2016 election. Trump asked the Ukrainian President to talk with Barr as part of an investigation he said Barr was conducting. Barr has remained quiet about any involvement in Ukraine, but Democrats have said they expect him to be called to testify

Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of state

Mike Pompeo is not mentioned by name in the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by House Democrats.

Mike Pence, vice president of the US

When Trump could not attend a meeting with Zelensky in September, he sent Pence instead.

When Trump canceled a September trip to Poland during which he was supposed to meet with Zelensky, Pence went instead. The vice president told reporters after the meeting that he did not discuss Biden, but that he talked to Zelensky in great detail about Trump's interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and also about US aid to Ukraine.

Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire faced scrutiny about the whistleblower complaint on Capitol Hill.

A retired vice admiral and former Navy SEAL, Maguire stepped into his role when former DNI Dan Coats resigned in August. Maguire initially withheld the whistleblower complaint from Congress because his attorneys counseled him that Trump was not part of the intelligence community. Weeks into the job, he's already been called to testify before Congress over the Ukraine scandal. In that congressional testimony he defended the whistleblower for coming forward.

Pat Cipollone, White House counsel

Pat Cipollone has been White House counsel since 2018.

Alongside the allegations about Trump's effort to influence the Ukrainian President against Biden are the whistleblower's allegation that White House lawyers sought to cover things up by burying the transcript of the call in a server reserved for highly classified information. Cipollone, as White House counsel, was also involved in the recommendation that Maguire should withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress, according to the Washington Post

Adam Schiff, House Intelligence Committee Chairman

Schiff's intelligence committee will likely lead the most visible impeachment inquiry.

A former federal prosecutor, Schiff is a confidant of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has designated the California congressman to take the lead in the Democrats' inquiry into the whistleblower complaint. He is a frequent target of Trump, who refers to him as ""liddle"" Adam Schiff.

Devin Nunes, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member

Nunes has been one of Trump's most vocal supporters.

If Schiff is the prosecutor, Nunes -- also from California -- will play the role of Trump's defender. Long an apologist for the President on the Russia investigation, Nunes has pivoted to defending Trump on Ukraine. With his seat next to Schiff, he will play an important role.

Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives

Pelosi had been cool to pursuing impeachment until the whistleblower story broke.

Pelosi is in her second stint as the top elected Democrat in the country, and nothing will move forward on impeachment without her support. After months of slowing calls by Democrats for impeachment proceedings over the findings of the Mueller report, Pelosi quickly moved to change course and begin official impeachment proceedings after the substance of Trump's Ukraine actions as detailed in the whistleblower complaint became clear.

Yuriy Lutsenko, former Ukrainian General Prosecutor

The former top prosecutor in Ukraine, Lustenko had complained about the US ambassador.

A holdover from the administration that preceded Zelensky in Ukraine, Lutsenko was Giuliani's original target to influence toward an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma. Lutsenko said in May he had looked to reanimate the investigation, but also that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. His comments to a reporter for The Hill that there should be an investigation into whether Ukrainians had meddled in the 2016 US election may have helped fuel Giuliani's focus on Ukraine. He resigned in August.

Viktor Shokin, former Ukraine prosecutor general

Biden, along with other Western officials, wanted Shokin fired back in 2016.

Shokin was named Ukraine's top prosecutor under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in 2015 and began facing criticism for what was seen as an unwillingness to prosecute elite corruption. Biden, who handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration, put public and private pressure on the Ukraine government to fire Shokin. The Obama administration threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Poroshenko took action. Trump has seized on this to accuse Biden of wrongdoing -- despite no evidence of this -- and the international calls for Shokin's firing at the time. The Ukraine legislature voted to oust Shokin in March 2016. Biden's last visit to Ukraine before Shokin's firing was in December 2015, though he held a phone call with Poroshenko before the dismissal.

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman

Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas (second and third from left) are associates of Rudy Giuliani and were charged with violating campaign finance laws.

Soviet-born American associates of Giuliani who helped him in Ukraine but also had business interests there, Fruman and Parnas were arrested on campaign finance violation allegations in the US. It has since been reported by CNN that federal authorities are scrutinizing their business ties to Giuliani. Their alleged campaign finance misdeeds include making campaign contributions using so-called ""straw donors."" They donated $325,000 to a Trump-aligned super PAC in 2018 and have put pictures of themselves with the President on social media. The super PAC, America First ACTION, said in a statement it never spent the money.

Vladimir Putin, President of Russia

Putin's Russia annexed Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine, in 2014.

Putin is not directly related to the whistleblower complaint, but his shadow looms over this entire story and generally over Trump's presidency. The reason Zelensky and Ukraine want the military aid is their standoff with Russia over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Andriy Yermak, aide to Ukrainian President

A top adviser to Zelensky, Yermak met with Giuliani in Madrid a week after Trump's call with Zelensky. According to the whistleblower complaint, various US officials said this meeting was a ""direct follow-up"" to the July 25th call.

T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department Counselor

A West Point classmate and business partner of Pompeo, Brechbuhl is mentioned in the complaint as having listened to Trump's call with Zelensky as it occurred. The State Department has denied he listened in.

Kurt Volker, US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations

Kurt Volker is the administration's point person on Ukraine.

Formerly the administration's point person on Ukraine, Volker is a key figure in this story. He's mentioned in the whistleblower complaint as trying to advise Ukrainian officials on how to deal with Trump and Giuliani. It was Volker who apparently set up the meeting between Giuliani and Yerkmak, Zelensky's aide. He was essentially a volunteer, however, and still works for BGR group, a Washington lobbying firm that has represented the government of Ukraine. Volker resigned his position and was the first witness called by House investigators in their impeachment probe. Text messages he gave three House committees showed concern among diplomats that the Trump administration was withholding funding over Trump's demands for an investigation of his political rivals.

Gordon Sondland, United States Ambassador to the EU

Sonland is mentioned in the Whistleblower complaint alongside Volker.

Mentioned in the complaint alongside Volker, the two were said by the whistleblower to be advising the Ukrainian leadership about how to deal with Trump and Giuliani. In text messages released by Volker , Sonalnd tells a US diplomat concerned the President is withholding funding in exchange for an investigation that he is mistaken about the President's intentions.

William B. Taylor, chargé d'affaires for US Embassy in Ukraine

Taylor was ambassador to Ukraine during the George W. Bush administration, but after some posting in Washington and the Middle East, is back at the embassy in a different role. After the recall of Yovanovitch, he was intimately involved in talks between Volker, Sondland and Zelensky's aides. He repeatedly raised concerns in text messages that the administration was withholding funding in exchange for an investigation of Trump's political rivals.

Marie Yovanovitch, former US Ambassador to Ukraine

Trump said the former ambassador to Ukraine, whom his administration recalled, was ""bad news.""

After complaints by Lutsenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor, and Republicans in the US, Yovanovitch was recalled from her post. A career member of the foreign service who has served in ambassadorships under three presidents, she was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016 and recalled in May 2019, prompting Democrats to accuse the White House of a "" political hit job ."" In the phone call with Zelensky, Trump disparaged her, calling her ""bad news"" and saying, ""she's going to go through some things."" In damning testimony on Capitol Hill , Yovanovitch said it was her understanding she was targeted by Giuliani and she issued a dire warning about diplomacy during the Trump administration.

George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State

career foreign service officer , he is now the top policy official for Eurasia, including Ukraine. He was number two in the US embassy to Ukraine from 2015 to 2018, so his experience there spans time under Trump, as well as when then-Vice President Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to do more to combat corruption.

Fiona Hill, former top White House Russia adviser

A notable critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hill officially resigned from her position with the National Security Council as Trump's top Russia policy adviser in August. She is mentioned in text messages given to House Democrats as part of the impeachment inquiry by former US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker.

John Durham, US Attorney for District of Connecticut

US attorney John Durham was brought in by Barr to lead an after-action probe of the Russia investigation.

Mentioned in the whistleblower complaint because he was tapped by Barr to lead a probe into the beginnings of the Russia investigation and, according to the DOJ, was investigating Ukraine.

Michael Atkinson, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community

The whistleblower complaint was originally delivered to Michael Atkinson.

As ICIG, Atkinson was the first to receive the whistleblower complaint . He informed Congress that it was initially being withheld from the House Intelligence committee despite his determination that it represented an ""urgent concern."" He told the committee he was at an ""impasse"" with Maguire over the complaint and whether Congress should be informed about its existence or its contents. He was appointed to his position by Trump after many years at the Department of Justice.

Stephen Engel, Director, Office of Legal Counsel

A top attorney at the Department of Justice, it was Engel's job to review whether the whistleblower complaint was an ""urgent concern"" from the perspective of the DOJ. He recommended keeping the complaint at the DOJ for a possible criminal probe instead of sending to Congress, as the law would seem to require. That set up the showdown between Atkinson, the inspector general and Maguire, the acting DNI.

General counsel at an intelligence agency

Even before the whistleblower filed the complaint, the White House was aware of the whistleblower's concerns because an intelligence agency's general counsel notified lawyers at the Justice Department and the White House after the whistleblower flagged them through an anonymous process, according to The New York Times

John Eisenberg, a deputy White House counsel

The first person at the White House notified about concerns ultimately raised by the whistleblower. He and the intelligence agency's general counsel contacted the Justice Department together, according to The Times

John Demers, head of the Justice Department's national security division; Jeffrey Rosen, deputy attorney general; Brian Benczkowski, head of DOJ criminal division

Demers was the first attorney at the DOJ notified of concerns about Trump's conduct raised by the whistleblower and discussed it with colleagues Rosen and Benczkowski at Department of Justice, according to The New York Times . It's not clear when or how Barr was notified.

Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, attorneys for the whistleblower

Bakaj worked in the CIA inspector general's office before being forced out in 2014. A subsequent report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general cleared him of any wrongdoing, according to Yahoo News . Now in private practice, Bakaj and Zaid, who work together on whistleblower and security clearance cases, are representing the whistleblower

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Jordan on Ukraine scandal,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/29/politics/jim-jordan-ukraine-fact-check-jake-tapper-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, and CNN's Jake Tapper got into a contentious exchange Sunday after the lawmaker made false and misleading claims about the unfolding Ukraine drama that has led to an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

During a tense interview with Tapper on ""State of The Union,"" the Ohio Republican attempts to give his spin on the drama, making unsubstantiated claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, though there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either.

On Jordan's claims about the Bidens

""The vice president's son gets paid $50,000 a month and gets hired by a company in an industry he has no experience in and oh that's fine?"" Jordan says, referring to Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. ""Try taking that message to the American people ... When they see the vice president's son getting paid $50,000 a month in a field, in an industry he has no experience in ... And then when the company that's paying that money is under investigation, guess what? Daddy comes running to the rescue. The vice president of the United States comes running in and says, 'Fire that prosecutor.' ""

""That's not what happened. Sir, sir, that's not what happened,"" Tapper responds. ""The European Union, the Obama administration, the International Monetary Fund, pro-clean government activists in Ukraine, (all) thought that the prosecutor was not prosecuting corruption.""

""So you're saying Joe Biden didn't tell Ukraine to fire that prosecutor? I think he did,"" the congressman says.

""He did, but the guy was not prosecuting anything. That was the problem,"" Tapper replies.

""Here are the facts,"" Jordan says, before Tapper interjects, saying: ""You're not saying facts, you say, 'Here are the facts,' these are not.""

""Did Joe Biden tell him to fire the prosecutor?"" Jordan asks again.

""Because he wasn't going after corruption. He wasn't going after corruption. Do you understand what I'm saying?"" Tapper replies.

According to CNN's fact check , the Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, among others, had all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general in 2015.

Shokin was widely faulted for declining to bring prosecutions of elites' corruption, and he was even accused of hindering corruption investigations. His deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned in February 2016, alleging that Shokin's office was itself corrupt.

""Was that prosecutor looking into Burisma, the company that had hired Joe Biden's son for $50,000 a month?"" Jordan says.

""According to the Ukrainians, that investigation was dormant at the time,"" Tapper said, adding later: ""If you want to push a law saying that the children of presidents and vice presidents should not be doing international business deals, I'm all for it. But you're setting a standard that is not being met right now.""

Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. According to CNN's fact check, there is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

On Jordan's claims about the whistleblower

During his interview with Jordan, Tapper also fact-checked the congressman on his statements about the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump's communications with Zelensky revealed this week that the White House took extraordinary steps to conceal the call.

""Two things you look at to determine the credibility of a so-called whistleblower when they're coming forward,"" Jordan says. ""First, did they have firsthand knowledge? And second, what is their motivation? Was there some kind of bias? This individual has problems on both of those counts. He had no firsthand knowledge, he heard something from someone who may have heard something from someone.""

""No, no, his sources were firsthand sources,"" Tapper replies.

""But he has no firsthand knowledge. And second, he has a political bias. That should tell us something about this guy who came forward with this claim,"" Jordan says.

""You know as well as I do, that you do not need to have firsthand knowledge to be a whistleblower,"" replies Tapper.

""Well, you don't now because they changed the form. You used to,"" Jordan contends.

""There's no evidence of that. And we looked into this,"" Tapper says. ""It has never been true that you need to have firsthand knowledge to be a whistleblower.""

""But it's something that's critical when you're assessing if they're credible. That's a major determination,"" Jordan replies.

CNN reported earlier this month that the whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications that partly prompted the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general, according to an official briefed on the matter. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

The whistleblower's attorney, Andrew Bakaj, had no comment when asked about the claim that the individual did not have direct knowledge of the communication in question."

In a word from ancient Greece: hubris.

described it another way: ""Trump's decision to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political opponent one day after the country heard special counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress suggests a man with a political death wish .""

One thing worked well for candidate Donald Trump in 2016. His ability to nickname and define his political rivals swiftly and mercilessly froze everyone else out of the Republican nomination and then helped secure him an Electoral College victory over Hillary Clinton. So, according to documents released this past week, he decided to do it again -- by tarring 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden as dishonest and mired in a Ukraine corruption investigation -- despite the lack of evidence that the former vice president had done anything wrong.

But is this election fundamentally different from 2016, with Trump as President seeking re-election rather than as an unlikely candidate?

Josh Campbell said we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" Trump famously punches back at critics. And former FBI supervisory special agentsaid we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal , publicly blasting the whistleblower as a 'partisan,' even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The President denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been 'beautiful.' And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as 'the Ukraine witch hunt.'""

Now what?

As congressional committees investigate, people are looking ahead to the debate over whether Trump's actions are indeed impeachable.

Frank Bowman III is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: ""If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is.""

Forty-five years ago, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned within two weeks. Bowman wrote, ""Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept 'plumbers' looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.""

Paul Callan: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival.

The 'stick' or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.""

At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was 'normal' and 'nobody pushed me.' Career public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department also reviewed the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call and found there was no campaign finance crime to pursue.""

Julian Zelizer. ""There is a compelling argument that Many have written about the pressure a vote for impeachment would place on moderate Democrats elected in districts where Trump won in 2016.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President after a transcript of a July call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed he pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden -- his potential 2020 political rival -- and his son, Hunter. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

A separate whistleblower complaint also alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper.

Among Democrats, nearly 9 in 10 approve of the inquiry and two-thirds strongly approve -- 87% of Democrats approve of the inquiry, according to the poll. Meanwhile, 77% of Republicans disapprove and 23% approve starting an impeachment inquiry. Among Independents, 49% approve and 51% disapprove, the poll found.

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint is certainly worthy of investigation, but is an inappropriate phone call an impeachable offense? Is there evidence of a quid pro quo? Is there a case to be made that President Trump engaged in a ""betrayal of his oath of office""? Or is this a rush to judgment at a time we need to slow down and look at the facts?

Alice Stewart

It's not a heavy lift to find Republicans who have, at some point, looked at President Trump's actions and said, ""I would not have done that"" or ""I would not have said it that way."" I count myself among them. With that as a starting point, it's important to consider the credibility of the whistleblower complaint, the calculation of the Democrats and the collateral damage that will likely result from the impeachment proceedings.

Credibility of complaint:

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday that the whistleblower did the right thing and the complaint was ""credible"" and ""important.""

That's true, from the standpoint that the complaint follows the appropriate protocol and reporting procedures. The official complaint is a clearly calculated document, more likely prepared by an attorney than the work of a rank-and-file member of the intelligence community.

The California Democrat added that his committee is currently ""taking all the precautions we can to make sure that we do so -- we allow that testimony to go forward in a way that protects the whistleblower's identity, because as you can imagine, when the President is showing threats like, 'We ought to treat these people who expose my wrongdoing as we used to treat traitors and spies,' and we used to execute traitors and spies.

Things started benignly enough. On Friday night, September 20, the President's personal attorney attended a black-tie state dinner at the White House , smiling for cameras alongside his girlfriend Maria Ryan. Yet a week later, Giuliani was under siege, and at the heart of events that have led to the first formal impeachment inquiry into a president in 20 years.

In between, Giuliani conducted a one-man messaging war, going on Fox News at least four times, talking to numerous reporters, and sending more than 50 tweets, many of which were about Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their alleged dealings in Ukraine.

It was a surreal climax for Giuliani's 10-month, quixotic mission aimed at proving his theory that the origins of the investigation into Russian election interference can be traced back to Democrats' dealings in Ukraine. Along the way he went to Warsaw, Madrid, and very nearly Ukraine. He met with foreign nationals, coordinated with US State Department officials, dropped vague, confusing accusations in cable-TV appearances, and ceaselessly pitched US journalists on what he claims is one of the biggest scandals in modern American history— all while whispering in Donald Trump's ear about how Ukraine contained the keys to revealing truths about the President's political rivals.

The loose, slipshod strategy was designed to push a counternarrative about the true origins of the Russian investigation. ( Stirring up trouble for Biden was an added benefit.) Instead, in a dizzying reversal, Giuliani's actions boomeranged back on the President this week with stunning speed. By Friday, not only were Trump and Giuliani's Ukraine dealings the focus of the impeachment inquiry , but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been subpoenaed and the top US diplomat to Ukraine had resigned

Giuliani himself now faces the prospect of being in the crosshairs of the House's impeachment investigation.

Speaking Friday with CNN's Jim Sciutto, Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, did not rule out calling on Giuliani to testify or even subpoenaing him. ""I obviously have several questions for him,"" Quigley said.

Giuliani said he would not testify without consulting his client, Trump, and that testimony about his work for the President should be protected by attorney-client privilege.

""Ultimately, if I were to say yes and he were to say no, I can't testify,"" Giuliani told CNN Friday . Not long after, news broke that he had told Sky News essentially the opposite that he would in fact testify.

Asked if he was concerned he would be subpoenaed by the House, Giuliani laughed.

""I consider them a joke. A sad joke. They have no legitimacy. I would think of challenging their subpoena on the grounds that they're not a legitimate committee,"" Giuliani said.

Through it all, Giuliani has put up a defiant front. ""What they should be doing is giving me an award for uncovering something that when it's looked back on, someone's going to say, 'Why were you all asleep?'"" he told CNN Thursday.

Rudy goes rogue

Rudy Giuliani finds himself at the heart of the events that led to President Trump's impeachment battle

Giuliani's role in Ukraine can be traced back to November 2018, when he was contacted by someone he describes as a ""well-known investigator"" who connected him with a Ukrainian-American businessman in Florida named Lev Parnas.

Through Parnas, who did not respond to CNN's request for comment, Giuliani began speaking with multiple Ukrainian nationals about information about two subjects of interest to his client, President Trump.

The first regarded what Giuliani has described as collusion between Democrats and Ukraine during the 2016 election. The second is the claim that Vice President Biden had pressured Ukraine to halt an investigation connected to his own son.

One of the people Giuliani says he spoke with in December 2018, over Skype, was Viktor Shokin, Ukraine's former prosecutor general. In 2016, Biden was among multiple Western leaders who successfully urged Ukraine to dismiss Shokin from the country's top prosecutor position, citing his insufficient work to root out corruption.

Viktor Shokin in 2015

But Shokin told Giuliani a different story: that he was pushed out to stop an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company that included Hunter Biden as a compensated board member.

That story is littered with holes, and neither Giuliani nor anyone else has provided any evidence of actual wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president.""

There is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever under investigation.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the Ukrainian government's case against Burisma had been ""dormant"" since 2014, two years before Shokin was dismissed at Biden's urging. Furthermore, Biden was also joined in his anti-corruption push against the prosecutor by numerous leaders in Europe as well as the International Monetary Fund -- none of whom had any family ties to Burisma.

Giuliani kept pursuing both stories, the Biden allegations and the so-called collusion in the 2016 election. Giuliani says he twice met with Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko -- in New York in January 2019, then in Warsaw in February. Giuliani told CNN he learned more about both cases from Lutsenko, and that he also heard about Lutsenko's dissatisfaction with the US ambassador's supposed request that he drop certain prosecutions. In an April interview with the Babel, a Ukrainian news outlet, Lutsenko confirmed this account of their conversations.

Yuriy Lutsenko speaks during a briefing at the Central Election Commission in Kiev, Ukraine earlier this year.

According to the whistleblower's complaint, Giuliani's interactions with Ukrainian officials prompted concern among US officials about the ""circumvention of national security decision-making processes.""

Indeed, Giuliani's actions alarmed a number of career State Department officials , prompting some of them to keep distance between their work and his, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Specifically, they worried that being involved with his efforts would mean they were acting with a partisan political agenda, which as career foreign service officers they were not permitted to do.

Giuliani told CNN this week he never heard about any of those concerns. ""If they were going to get upset about this, they should have gotten upset about it in January or February,"" he said.

But there were limits to Giuliani's freelance diplomacy, and it turns out Lutsenko was hardly a reliable source of information. That's partly due to the fact that Lutsenko's hold on power was precarious following Ukraine's April presidential election. Lutsenko may also have had ulterior motives for pushing the Biden conspiracy with Giuliani. The transition between presidents in Ukraine meant that his job as prosecutor general was in jeopardy, and having a line to a close adviser to the US President was a good way to stay relevant.

Indeed, Lutsenko would end up backing off some of his claims that Giuliani worked to amplify, including that his office was reopening its investigation into Burisma and Biden. Lutsenko would leave his position as prosecutor general on August 29.

The administration gets involved

The public first got wind of Giuliani's Ukraine actions in May, when press reports, including one in the New York Times, described how Giuliani was promoting allegations about Biden and Burisma.

At the time, Giuliani told reporters, including CNN, that he was planning to travel to Ukraine to gather more information. Within a day of reports of his trip however, Giuliani canceled, telling CNN he was concerned that President-elect Zelensky had advisers around him who were ""very vocal opponents of President Trump and peculiarly vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton"" and that his trip would have accomplished little.

From there, the story faded from public view, but Giuliani kept working behind the scenes. A crucial development came on July 19, when Giuliani says the State Department's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, offered to place him in touch with one of Zelensky's top advisers, Andriy Yermak.

At about the same time, Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine. Trump has denied his decision to delay the aid had anything to do with his desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden.

Over the next two weeks, Giuliani told CNN he spoke with Yermak at least two times on the phone. He also said he reported back to Volker and the State Department on his conversations with Yermak.

According to the whistleblower complaint, ""multiple officials"" told the whistleblower that Ukrainian officials were ""led to believe that a meeting or phone call between"" Trump and Zelensky would depend on Zelensky's willingness to ""play ball"" on the cases raised by Giuliani.

Several days after the July 25 call, Giuliani told CNN he met with Yermak in person in Madrid on August 1.

After their meeting, Giuliani told CNN that he called Volker to relay the message he'd gotten from Yermak— that Zelensky was ridding himself of ""leftovers and bad actors.""

""I relayed back to him that I thought the guy was straight,"" Giuliani told CNN.

The whistleblower's complaint claims US officials characterized the August Madrid meeting as a ""direct follow-up"" to Trump's call with Zelensky.

Giuliani told CNN he was not aware that his August 1 meeting with Yermak was intended to follow up on Trump's call with Zelensky. Giuliani claimed he was unaware that Zelensky and Trump had brought his name up. He also said he never spoke with Trump about his meetings with Yermak. Giuliani claimed to CNN that he was not aware that he had been brought up in the July 25 phone call.

A wild week

By Tuesday night, Giuliani was texting and calling with CNN, mocking House speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement about the impeachment inquiry. Minutes later, he was on Fox News , echoing his claim to CNN that he had a phone full of text messages proving that he was acting at the behest of US officials.

""I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it,"" he told Laura Ingraham Tuesday.

The next morning, the White House released the transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, and Giuliani was relatively quiet and unresponsive to text messages from CNN.

But on Thursday, however, things ramped up again. The whistleblower complaint was released and the acting Director of National Intelligence was at a hearing in front the House Intelligence Committee. And it put Giuliani in full-attack mode.

Included in the complaint was the whistleblower's claim that two State Department officials had spoken to Giuliani to ""contain the damage"" he was doing to US national security interests regarding his work with Ukraine -- something Giuliani strongly disputed.

""At no time did either one of them say they wanted to contain damage,"" Giuliani told CNN . ""At no time did the State Department in communication with me ever relay any of that information you're talking about.""

Again, Giuliani went out of his way on the phone to CNN to point out that he had been in touch with Volker, telling CNN he had a ""nice little trail"" of text message conversations with Volker that would prove the State Department was fully aware of his actions regarding Ukraine.

But by now, the damage was done. Giuliani's involvement was enough not only to help prompt the House's impeachment inquiry but to raise the possibility he could be a witness.

Kurt Volker, United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, resigned on Friday

Events began to move very quickly by Friday afternoon. News first broke that House Democrats had subpoenaed Pompeo. A few hours later, Volker resigned from his post as the top diplomat to Ukraine. Giuliani's defense of himself -- that his Ukraine work had the blessing of the State Department -- was already causing heads to roll.

The 75-year-old former mayor, speaking with CNN Friday, was practically sanguine about this last development.

""He seemed like a very knowledgeable guy to me,"" said Giuliani, when asked about Volker's departure. ""And a decent guy."""

Waters’ “shout out” follows a week of impeachment drama in Congress, resulting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) caving and formally announcing an impeachment inquiry. Democrats used a “whistleblower” complaint – which is based entirely on hearsay, not firsthand knowledge – as a catalyst for their latest impeachment efforts.

Waters insisted on CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time on Thursday that Democrats have more than enough evidence to impeach President Trump, despite the transcript of the conversation between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky showing no quid pro quo:

She doubled down on Friday, proclaiming during an interview with BuzzFeed’s AM2DM that Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General William Barr are part of a “conspiracy”:

Let me just say that Attorney General Barr has defined himself as being just the president’s lawyer, not the people’s lawyer that he’s supposed to be. [He’s] willing to do whatever it takes to protect the president. He’s not a credible human being. His name has come up in this whole issue about the president’s call and work that’s been done with Ukraine to try to pressure them and get information about Biden. I know, given what he’s done in the past, that he’s guilty in being involved by either assisting Giuliani or doing other kinds of things to try and get Ukraine’s president to come out and get dirt on Biden. … First of all, we have seen that no matter what the president does, they come up with a kind of messaging to defend him. No matter what it is, none of them have had the courage, the patriotism, or the guts to stand up for what is right for our country. So I expect that Pence is part of this conspiracy to try to get Ukraine to do something in a fake investigation and come out with some dirt on Biden. I’m looking forward to that coming out in the hearings that will be done by the Judiciary Committee as they take up the impeachment resolution.

Waters also revealed herself to be a “transcript truther,” writing, “Trump & his sycophants tried to cover up the transcripts re: his phone call to Ukraine’s president by hiding the info on a server reserved for highly classified info. It didn’t work.”

The White House on Wednesday released the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump related to the matter. The call summary showed that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate a potential 2020 political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The rough transcript led Democrats to accuse Trump of a quid pro quo, after media reports on Monday revealed Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine days ahead of his call with Zelensky.

Top Democrats concluded the call summary showed clear evidence of Trump pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage.

Trump denied any wrongdoing and argued that the call summary showed there was no direct quid pro quo — an argument that was echoed by his Republican allies in Congress.

""You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo,"" Trump said in a press conference Wednesday in New York after the rough transcript's release.

On Wednesday, McConnell had dismissed criticism as ""laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense,"" Politico reported.

""I've read the summary of the call. If this is the 'launching point' for House Democrats' impeachment process, they've already overplayed their hand,"" McConnell said in a statement provided to Politico. ""It's clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for.""

Whistleblower complaint

The July phone call was part of a whistleblower complaint that alleged Trump solicited interference from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election.

After reports of the whistleblower complaint emerged, Trump acknowledged that Biden was mentioned on the call with Zelensky and later revealed that he had withheld military aid from Ukraine.

He claimed the delay in aid was not related to the investigation request, but because he was waiting on European allies to pay their fair share.

McConnell on Tuesday said he was "" never given an explanation "" why the aid to Ukraine was held up even as he was pressing administration officials to release the aid at the time.

Before the July call summary's release, the President had suggested last Sunday that he was open to releasing the call transcript, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out.""

Some of Trump's top administration officials argued otherwise, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who said ""there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC News . ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances.""

But two days later, Trump pledged to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine.""

The whistleblower complaint, which was made public Thursday after demands from Democrats, alleged that White House officials tried to ""lock down"" all records of Trump's Ukraine phone call -- especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.

White House lawyers directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information, the whistleblower alleged.

The whistleblower said they heard from other White House officials that this was ""not the first time"" that the Trump administration used this storage system to hold politically sensitive documents. The codeword-level system is meant to hold files of national security importance.

The White House acknowledged Friday that the move to place the Ukraine call transcript in the system came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys."

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

Cory Booker on Sunday announced he has reached the required donor threshold to qualify for the fifth Democratic presidential debate despite his campaign running behind on a self-imposed donation fundraising goal of $1.7 million.

The New Jersey senator's announcement comes after the Democratic National Committee announced last week that candidates must meet higher donor thresholds in order to qualify for the November debates. Candidates must raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories, up from the current minimum of 130,000 donors.

""We have nearly 35,000 donors who have been helping us make this goal. We've raised $1.5 million plus,"" Booker told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We've actually already crossed the threshold to make the November debates of 165,000 unique donors. The surge and the momentum is great, but yeah, I still need help.""

Booker has already qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate , which will be moderated by CNN and The New York Times, but he has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November stage. The DNC has not yet announced the date for that debate.

Now here's the thing that's truly mind-boggling. This week, that brief, damning summary describes the political reality of two of the world's leading nations, both the United Kingdom and the United States. As an American born and raised in Washington DC and a historian of modern Britain now rearing a blended US-UK family in both countries, I can only marvel and strive to make sense of what's happening as both countries seem to sink ever deeper into a political abyss of their own making.

The conclusions are hardly encouraging. While both prime minister Boris Johnson and President Donald Trump were elected under the banner of one of their country's major political parties, both stake their claim to legitimacy not on their having won out in the traditional game of party politics, but on their ability to cut through ""politics as usual"" and act on behalf of the popular will.

In the US, this populism manifests itself most clearly in Trump's promise to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, or side-step the party hacks, including those members of his own party, who see their only job as maintaining the status quo.

To review: In Britain, the high court declared on Wednesday that Johnson's actions advising the queen to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament for five weeks in the run up to the October 31 Brexit deadline was unlawful, as there appeared to be no justification for the suspension. Their ruling compelled Johnson to leave the UN climate change summit in New York and fly back to London where he met MPs with defiance, declaring the court's decision wrong and reiterating his determination to ""get Brexit done.""

The reason they made their announcement and explained their reasoning as a group, in an op-ed in The Washington Post , is because they had already formed a bond over their national security background -- especially the five women: Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, both ex-CIA officers; Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania who was in the Air Force; Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia were Naval officers.

They met on the 2018 campaign trail as first time candidates who kept bumping into each other at events with mutual donors and supporters.

When they got to talking, these five would-be congresswomen realized that they had a lot in common, despite being from different parts of the country: they all had careers in national security they were trying to parlay into elected office.

They became fast friends, and called themselves the ""badasses.""

""I think badasses kind of came organically from the group since we all had either served in the military or in the CIA,"" Houlahan said.

They are now a band of sisters who bonded while storming the unfamiliar terrain of politics.

""Being able to text folks and say, 'you know, I'm really getting hit up on this issue, how have you been handling it?' 'I'm not sure how to translate my service into something that's relatable. How do you guys do that?'"" Slotkin said she frequently asked the others.

""We have a lot in common,"" said Spanberger. ""We all were working to flip seats to be elected in places where voters may not typically vote for people like us or with our backgrounds.""

Making their mark in an unlikely way: impeachment

When we first talked in mid-September, none of the five congresswomen women supported an impeachment inquiry. Then, after hearing Trump admit that he spoke to Ukraine's leader about Joe Biden , a potential 2020 political rival, they changed their minds. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Trump himself has denied any wrongdoing.

""Having the sitting President of the United States, use leverage over a foreign leader to get dirt on an opponent,"" Slotkin said. ""That very basic idea, I think cut for us, as national security people, just close to the bone.""

The op-ed the women penned, along with Gil Cisneros and Jason Crow, two freshmen male veterans, opened the floodgates for others who had been resistant, and gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi critical political cover as she announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.

They say it was all for one, and one for all.

""A great example of the power of teamwork,"" Houlahan said.

""I think we all sort of came to that conclusion together,"" Sherrill said. ""We text each other as you know, and I think we were all going, okay, I think this has all changed. This is a bright line.""

Still, it was a big leap for people still trying to find their sea legs in politics.

""I'm supervising the operation nuclear reactor,"" Luria recalls of her time before being in office. ""I never turned the reactor operator and said, are you a Democrat or Republican?""

""It was new to jump into such a partisan environment,"" she added.

From left to right, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, Rep. Mikie Sherill of New Jersey, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Top GOP targets

Backing an impeachment inquiry is risky political business for these congresswomen -- some of the biggest political targets in the House. They are Democrats who won mostly in Trump territory by campaigning on kitchen table issues like health care and affordable prescription drugs.

Their GOP opponents are already attacking them hard for backing an impeachment inquiry of a president who won in 2016 with considerable support in most of their districts.

""I believe that if I am out there explaining what these allegations are to the people of my district and to the people of other districts, and why they are so deeply concerned that the people will understand why we had to take a stand,"" said Spanberger, the first Democrat to represent her Virginia district since in almost 50 years, and where President Trump won by 7 percentage points.

They are under no illusion that this is going to be politically easy for them.

""All of us in our prior lives all the time had to make hard calls for the reasons we thought were right when we knew that not everyone would understand or even know,"" declared Slotkin, who also represents a district where Trump won by 7 percentage points. "" And that to me is something I feel comfortable doing because I've always had to do it.""

Change

CNN sat down with these self-described ""badasses"" in the House Armed Services Committee room on Capitol Hill, surrounded by portraits of all the men -- only men -- who have chaired the committee on which four of them now sit.

Houlahan noted that many of them, as well as rank-and-file members of this committee, historically did not always have previous military service on their resumes.

Luria and Sherrill -- both Navy veterans -- quickly agreed.

""You were on ships,"" said Houlahan, pointing to Luria. ""I was an engineer.""

""We were all, you know, kind of experiencing our service in different ways,"" Houlahan said. ""And I think we're able to fold that in together on legislative ideas and our agendas.""

""I did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military"" added Slotkin a former CIA officer, ""carrying a weapon and wearing my body armor. And I think there's something about having done prior service that connects you to the consequences of the decisions that are being made here and at the White House.""

Not 'the squad'

Until now, the House freshmen group that got the most headlines is the so-called ""squad,"" who come from reliably Democratic areas far different from the swing districts these ""Badasses"" represent.

They have different political realities, and very different styles.

""None of us is ever going to get in a Twitter war with anyone else,"" Slotkin said flatly. ""If we have a concern with someone, we're going to go right up and talk to them about it and we're not going to add unhelpful rhetoric to an already bad tone coming out of Washington.""

Have they been frustrated that ""the squad"" and Twitter wars they're involved in get attention?

""I don't care who has the headlines,"" Spanberger responded. ""I care about the legislation that we prioritize and I don't think any of us want to be the loudest voice in the room. I just want to be one of the most effective.""

They also realize that despite needing GOP votes to win these moderate districts, they also need to keep their left flank happy, and excited.

""What I tell people in my district, the left wing of our party has created such momentum behind things like moving forward on our environment,"" Sherrill said.

From left to right, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Rep. Mikie Sherill of New Jersey, Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Bonding over job as well as family

They picked offices near one another, which they say makes it easier to work together -- in rarer moments than they anticipated -- decompress with a glass of wine of a bottle of beer.

They bond not just over their jobs, but their families. They all have children -- some, very young.

Spanberger has three daughters ages five, eight and eleven, and says her middle daughter wants to be Houlahan for Halloween.

""It's gonna be hard to pull off,"" Houlahan said, laughing.

Sherrill is a mother of four young children.

""Somebody said to me the other day, they said, 'well, you're just real down to earth. You're not, you know, you're pretty humble.' And I said, yeah, I have a 14-year-old daughter, It's really hard not to be humble,"" joked Sherrill.

Slotkin said that when she started running for Congress she was struck by how unusual it seemed for people that her husband was by her side as an active participant in her campaign.

""A lot of people would say, you guys are so modern ... I said, what? What does that mean?"" she recalled.

""I realized after a few people said it, that they were used to either a man running for office and the wife is way in the background, you know, quiet, not a part of the campaign,"" Slotkin said. ""Or there is a strong woman who's running, we've had strong women who have run and won, but their husband is nowhere to be seen. So when they saw a strong woman and a strong man together, that was new for them.""

Breaking the chain of command

The ""badasses"" say that several more senior women in Congress have told them how much they marveled at how fearless they are in meetings and in hearings, considering how new they are to politics, never mind Congress.

""There's not a vertical chain of command structure,"" said Luria, noting the difference between Congress and the Navy where she served for 20 years.

When reminded that it may be less formal in Congress, but there historically is a wait-your-turn and know-your-place Capitol Hill dynamic, they collectively shrugged that off.

""None of us, none of us came to Congress from a district that wants us to just sit here and be quiet and learn the ropes and figure it out,"" Sherrill said. ""They want us to engage and they want change and they want it now.""

They are certainly getting it."

It was a strategic mistake, because the evidence contradicted her claims. But it was also a terrible mistake for the country, because it cast the fairness of the 2020 presidential election into serious doubt.

Trump supporters will rally to support him at the polls — a lesson Democrats should have learned when Republicans lost the 1998 midterm elections in the midst of impeaching President Bill Clinton (who, unlike Trump, had actually committed crimes). Moreover, public support for the inquiry will collapse once the facts are known — through the media fog that is giving the misleading “whistleblower” complaint more credibility than the underlying evidence.

But Democrats hope that impeaching Trump — or even suggesting impeachment — will place a permanent cloud over his head that will make it impossible for him to win in 2020.

If they are right, Trump supporters will look at impeachment as the reason for his defeat. And the fact that Democrats have relied on a CIA source who had no direct evidence of wrongdoing in an attempt to bring down President Trump will be seared into Trump supporters’ collective memory.

The message Democrats are sending is that not only do they refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election as legitimate, but they are willing to use the intelligence community to reverse the results of that election.

In January 2017, before President-elect Trump took office, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) warned: “Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.” The CIA, and the Democrats, are delivering on that threat.

Of course, Trump had every reason to be suspicious of the intelligence community: they had spied on his campaign and his transition team, and leaked information to the media to undermine him. Outgoing Obama administration officials were hurriedly unmasking U.S. citizens caught on wiretaps, at least one of which was illegally leaked to the media. Then-FBI Director James Comey brought Trump the phony “dossier” — not to warn him, but to intimidate him, and to gather more information from the way the President-elect would react.

Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) defended the Obama administration’s spying by arguing we had to know if a presidential candidate was “compromised” by a foreign government. (Note the double standard with Biden.)

And the surveillance continued. In the early days of the administration, Trump’s telephone calls with foreign leaders — including close allies, like Australia’s prime minister — were leaked from someone in the intelligence loop. That is the likeliest reason for the White House placing the Ukraine call on a more secure system. The White House knew that the intelligence community had abused its power before and might do so again. (That suspicion was, of course, soon confirmed.)

The Democrats, the media, and rogue CIA agents are making it impossible for Trump to do his job. No foreign leader will talk to our president if he or she knows the conversation will be leaked. That is the real threat to national security, not the contents of Trump’s chitchat with Zelensky.

It is also a threat to our democracy. If Democrats succeed, many Trump supporters will lose faith in the whole system, with dangerous consequences.

That is the Pandora’s box Pelosi has opened. Only a Trump victory can close it.

Michael D'Antonio

In politics, as in Hollywood, those who'd rather pick a fight than compromise -- or, in Donald Trump's case, act with basic decency -- create the conditions for their own downfall. After Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry, there were early signs of the President's weakness. While the knockout punch has not been delivered, Republicans who were previously staunch allies began to waver.

On Friday, former Sen. Jeff Flake told NPR that at least 35 GOP Senators would support impeaching Trump if they were allowed to vote in secret. ""Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons realizes that there's not a lot of love for the President. There's a lot of fear of what it means to go against the President, but most Republican senators would not like to be dealing with this for another year or another five years,"" he said. Added to Democratic votes, Flake's estimate of 35 Republicans would make for the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office.

As Flake suggests, Republican officials may fear Trump but they do not like him. Consider the President's penchant for insults and demeaning nicknames and it's easy to agree with Flake's logic. Remember that then-candidate Trump mocked and disparaged Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz as ""Little Marco"" and ""Lyin' Ted"" and you'll understand why they might have little sympathy for him now.

Trump's vulnerability was in clear view when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell allowed the upper chamber to vote on a resolution urging the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress. The resolution passed unanimously in the GOP-controlled Senate."

(CNN) The twists, turns and characters outlined in the complaint filed by an unnamed whistleblower to the intelligence community's inspector general read like a pilot for a new television series. This however is real life and, with impeachment investigations beginning, understanding the key elements of the complaint will be critical in following the events that unfold.

While the White House continues to deny any wrongdoing, the scope of activity presented in the complaint raises many alarming issues. Here are the five main plot points to watch for as Congress takes steps to follow up on these blockbuster allegations.

1) The complaint has been corroborated

A common talking point among many supporters of President Donald Trump is that the complaint is based on second-hand information , or hearsay. And, yes, the whistleblower does note not being ""a direct witness to most of the events described."" But this point would have been taken into consideration when the ICIG reviewed whether the complaint was ""credible,"" as he was required to do under the whistleblower statute . Notably, the ICIG still concluded that the report was ""credible.""

This judgment could be questioned if it weren't for two important things. First, the day before the release of the whistleblower's complaint, the White House released a memo containing a real-time transcription of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This call is the same one referenced in Part I of the complaint. Even based on secondhand knowledge, the whistleblower's account of the call was identical in key details to what actually took place: That the President requested Ukraine to 1) investigate the activities of Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; 2) assist in efforts to link 2016 election interference with Ukraine; and 3) work with Attorney General Bill Barr and Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.

More importantly, the complaint indicates that it is based on accounts from at least six White House officials who did have consistent, first-hand knowledge of the call and other events described in the complaint. This means that there are at least a half dozen witnesses whom Congress can call to corroborate the allegations made in the complaint.

2) There appears to have been a coverup

No scandal is truly complete without a coverup, and this one appears to have it. Part II of the whistleblower's complaint alleges that the officials who witnessed the call first hand were directed by White House lawyers to move the verbatim transcript from where it would normally be stored to a separate system which is used for highly classified information and to which access is highly restricted. (This part of the complaint has been confirmed by the White House.) Because the President's call with Ukraine did not relate to a ""codeword"" operation (typically used for covert actions), it would ordinarily not meet the standards to be stored on the restricted server. The classification markings on the released transcript supports this, as it is marked at the Secret classification level, a relatively low level of classification (while not the lowest).

Importantly, the complaint indicates that officials who received the orders believed that the transcript was moved in order to conceal evidence that might be politically embarrassing to the President and the White House -- and the appendix to the complaint alleges that the systems had been misused on other occasions for the same purpose.

In addition to an attempt to conceal a possible crime or abuse of power by the President, this on its own could be a violation of an Executive Order , which prohibits ""overclassifying"" information in order to ""prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency."" Congress will undoubtedly seek to find out who gave orders to try to conceal these transcripts from further distribution and possibly seek to obtain other ""hidden"" transcripts with world leaders.

3) The State Department may have facilitated Trump's activities

The complaint indicates that at least one State Department official, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, listened in on the call between Trump and Zelensky (though the State Department has denied this to be true). In addition, Part III of the complaint states that US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker (who has since resigned), along with US Ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials on the day following Trump's call. The whistleblower received multiple readouts of these meetings, which indicated that these State Department officials advised Ukrainian officials on how to ""navigate"" the requests that Trump made to Zelensky on the phone.

If true, this would mean that officials from the State Department were not only aware of Trump (ab)using the power of his office to extract personal favors from a foreign nation, but were engaged in efforts to help bring them to fruition. The process of organizing these official meetings, as well as the readouts of what took place in them, would leave an extensive paper trail.

Three committees of Congress have already subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce all documents related to meetings with Ukraine, and Pompeo himself will likely be called to testify about them. If he complies, the public will learn more about what expectations were conveyed to Zelensky regarding his compliance with Trump's wishes. If he doesn't comply, the House can use his defiance as evidence of obstruction, which could form its own basis for an article of impeachment.

4) The Department of Justice may have ignored a clear conflict of interest

The whistleblower complaint contains only a few references to Barr -- that he was ""involved"" in Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, and that he was mentioned ""in tandem"" with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, several times (more on Giuliani, below). The primary source -- the White House memo -- substantiates this allegation, with Trump telling Zelensky to communicate with Barr on the investigations he requested. Notably, the Justice Department released a statement just after the White House transcript release went public, denying Barr made contact with the Ukrainians.

But Barr's role in this unfolding drama takes on significance after the complaint was filed. This is because once the ICIG determined that the complaint was credible, he passed the complaint on to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. At that point, Maguire was required by law to transmit the complaint, along with any additional comments he chose to provide, to Congress.

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Impeachment is nothing anyone should be cheering Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Impeachment is nothing anyone should be cheering 02:51

He didn't. Instead, Maguire took the complaint to the White House, ostensibly (based on his testimony to Congress) to inquire whether the contents were covered by executive privilege. Two things happened next. First, the White House obtained a legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, which determined that the subject matter of the complaint did not fall under the jurisdiction of the DNI, and therefore could not be brought under the whistleblower statute.

The OLC stated that the proper channel for the DNI was to present a criminal referral of the matter to the Justice Department. The DNI did so, and the Justice Department determined that the complaint required no further investigation, either as a possible violation of campaign finance laws (which prohibits soliciting any ""thing of value"" from a foreign state or person) or any other law.

Of course, Barr is ultimately in charge of both the OLC and the Criminal Division of the FBI. Since he himself is implicated in the allegations, he should have been required to recuse in any evaluation of the complaint by his agency.

Congress will likely seek to find out what role he played in either the OLC decision or the decision not to investigate, why Barr did not recuse and if he played any other role in the allegations laid out in the complaint. Congress may also choose to call the head of the OLC, Steven Engel, to explain his reasoning, and in particular why issues regarding handling of classified information would not fall under the jurisdiction of the DNI.

5) Rudy Giuliani, international man of mystery

Perhaps the most perplexing part of the whistleblower's complaint is the role of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney. According to the complaint, Giuliani reached out privately to several advisers to the Ukrainian President as, based on accounts of US officials, ""direct"" follow-up to Trump's requests in his July 25 phone call. Notably, these meetings are substantiated by public statements Giuliani made on TV and in news interviews. In addition, footnote 9 of the complaint states that Giuliani claimed to be working on gathering information to provide to the Justice Department as part of its official investigation into to ""origins"" of the Russia probe, which is currently being handled by Connecticut US Attorney John Durham, and who is also reportedly looking into Ukraine's role in the 2016 election interference. (It should be noted here that the intelligence community has unanimously concluded that Russia was behind said interference.)

Congress will no doubt want to hear directly from Giuliani about his role in all of these efforts. Giuliani has already indicated that he may invoke attorney-client privilege to refrain from testifying (because he is acting in a private, rather than official capacity, executive privilege would not apply). But this may be an uphill battle.

The crime-fraud exception states that the attorney-client privilege cannot be used as a shield for potentially illegal activity. The Supreme Court's decision in U.S. v. Nixon did not allow the President to use executive privilege to shield potentially illegal conduct in a criminal proceeding. This precedent would likely apply as strongly in the case of a private attorney-client privilege.

Even beyond that, the privilege only covers communications between Giuliani and Trump himself: Communications between Giuliani and officials either in the State Department or Justice Department would not be covered. Congress will want to find out: How closely was Giuliani working with US government officials who were aware that he was tasked with carrying out Trump's potentially illegal requests?

Given the sheer number of characters and plot lines emerging in the whistleblower saga, the American public may have a difficult time keeping up. But the only thing they have to remember is the most important question in any scandal: Who knew what, and when did they know it?

“Joe Biden is a predator; the media is covering it up,” a man waving a #MeToo sign interrupted Biden as he spoke at the East Las Vegas Community Center.

The disruption quickly drew “boos” from the vice president’s supporters, some who began to confront the heckler. Biden, himself, attempted to diffuse the tension by warning his supporters to leave the man alone.

“No, no, let him go, let him go,” the former vice president told those in attendance, as one supporter, in particular, began shouting and sticking his finger in the heckler’s face. The disruptor, though, appeared unfazed by the commotion, continuing to shout “#MeToo” and “he’s a predator.”

The incident was captured live on video by a number of news outlets on hand to cover the event.

Earlier this year, the former vice president was accused of inappropriate touching by Lucy Flores, the Democrat’s unsuccessful 2014 nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada. In a widely circulated op-ed, Flores alleged Biden inappropriately touched and kissed her during a campaign event. Following the revelations, several more women came forward to accuse Biden of unwanted touching.

Despite issuing a public apology and promising to be more “mindful” about respecting the personal space of others, Biden has repeatedly made light of the accusations on the campaign trail."

The younger Biden, who has a storied history of personal and professional issues, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the Bidens are denying any wrongdoing, even going to the extent of accusing Trump of abusing his power, the situation only underscores the shadowy nature of Hunter Biden’s professional life.

Breitbart News is providing an indepth breakdown of instances in which Hunter Biden’s business interests directly intersected with his father’s position in elective office.

1. Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor hired Hunter fresh out of law school.

Shortly after Joe Biden was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, his largest campaign contributor, the credit card issuer MBNA Corp., hired Hunter for an undisclosed role. The job raised eyebrows from ethics watchdogs since MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner designed to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations.

Clouding the picture even further was the fact that then 26-year-old Hunter Biden was a recent graduate of Yale Law School with no banking or business experience. Both father and son defended the job offer, claiming nothing improper had or would result because of the arrangement.

“Unfortunately, no matter where I went to work, some people would make an issue of it,” the younger Biden told the Delaware News Journal in November 1996 when the job was announced.

Despite his role being unknown at the time of his hiring, when Hunter Biden left the company in 1998 to join the Clinton-era Commerce Department it was as a senior vice president.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Joe Biden was championing bankruptcy reform legislation endorsed by financial interests and credit card companies such as MBNA.

2. Hunter Biden was on MBNA’s payroll while Joe Biden was writing bankruptcy reform legislation.

In the early-2000s, Hunter Biden remained on MBNA’s payroll as a consultant while his father was writing and pushing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The arrangement, which did not become public until after the law was passed, started in 2001 after Hunter Biden had left his position in the Commerce Department. Hunter Biden was paid monthly consulting fees, with some claiming they ranged upwards of $100,000, to advise the company on online banking issues.

The 2005 bankruptcy law tightened regulations to make it extremely difficult to declare bankruptcy. The law was heavily favored by MBNA and other giants in the banking and finance sectors. Many consumer protection advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have claimed the bill benefited special interests at the expense of consumers. Some have even suggested the law only served to hasten and aggravate the recession of the late 2000s.

As previously reported by the New York Times, Biden worked against many of his own fellow Democrats in Congress to ensure the final version of the bill was free of provisions opposed by companies such as MBNA.

Biden “was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month,” the Times noted.

3. Hunter Biden sought to monetize off his father’s political standing on Wall Street.

In 2006, shortly before Joe Biden assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and launched his second presidential campaign, Hunter purchased a hedge fund called Paradigm Global Advisors with his uncle, James. Although neither had a strong background in finance, James and Hunter believed they could leverage Joe Biden’s political connections to their benefit.

“Don’t worry about investors,” James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother, purportedly told Paradigm’s senior leadership upon taking over the fund, as reported by Politico. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”

Paradigm’s executives claim that James and Hunter Biden saw the hedge fund as a way to “take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money” to Joe Biden’s campaign account.

“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” James Biden allegedly told Paradigm’s staff.

As part of their effort to cash in on Joe Biden’s political influence, Hunter and James also tried to solicit labor unions to invest their pension funds with Paradigm. The duo’s main argument when pitching to unions was their access and ties to Joe Biden, who has a long record of advocating for collective bargaining.

The entire approach proved unsuccessful after a series of bad investments — including a partnership with a Ponzi scheme. James and Hunter eventually chose to strip the hedge fund of all its assets in 2010, selling them to the highest bidder before shuttering it indefinitely.

4. Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China only days after his father paid an official visit to the country.

As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden inked a multi-billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The deal, which was the first of its kind, created a private equity fund, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) to invest Chinese money overseas.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China. Schweizer said:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden is still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

5. The Obama-Biden administration helped facilitate the sale of U.S. company with insight into military technology to BHR and a Chinese state-owned defense firm.

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company.

The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.

When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”

Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.

“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley noted when launching the probe."

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

Host Jake Tapper asked, “Do you think it’s acceptable for the child of a president or vice president to be sitting on the board of a foreign company while their parent is conducting foreign policy?”

Booker said, “Look, I have a lot of beliefs about ethics rules and the needs for our government of the United States to go far further in the rules that we have. But the fact that the Republicans right now are trying to use this and distract from the president of the United States and his own actions is to me incredible. And so, yeah, I have problems with the way things happen. I have problems with congresspeople coming in and leaving their office and walking right out the door and going to work for lobbying firms. There are a lot of things I see in Washington that need changing, and I intend to bring a whole new suite of ethics laws to the White House when I get there.”

Tapper asked, “It sounds like your suggesting that in a Booker administration the child of a president or vice president, it would not be okay for them to be joining foreign boards while the president or vice president is conducting foreign policy as required by the law. Am I hearing you incorrectly or hearing you correctly?”

Booker added, “Look, I’m watching what’s going on with the Trump family right now, and Trump properties and I just find that deeply offensive to just any kind of independent sense of what’s honorable, ethical, not to mention inconsistent with the Emoluments Clause. I just don’t think children of presidents, vice presidents during the administration should be out there doing that.”

The interview got heated when co-Host Ed Henry asked if Trump did anything “illegal” during his call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Levin responded, “What crime was violated? It’s not illegal. The question is whether Biden did something illegal. The president didn’t do anything illegal. You know how I know? Because Nancy Pelosi’s been on every tv show and she can’t cite one section of the United States code where it’s illegal. My question is, why is Joe Biden above the law? Why is his son above the law? Where is Hunter Biden today? Where is the media? Don’t they want to know? Don’t they want to know if the leading contender for the Democrat nomination is a crook and if his son is a crook?”

Henry interjected, “That’s a quote from the transcript, sir.”

Levis said, “Let me finish. You have all morning. I have two minutes. It’s not an honest question. Show me in the transcript where the president said that … nowhere.”

He continued, “The media have taken sides here and what I’m saying is this is an utterly corrupt political, partisan process. And it’s about time we had some real reporters who would try to get to the bottom of this.”

He added, “There’s going to be a huge backlash in this country one way or the other. You can’t disenfranchise 63 million people who are on to this, who have alternative forms of information. Real cover-up here. Gee, we have the letter, and we have the transcripts, and all I get are reporters trying to tell me what the transcript says as opposed to what I read with my own eyes and telling me it’s the offense of the century that the president of the United States dares to mention something that’s in the American newspapers to the Ukrainian president.”

“He doesn’t say get Biden,” Levin continued. “He doesn’t say I’m digging up dirt on Biden. He doesn’t say do me a favor and get Biden. He says, ‘Why don’t you talk to my attorney general, look into this. People have questions.’ Wow. And all the sleazy activity that’s going behind the scenes. I want to know. I want to know if Adam Schiff and his staff, working with this phony whistleblower. I want to know who the lawyers are who helped him write that complaint as I was the first to point out before. I want to know the whole activity that’s taking place in the shadows of this government to try and bring down a president of the United States.”

“Things are being done to this president that have never been done to prior presidents,” he added. “Where did they keep the transcript of the phone call? Who gives a damn! The president has a power to issue an executive privilege order. Doesn’t matter if he kept it in his pillow. He can still protect that, but he didn’t. He gave it up.”

Partial transcript as follows:

BRENNAN: Big week here, but I want to begin where Nancy Pelosi just left off. She lays out what she says is most problematic the sequencing.

GRAHAM: Right.

BRENNAN: The president in this call record says–

GRAHAM: Right.

BRENNAN: –“Would you do us a favor?” He brings up debunked myth about the DNC server and then he brings up the Biden family and the need for an investigation. He repeatedly lays that out. And also the aid package is mentioned.

GRAHAM: Right.

BRENNAN: You have no problem with any of this?

GRAHAM: I have zero problems with this phone call–

BRENNAN: Even with that sequencing?

GRAHAM: I just told you I have zero problems with this phone call. There is no quid pro quo here but I do have a problem with Nancy Pelosi. If you believe that Donald Trump did something to hurt this country you owe it to vote not talk about impeaching the president. The only way to open up an impeachment inquiry is to vote. We need a John Hancock moment from House Democrats. Quit hiding behind Nancy Pelosi. If you think the president did something wrong in this phone call then vote to open up an article of impeachment inquiry and a lot of House Democrats won’t because they’re afraid.

BRENNAN: Well putting that political calculus aside I want to ask you about the content though–

GRAHAM: Yea.

BRENNAN: –of this conversation.

GRAHAM:Can I tell you about this conversation?

BRENNAN: Do you think it was ethical for–

GRAHAM: Yes.

BRENNAN: –the president to bring up Joe Biden?

GRAHAM: Yes, absolutely. I think somebody ought to look at whether or not Joe Biden had the prosecutor fired in an improper way. I love Joe Biden. I don’t want to look at it. I want an inspector general somebody like Mueller. Did Biden know that his son was receiving 50,000 dollars a month from a gas company being investigated by the prosecutor–

BRENNAN: Isn’t that just–

GRAHAM: –wait a minute–

BRENNAN: –his payment–

GRAHAM: –wait a minute–

BRENNAN: –for being on the board?

GRAHAM: The–

BRENNAN: Do you have reason to believe–

GRAHAM: The board- the guys–

BRENNAN: it was anything more than that?

GRAHAM: –on a board being investigated for corruption and the guy doing the investigation is asked to be fired by Biden. I don’t know what happened. It smells to high heaven. I never said the Mueller witch hunt- the Mueller investigation was a witch hunt. I introduced legislation to protect Mueller. This seems to me like a political setup. It’s all hearsay. You can’t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistle blower didn’t hear the phone call.

BRENNAN: Right.

GRAHAM: Who told the whistleblower–

BRENNAN: — Which he says.

GRAHAM: –about the phone call and everything else?

BRENNAN: He says–

GRAHAM: Donald Trump is–

BRENNAN: –multiple White House officials were discussing it.

GRAHAM: –still an American. Every American deserves to confront their accuser. So this is a sham as far as I’m concerned. I want to know who told the whistleblower about the phone call. I want to know why they changed the rules about whistleblowers not- the hearsay rule was changed just a short period of time before the complaint was filed. The complaint sounds like a legal document who help him- who helped this guy write it or this girl write it? We’re not going to try the president of the United States based on hearsay. Every American has a right to confront their accuser.

BRENNAN: You wanted the president to release this partial call record–

GRAHAM: I did.

BRENNAN: –but you’re saying this is hearsay.The complaint on a number of fronts–

GRAHAM: –who–

BRENNAN: –is matched by

GRAHAM: –the–

BRENNAN: –the call record–

GRAHAM: –the transcript and the complaint are not matched–

GRAHAM: –now- now wait a minute–

BRENNAN: –the reference to the DNC server–

GRAHAM: –please let me talk–

BRENNAN: –the will you do–

GRAHAM: –please, please–

BRENNAN: –a favor. I’m laying out the facts here.

GRAHAM: No- no you’re not.

BRENNAN: The repeated–

GRAHAM: No, you’re making an argument that–

BENNAN: –reference to Joe Biden–

GRAHAM: Here’s the point–

BRENNAN: All of those things–

GRAHAM: Joe Biden–

BRENNAN: –are laid out here–

GRAHAM: –went to the–

BRENNAN: –the face that the attorney general was brought up.

GRAHAM: Nevermind. You know you’ve got an opinion and I got an opinion. You’ve got me on the show to tell me what- what I think. I think Mueller did a good job for the country and there was nothing there. I think this whole thing is a sham. I can’t believe we’re talking about impeaching the president based on an accusation based on hearsay. Who is this whistleblower? What bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint. What’s going on here? Why did they change the rules about a whistleblower you can use hearsay when you could not just weeks before the complaint? So I think this thing stinks and let me tell you about Republican’s – you want to know about Republicans? Republicans believe that you’re guilty just by the accusation if you’re Brett Kavanaugh it doesn’t matter. They don’t tell you when it happened and where it happened it just happened 30 years ago. If you’re Donald Trump you don’t get to confront your accuser like every other American. Republicans believe this president is being persecuted. They don’t love Donald Trump and the way he does business. They like what he does, but they believe he’s being persecuted. They believe that everybody’s out to get him and I believe as to this complaint it smells.

BRENNAN: So the acting director of national intelligence who was put in that job by the Trump administration–

GRAHAM: Yeah.

BRENNAN: –said he believed that the whistleblower was–

GRAHAM: No, he did not–

BRENNAN: acting in good faith–

GRAHAM: No, he did not. He said they couldn’t question his motives–

BRENNAN: Right–

GRAHAM: But he didn’t know if it’s true or not. So Adam Schiff read the- the- the- the transcript in a way that everybody would believe that Trump’s guilty. The DNI did not say he- he could confirm this–

BRENNAN No.

GRAHAM: He didn’t know- he didn’t have any reason to believe the- the whistleblower’s doing anything wrong. What I want to know, who told the whistleblower about the transcript? Who told the whistleblower about a phone call between the president of the United States and a foreign leader–

BRENNAN: Yeah, he–

“The New York Bar Association needs to investigate Giuliani and probably disbar him,” the former attorney-general told Chris Matthews. She echoed the message in an interview with CNN, saying:

Rudy Giuliani really ought to stop talking and get a lawyer…I’m calling for the IG to investigate if any State officials worked with Giuliani to help him with his personal quest, but I am also saying…the state bar of New York needs to investigate Rudy Giuliani.

Harris’s statements come on the heels of Thursday’s controversial “whistleblower” release, which included a claim that State Department officials spoke to Giuliani “in an attempt to ‘contain the damage’ to U.S. national security” over his communications with Ukraine. Giuliani bluntly told CNN that he had “no knowledge of any of that crap.”

“At no time did either one of them say they wanted to contain damage,” Giuliani said. “At no time did the State Department in communication with me ever relay any of that information you’re talking about.”

President Trump continues to fight allegations of inappropriate interaction with Ukraine. In response, he personally authorized the release of the now-infamous call’s full transcript. Democrats — including the historically resistant Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — claim that the call forms a legitimate basis for an impeachment inquiry.

Meanwhile, despite his lamentation that Trump’s conduct is a “tragedy for this country,” former Vice President Joe Biden is facing some tough questions of his own. His son, Hunter Biden, was given a position on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas company, despite having no related experience.

This was during his father’s tenure as the Obama administration’s Ukraine “point man.” And while Biden claims never to have spoken with his son about the dealings, Hunter’s own account is directly contradictory."

However, Breitbart News reported Thursday that the transcript did not contain any mention of “quid pro quo” that might justify the Democrat’s efforts to impeach President Trump.

The report stated:

The much-discussed phone call did not include an exchange where Trump said he would only release temporarily frozen military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky agreed to investigate the unusual and highly lucrative relationship between a Ukrainian firm and Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, Trump highlighted how Congressional Democrats communicated with Ukraine officials in the past when they asked them to investigate the president.

“The Democrats, they went down to see the president of Ukraine and they asked him for all sorts of things,” he commented, adding that the Democrats had urged the Ukraine officials not to work with Republicans and to remain in step with their party.

“U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018, urging them to cooperate with investigators in the Russia investigation and the investigation of President Donald Trump,” the report concluded.

On Saturday, the president defended himself on Twitter by stating that Zelensky said he never felt any kind of pressure during their phone conversation in July.

As he signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Ben Franklin famously said, “If we don’t all hang together, we will all hang separately.” That is, if we patriots don’t stay close and stay strong, the British will divide us, conquer us—and hang each one of us.

In military terms, this is a core concept: Wise generals know to keep their force united, lest individual elements be attacked separately and defeated in detail.

We can add that the same point about the value of unity also applies to smaller battle situations, in which group psychology plays an important role. The anthropological term for the power of togetherness is synchrony; it explains why soldiers enjoy higher morale when they march in formation and why they fight better when they stay in a group.

This principle of unity applies, as well, to political combat—the more concentrated the mass, the better. And it applies particularly to Washington’s periodic media feeding-frenzies, such as the one we’re seeing today over the White House “whistleblower.”

So we come to a key takeaway involving, yes, the importance of political solidarity. It’s true that sometimes in difficult political situations it might seem that the safest course of action is “every man for himself,” and yet, far more often there’s more safety, as well as strength, to be found in unity—including the unity of staying on message.

1974 and 1998

We can look back to history to see how this dynamic—solidarity, or not—has played out:

During the Watergate investigation, 1972-74, many congressional Republicans split away from their fellow Republican, President Richard Nixon. In the course of that two-year ordeal, Washington was a feeding frenzy of leaky independent counsels, impeachment-bent Democrats, and thirsting-for-blood reporters; in the middle of this mess, many Republicans figured that they could save themselves by abandoning Nixon.

At the same time, many other Republicans chose to stick with Nixon. Why? Some GOPers simply believed that the 37th president hadn’t done anything wrong, although probably more thought that whatever he might have done, it was no worse than what was done by his predecessors in the White House; Victor Lasky chronicled prior presidential skullduggery in an underground classic from that era, It Didn’t Start With Watergate.

Yet Republican stalwarts were undercut and isolated when other Republicans broke ranks. Most famously, there was Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee, who always asked, in his TV-soundbite twang, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” Baker’s question could be construed as neutral, and yet there was always another layer of meaning in his voice; the subtext was, What did the president know—and when will we find out?

Meanwhile, other Republicans, such as Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, were openly hostile to Nixon and happy to help force him out of office.

So we can see: During Watergate, Republicans did not put up a united front; they broke ranks and scattered every which way. As a result, facing the inevitability of bipartisan impeachment and conviction, in August 1974, Nixon resigned. In a televised speech announcing his resignation, he put the end of his presidency in starkly political terms: “I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort”—that effort, of course, being the fight against impeachment and conviction.

Yet even though Republicans had scattered during Watergate, three months later, in November 1974, the GOP was clobbered in the midterm elections; the party lost four seats in the Senate and 49 seats in the House. Indeed, plenty of Republicans who had supported impeachment were defeated, including Rep. Larry Hogan of Maryland—the father of the current governor. (We can also add that both Baker and Weicker later ran for president; neither got very far, as Republican activists had not forgotten their anti-Nixon positioning; the next GOP presidential nominations went to Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bob Dole—all Nixon loyalists.)

Okay, so now we can skip ahead a quarter-century, to see what happens when a party sticks with its president. Short version: Unity works better.

During the 1998-99 investigation and impeachment of Bill Clinton—Monica Lewinsky, the blue dress, perjury, and all that—congressional Democrats rallied to defend the embattled 42nd president, as well as their individual seats.

In fact, during the investigation, Democrats didn’t just play defense; they actively went on offense. Democrat and allied media-diggers uncovered extramarital affairs in the private lives of top Republicans, including Reps. Bob Livingston and Henry Hyde. And those Republicans who couldn’t be painted as sexual hypocrites were trashed as censorious religious-right zealots. (Poor Monica Lewinsky: She was victimized too soon; it would be another two decades before the Harvey Weinstein case got liberals interested in defending victimized women.)

For the Democrats, the kitchen-sink strategy worked: In the 1998 midterm elections—which historical cycles said should have gone against them—they broke even in the Senate (one of those senatorial gainers was New York’s Chuck Schumer), and gained five seats in the House. It was a stupendous political upset, breaking any chance that Congress would actually remove Clinton from office.

So if we compare the results of 1974 to those of 1998, it’s obvious: It’s best to stay together and not lose cohesion. And oh yes, there’s a further point: The best defense is a good offense.

Did the Democrats Walk into a Trap of Their Own Making?

Okay, so now let’s move from Watergate and Monicagate to the new Beltway uproar: Russiagate—oops, that’s old news; maybe the Democrats will soon be calling it Ukrainegate, or Whistleblowergate. Or perhaps they’ll simply call it, Destroy Trump.

Interestingly, some Democrats have concerns about this new course; they are reminding themselves that the 2020 election is barely more than a year away—so why winch up the whole impeachment effort now? Why shift the focus from their presidential candidates to less popular figures, such as Nancy Pelosi and the Capitol Hill gang?

Hence this revealing CNN headline from September 25: “Some Democrats worry Pelosi may have acted too soon on impeachment.” As the article detailed, “There is grumbling about what happens if the transcript and report are not the smoking guns that everyone is hyping them to be.”

Indeed, when the transcript of President Trump’s July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released, the “smoking gun” that the Democrats had been hoping for was shown not to be smoking—and actually, it wasn’t even a gun.

Respected election-caller Charlie Cook commented, “I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript … This will not move malleable voters.” In that same deflated spirit, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni warned Democrats of the road ahead:

Any scenario is possible, including one in which impeachment redounds to Trump’s benefit and increases the chances of his re-election, because he paints himself a martyr, eludes conviction in the Senate, frames that as exoneration and watches his fans mobilize and turn out as never before.

Another Times columnist, David Brooks, was even more direct in warning Democrats against impeachment, saying that the American people would conclude that an arrogant capital was seeking to take power away from mere voters. Brooks summed up the gist of the message: “Democratic elites to voters: We don’t trust you. Too many of you are racists!”

Even the Times’ editorial board, the cheerleading flagship of national liberalism, conceded the risk to Democrats: “Mr. Trump has long argued—and continues to argue—that impeachment will benefit him politically. Many Democrats, including Ms. Pelosi, have not disputed that possibility.”

Breitbart News, of course, was more blunt: One of its headlines read, “Democrats Privately Panic Following Transcript, Impeachment Fallout.”

The danger for Democrats, of course, is that impeachment will turn out like the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, when the televised fireworks of September 2018 galvanized Republican voters and helped the GOP gain two Senate seats in the November elections.

So yes, the Democrats have their doubts about their current impeachment course. And yet they also know that it’s vital to stay united. Indeed, they further know, from 1998, that it’s even better to stay united while on the attack. So that’s what they’re doing—they’re acting as an army, going on the offensive.

AOC Blows the Trumpet

On September 25, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sounded the Democrats’ call to arms. Ignoring the obvious words on the page, she tweeted of the just-released Trump-Zelensky transcript, “It’s worse than we thought … We have no choice but to impeach.” As we have learned over the last century, falsehoods get “truthier” with repetition—at least that’s what demagogues strive for.

For its part, the Mainstream Media has been happy to fall in with the Democrats’ assault formation. Of course, reporters have their own wily ways; one favorite MSM tactic is to report on “splits” within Republican ranks, in the hope of wedging them wider.

The hope, of course, is that Sen. Mitt Romney, that opportunistic Trump-hater, can be multiplied—or metastasized. So here’s a helpful headline in the Washington Post: “Cracks emerge among Senate Republicans over Trump urging Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden.” And this headline in Politico: “Republicans twist as Trump’s Ukraine storm rages.” Such stories are notable for their lack of specifics, and yet for the Democrats, they are usable, serving the cause, they hope, of creating more Romney-type renegades.

Yet interestingly, the Democrats are attacking Trump for supposedly doing what they themselves have admitted to doing—namely, pushing Ukraine around. Yes, as we all know, Joe Biden, father of Hunter, bragged in a public forum last year that he had muscled Ukrainian officials: “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.”

In addition, as conservative pundit Marc Thiessen has pointed out, congressional Democrats, too, have sought to muscle Ukraine into changing its policies in order to advance their own political goals.

So yes, without a doubt, Democrats—joined, of course, by the MSM—are going to make an all-out push against Trump. They are finally following through on Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s notorious war whoop from January, “We’re going to impeach the motherf**ker!”

So on September 25, former top Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon was right to put the Democrats’ offensive in an appropriately martial context: “Pelosi’s announcement … was the shot at Fort Sumter.” In other words, Team Trump must be fully mobilized in its own defense.

In the meantime, the Ukraine-related details—more precisely, the allegations—keep coming fast and furious; by now it’s hard to recall that the original report about a “whistleblower” came only on September 18. And yet just in the past week or so, Democrats have worked themselves into a fury. Indeed, every day—seemingly every hour—brings a new accusatory headline, even if oftentimes the story soon falls apart.

Given this level of anything-goes enthusiasm, it matters little that the whistleblower’s complaint, released on September 26, contains no proof of wrongdoing and simply lots of argumentation about policy—which is not, of course, the province of a government underling.

Yes, this is the Deep State in action, and it’s out for blood; Virgil started writing about its stab-in-the-back methods back in December 2016. And so when the New York Times informs us that the whistleblower works for the CIA—the former domain of Trump-hater John Brennan—and is thus “nonpolitical,” well, that’s good for a Virgilian belly laugh. Indeed, when one considers the legal craftsmanship of the report, it’s obvious that the whistleblower had a lot of help in the researching and writing of the document.

Still, as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani observes of the whistleblower, he’s a finger-pointer who doesn’t actually point to anything that he saw first-hand: “He says ‘I was not a direct witness’ and additionally states over 20 times ‘I was told,’ ‘I am concerned,’ ‘I learned,’ and not once did he say ‘I know.’”

Meanwhile, courtesy of Sean Davis at The Federalist, we learn that the online submission form for a whistleblower report was changed in August—just a month before the anti-Trump upload—to eliminate the need for firsthand knowledge of an alleged incident. In other words, the form was changed seemingly for the benefits of a particular whistleblower. That’s a big “tell.” A tell, that is, that others within the government were working to help the whistleblower along. In other words, this wasn’t just an inside job, this was an inside conspiracy.

We can observe that someone who simply passes on gossip is not a whistleblower at all, but, rather, a troublemaker. Or maybe even a Soros-aided conspirator.

We’ll Keep Polling Till We Get the Answer We Want

The Democrats and their media pals know that impeachment is a hard sell; according to a Quinnipiac poll released on September 25, just 37 percent of Americans supported impeaching Trump, while 57 percent said “no.” We might pause over the language of the question, which was simple and straight-forward: “Do you think that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, or don’t you think so?”

Needless to say, a 20-point deficit in the impeachment question is not what the Democrats are looking for—that’s not how to build impeachment momentum. So for them, not liking the answer, it was time for a new question. That is, ask the “I-word” question in a way that gets the desired answer.

Much more to the Democrats’ liking was a poll from YouGov, which found that 55 percent of Americans either “strongly” or “somewhat” support impeachment. That’s more like it, say Democrat activists, one of whom was moved to tweet, “Tide is shifting *very* quickly. 22% of Republicans strongly support impeachment, 10% of Republicans somewhat support impeachment. Only 49% of Republicans oppose impeachment.”

Well, actually, not quite. If we look at the actual language of the question, we can see the contrast with the Quinnipiac poll. That is, the language of the YouGov question has been cooked to get the desired result: “If President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, would you support or oppose impeachment?”

In other words, YouGov is asking—and also, in a way, declaring—if we agree that Trump is guilty, then what should we do?

Another new poll, from Politico/Morning Consult, shows the same syndrome of bias: To get a “good” headline, ask a loaded question. Expect many more such loads to come.

So can the Democrats and the MSM succeed in stampeding the voters using bias-tactics such as this? We’ll have to wait and see; all we know now is that they’re going to give it their best shot.

Happily, in the face of this onslaught, almost all Republicans are sticking together and standing firm; sample tweet from Bill Hagerty, the likely Republican senatorial nominee in Tennessee next year: “The socialists in Washington are trying to impeach our president. I am proud to be endorsed by President @realDonaldTrump and will stand with him against the radical Left.”

Still, Romney and the Never Trump clique have deep pockets, full of money and media mojo; they can offer the proverbial “strange new respect,” and more to any Republican who breaks with Trump and the GOP.

Ukrainegate? Whistleblowergate? Bidengate!

We don’t yet know whether we’re going to see a replay of 1974 (the defending party splintered and defeated) or 1998 (the defending party unified and rewarded).

Yet this much does seem clear: Joe Biden’s presidential candidacy, once seen as an unstoppable dreadnought, is becoming distinctly Titanic-like.

As far back as April, investigative reporter John Solomon was laying out the stakes: “Joe Biden’s 2020 Ukrainian nightmare: A closed probe is revived.” Solomon pointed out that the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings was paying Hunter Biden’s outfit as much as $166,000 a month. For what, exactly?

In fact, Solomon has been writing knowingly about Russia and Ukraine for years; just on September 26 he cast further doubt on Joe Biden’s alibis.

As Michael Goodwin asked the other day in the New York Post, “Would Hunter Biden have gotten that job if his father were not vice president? Ditto for a sweetheart investment deal Hunter Biden got from the Chinese government.”

Indeed, the reality of Hunter Biden’s involvement in the international influence game is so obvious—hiding in plain sight, one might say—that even the Washington Post has to include sentences such as this: “Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.”

We can see: The case against the Bidens is right there, not actually hidden at all.

Some journalistic voices are urging a cease-and-desist on printing the truth about the Bidens; as one wrote recently, “Reporters should stop helping Donald Trump spread lies about Joe Biden and Ukraine.”

Yet the Biden candidacy is so ripe with juice—or so ripe with something—that reporters can’t stay away. For instance, Politico’s Ben Schreckinger has been working the Biden beat hard, coming up with investigative doozies such as, “Biden’s brother touted Biden Cancer Initiative ties in investment pitch: James Biden suggested the former vice president’s anti-cancer efforts could benefit potential investors, a litigant says. His spokesman denies it.”

Indeed, one prominent journo has concluded that Biden will end up as collateral damage in the coming impeach-o-rama; it’s hard to find more vivid phrasing than that of the Washington Post’s David von Drehle:

It was a terrible day for Biden, because while he was winning labor votes on the picket line, Democrats in Washington were freshly lathered over impeaching the president. And it appears they are going to feed Biden into a wood chipper. [Emphasis added]

Wood chipper? Ouch! It seems almost unnecessary to add that it’s hard to become the 46th president if you’ve been mashed into bloody fragments.

In other words, for all the Democrats’ cleverness, the one seemingly sure result of their new impeachment push is the wood-chipping of the man who has been regarded as their strongest presidential candidate.

Of course, if the name Bidengate were to stick—and it should—then maybe Biden was never, in reality, all that strong.

Or, to put the matter another way, maybe Trump is stronger than most observers have been willing to admit."

Appearing at the Texas Tribune’s Tribune Fest, Pelosi stated it’s more important for Congress to uphold its duty of holding the president accountable than maintaining power over the lower chamber.

“It doesn’t matter,” Pelosi replied when asked by Tribune CEO Evan Smith if she harbors any “anxiety” over the Democrats’ ability to keep the House if their impeachment inquiry goes awry.

“Our first responsibility is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” said the speaker.

“People say you have to take a political risk doing that,” she went on. “That doesn’t matter. Because we cannot have a president of the United States undermining his oath of office, his loyalty to his oath of office, undermining our national security, and undermining the integrity of our elections.”

Pelosi’s comments come after the speaker announced an impeachment inquiry this week against President Donald Trump over a telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the pair discussed U.S. military aid and the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden. The July 25th conversation was the subject of so-called “whistleblower” complaint, which according to its author, a CIA officer, is comprised entirely of second-hand knowledge of the call. Additionally, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel’s (OLC) affirmed that the Deep Stater has a bias in favor of a political rival of President Trump. Further, CBS News and Fox News report that the complaint includes inaccuracies, including the false claim charging that Ulrich Brechbuhl, the Counselor to the U.S. State Department, was on the call.

Notwithstanding, in a nod to transparency, the White House released the Trump-Zelensky call transcript on Wednesday. The complaint was published by the House Intelligence Committee the following day.

President Trump lambasted critics of the call in a pair of tweets Saturday, writing: “The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called “Whistleblower” knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong, just like Liddle’ Adam Schiff.”

“The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!” the president added."

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed Wednesday that the identity of the unknown “whistleblower” has a political bias in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 rivals.

The “whistleblower”— who is reported to be a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer— said in the complaint the knowledge was obtained from “White House officials” but was not firsthand knowledge, according to a Justice Department official.

Members of Congress had opinions largely along partisan lines about whether the “whistleblower” was really a true “whistleblower.”

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said in a Thursday interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow that the purported government bureaucrat not only does not meet the standard as a “whistleblower,” but is also someone with a political bias.

2020 Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a Friday CNN interview she feared for the “whistleblower’s” safety, framing the person as someone “trying to get to the truth.”"

The speaker, a professed Catholic, added:

These bans violate the Constitution. They ignore basic morality. They imperil the health and well-being of countless women.

“They are driven by hatred,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) declared. “They hate Bill and Hillary Clinton so much, they will stop at nothing to bring him down.”

“Impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election, and one of the reasons we all feel so angry about what they are doing is that they are ripping from us, they are ripping us under our votes,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said. “They are telling us that our votes don’t count.”

The flashback even features Joe Biden (D), who warned Congress to be careful and make “darn sure” that they are impeaching based on “principle not politics.”

Their remarks stand in stark contrast to their recent remarks.

The report by The Federalist’s Sean Davis raises questions about the intelligence community’s role amid a whistleblower complaint submitted against President Trump in August 2019, alleging he acted improperly when asking the president of Ukraine to assist in investigations into the origins of the Russia collusion allegations and alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Davis’s report said a new whistleblower complaint form did not require potential whistleblowers who wish to have their concerns expedited to Congress to have direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing they are reporting.

The new version of the whistleblower complaint form allowed employees to file complaints even if they have zero direct knowledge of underlying evidence and only “heard about” wrongdoing from others, according to Davis’s report.

According to Davis, a previous version of the whistleblower complaint form declared that any complaint must contain only first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoing and that complaints that provide only hearsay, rumor, or gossip would be rejected.

The whistleblower complaint against Trump, which was filed August 12, 2010, alleged Trump broke the law during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but acknowledged that the person making the complaint was “not a direct witness” to the wrongdoing he claimed Trump had committed.

“The [Intelligence Community Inspector General] cannot transmit information via the [Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act] based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing,” the form had previously stated under the bolded heading “FIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.” “This includes information received from another person, such as when an employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing.”

“If you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, [the Intelligence Community Inspector General] will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA,” the previous form said.

As Davis noted in his report:

The Ukraine call complaint against Trump is riddled not with evidence directly witnessed by the complainant, but with repeated references to what anonymous officials allegedly told the complainant: “I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials,” “officials have informed me,” “officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me,” “the White House officials who told me this information,” “I was told by White House officials,” “the officials I spoke with,” “I was told that a State Department official,” “I learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “One White House official described this act,” “Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me,” “I also learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “The U.S. officials characterized this meeting,” “multiple U.S. officials told me,” “I learned from U.S. officials,” “I also learned from a U.S. official,” “several U.S. officials told me,” “I heard from multiple U.S. officials,” and “multiple U.S. officials told me.”

Davis added:

The repeated references to information the so-called whistleblower never witnessed clearly run afoul of the original ICIG requirements for “urgent concern” submissions. The change to the ‘urgent concern’ submission form was first highlighted on Twitter by researcher Stephen McIntyre.

The complaint filed against Trump, in addition to using second-hand sources, cites news articles as proof for many of the allegations.

The complaint also makes a number of false accusations against Trump that have been debunked by the transcript the White House released of a call between Trump and Zelensky.

For example, the complaint alleged Trump demanded that Ukraine physically return multiple servers potentially related to ongoing investigations of foreign interference in the 2016 elections, but such a request was not made.

The complaint also falsely alleged that Trump told Zelensky that he should keep the current prosecutor general at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, in his current position in the country, but Trump also did not make such a request.

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel found the complaint to be deficient and not required to be submitted to Congress: “The complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community. Rather, the complaint arises out of a confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received secondhand. The question is whether such a complaint falls within the statutory definition of ‘urgent concern’ that the law requires the DNI to forward to the intelligence committees. We conclude that it does not.”"

Partial transcript as follows:

STEPHANOPOULOS: We begin with President Trump’s first homeland security advisor, Tom Bossert, whose core responsibilities included election security and helping coordinate the U.S. government response to Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Tom, thank you for joining us this morning. You know, the whistleblower’s complaint says that White House officials were deeply disturbed by the president phone call with Zelensky. What was your reaction?

BOSSERT: Yes, I’m deeply disturbed by it as well and this entire mess has me frustrated, George. Thanks for having me on. You and I both lived through the impeachment of President Clinton and saw how frustrating and dividing it can be, and I’ve just spent a week overseas, and I’ll tell you, the whole world is watching this. The removal of a president is a — is a big and serious deal. But the removal of a president in not only a democracy but the biggest democracy in the world is really a weighty matter and I hope that everyone can sift through the evidence and be very careful, as I’ve seen a lot of rush to judgment this week. That said, it is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent.

But it looks to me like the other matter that’s far from proven is whether he was doing anything to abuse his power and withhold aid in order to solicit such a thing. That seems to be far from proven and it’s going to be the focus of I think our Congress for the next year.

STEPHANOPOULOS: That’s the investigation. Let’s walk through some of what’s in the whistleblower’s complaint. And I want to show it up on the screen. It starts with President Zelensky saying “I’d really like to thank the president for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from United States for defense purposes.” And then the president says, “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say Crowdstrike…I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on. The whole situation.”

Now, what the president is referring to there is a debunked conspiracy theory that somehow Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic emails in 2016 and that Ukraine might have the DNC server or Hillary’s emails. The details are both convoluted and false. And during your time in the White House, you explained that to the president, right?

BOSSERT: I did. It’s not only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked. You know, I — I don’t want to be glib about this matter, but last year retired former senator Judd Gregg wrote a piece in The Hill Magazine, saying the three ways or the five ways to impeach oneself. And the third way was to hire Rudy Giuliani. And at this point I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.

And for clarity here, George, let me just again repeat that it has no validity. United States government reached its conclusion on attributing to Russia the DNC hack in 2016 before it even communicated it to the FBI, long before the FBI ever knocked on the door at the DNC. So a server inside the DNC was not relevant to our determination to the attribution. It was made up front and beforehand. And so while servers can be important in some of the investigations that followed, it has nothing to do with the U.S. government’s attribution of Russia of the DNC hack.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yet the president keeps on repeating it. You — you — you condemned Mayor Giuliani for continuing to tell the president (inaudible). How do you explain why the president brings this up in a meeting with the Ukrainian president? That is a form of pressure, isn’t it?

BOSSERT: Well, I didn’t see, like others have seen, pressure in this call. I understand why people are interpreting it that way. But I’ve spent a lot of time with this president, and I can easily see other reasons for why this president might have delayed the aide to Ukraine and those Javelin missiles. In fact, as you know, President Obama considered this deeply and decided not to provide lethal military support. President Trump and I and others spent quite a bit of time talking about this. In fact, in the call itself, although there are a lot of other reasons, he alludes to one that’s kind of quintessentially Donald Trump, and that is his frustration that Angela Merkel and the German nation member of NATO is doing nothing to help Ukraine, and — and he expressed some lamentation over that fact. So why he delayed is the key question. And — and — and you know, important, George, to remind everyone that he did ultimately provide the money and the Javelin missiles…

STEPHANOPOULOS: And that’s your…

BOSSERT: …but this was the second time that he considered doing it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And that’s your judgment on whether or not it would be an impeachable offense. But on its face, requesting the Ukrainian president to investigate this debunk conspiracy theory and to investigate a political rival, that’s not appropriate for a president, is it?

BOSSERT: The DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go. They have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated in our — in our discourse. On the other matter, I honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation. I believe he and his legal team have been looking into this, probably even prior to Joe Biden announcing that he would run for president. And they’re continuing to focus on everything they can, in their belief — understandably, in this case — that the president was wrongly accused of colluding with Russia the first time around. But George, if he continues to focus on that white whale, it’s going to bring him down. Enough. The investigation’s over. There was no evidence of collusion. He’s won and he should take that victory and move forward."

One of several themes is financing tied to Google, whose Google Capital led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike. Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party.

CrowdStrike was mentioned by Trump in his call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, reportedly helped draft CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC’s allegedly hacked server.

On behalf of the DNC and Clinton’s campaign, Perkins Coie also paid the controversial Fusion GPS firm to produce the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

CrowdStrike is a California-based cybersecurity technology company co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch.

Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia. The Council in turn is financed by Google Inc.

In a perhaps unexpected development, another Atlantic Council funder is Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Those allegations were the subject of Trump’s inquiry with Zelemsky related to Biden. The Biden allegations concern significant questions about Biden’s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period when Hunter Biden received $50,000 a month from Burisma.

Besides Google and Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros’s Open Society Foundations as well as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department.

Google, Soros’s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower’s complaint alleging Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 presidential race.

The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the whistleblower’s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower’s own claims, as Breitbart News documented.

One key section of the so-called whistleblower’s document claims that “multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.”

This was allegedly to follow up on Trump’s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the “cases” mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower’s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.

Even though the statement was written in first person – “multiple U.S. officials told me” – it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

That footnote reads:

In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.

The so-called whistleblower’s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:

Write that Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko “also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.”

Document that Trump adviser Rudi Giuliani “had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.”

Bolster the charge that, “I also learned from a U.S. official that ‘associates’ of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.” The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, “I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.”

The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a “joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.”

BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.

The OCCRP and BuzzFeed “joint investigation” resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump’s political rivals.

The so-called whistleblower’s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.

Together with Soros’s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are “disputed.”

Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute’s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros’ Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy.

CrowdStrike and DNC servers

CrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky.

According to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people…The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

In his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not “obtain or examine” the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia.

The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI.

In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered “multiple requests at different levels,” to review the DNC’s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a “highly respected private company”—a reference to CrowdStrike—would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified.

A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC.

“The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” the official was quoted by the news media as saying.

“This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,” the official continued.

Biden, Ukraine and Burisma

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving Burisma, the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

Biden publically boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

Yoshiko M. Herrera, a Russia and Eurasian policy expert from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was quoted by the Washington Post saying that Biden’s position was “a conflict of interest even if it doesn’t break any laws.”

“Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,” Herrera stated. “Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.”

A New York Times editorial posited that Hunter Biden’s role in the board of Burisma undermined his father’s credibility in Ukraine issues.

The newspaper opined:

Sadly, the credibility of Mr. Biden’s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices. A spokesman for the son, Hunter Biden, argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance. That may be so. But Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine. It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father’s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.

""Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called 'Whistleblower,' represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,"" Trump tweeted before taking aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff who confirmed earlier Sunday there is a tentative agreement for the whistleblower to testify before his committee.

""His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,"" Trump said.

Lawyers for the whistleblower sent a letter to the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Saturday outlining ""serious"" safety concerns for their client as Trump continues to take aim at the person.

""The purpose of this letter is to formally notify you of serious concerns we have regarding our client's personal safety,"" the letter says, adding that recent comments by Trump are reason for ""heightened"" concern."

The letter marks one instance of what the Washington Post reported Saturday as a wide-scale reclassification of emails sent to Clinton's private email by as many as 130 current and former senior State Department officials.

The recent change in the investigation was an effort to harass diplomats for doing their job, several people told the Post, as Trump had made Clinton's use of private email servers during her tenure as secretary of state a staple of his 2016 presidential campaign rhetoric.

Trump weighed in on Clinton's emails again Sunday night, slamming her for ""33,000 emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found.""

The report of the intensifying email probe against Trump's former political rival comes days after the release of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential 2020 political rival, and his son, Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

House Democrats this past week launched a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.

The former official told CNN he first received a letter by mail from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security in January 2018, years after leaving the government. The letter alerted him that some of his emails sent on the unclassified system should have been sent on a classified system.

Then on August 5, another letter from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security was sent -- this time in an email -- informing him of the change in status of the emails.

""It has been determined that, at the time they were sent, a number of these emails contained classified information which were not property marked as such,"" the letter stated.

The official told CNN that it appeared to him the emails were reviewed again, but with a stricter criteria because more emails were flagged in the second letter that the agency said should have been labeled classified. The official said he has talked to multiple former and current State Department colleagues who received a new letter and that there is a lot of confusion among them about why this is happening now.

Current and former officials told the Post dozens of officials have been contacted in recent weeks by investigators at the State Department.

Those targeted, including senior officials as well as others in lower-level jobs, have been notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now are potential security violations, the newspaper said.

While a former senior US official familiar with the email investigation told the Post that the email investigation is a way for Republicans ""to keep the Clinton email issue alive,"" senior State Department officials countered to the newspaper that they are following standard protocol in an investigation that began before Trump became President.

An FBI investigation found that of the 30,000 emails Clinton provided in 2014 to the State Department from her server, 110 contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. The agency did not recommend charges against Clinton, though then-FBI Director James Comey rebuked her and her aides for being ""extremely careless."""

(CNN) President Donald Trump once hailed himself as the "" most transparent president ever ."" This week, however, we learned that Trump's team took unprecedented steps to hide readouts of his conversations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russian President Vladimir Putin and members of the Saudi royal family. (The White House has only confirmed that it moved a readout of the President's call with Zelensky to a special server that's supposed to be used for codeword-level intelligence.)

The impact of this revelation on US national security has already been devastating. While the House of Representatives investigates whether Trump violated the Constitution in allegedly seeking help from a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 presidential elections, national security officials need to manage the adverse impacts of the President's actions in real time, all while trying to do their day jobs.

Foreign counterparts are also less likely to be forthcoming with the President and other US officials if they're worried that readouts of their communications may one day end up in news reports or as part of a congressional investigation.

Red flag alert

White House officials and the President should spend their time mitigating counterintelligence risks -- not adding to them.

And yet, since the 2016 campaign, Trump and his team's activities have heightened counterintelligence concerns. The whistleblower complaint alleging that the White House hid records of Trump's conversations with foreign officials by storing them in a highly classified computer system isn't helping matters.

But it's not the first potential breach. In other cases, the White House reportedly failed to document conversations with world leaders in the first place. These activities raise serious red flags, because they could mean that foreign governments know more about the President, along with his comments and intentions, than key members of his own government. That gives them leverage to manipulate or blackmail Trump, especially if the President said something that was incriminating or embarrassing.

Here's a case in point: When Trump met with two senior Russian officials in 2017, he told them he was ""unconcerned"" about the Kremlin's 2016 election interference because, he claimed, the US did the same thing, according to the Washington Post . While US officials were working to secure our elections, the Russians knew that the President was unconcerned and that if this statement became public it could be damaging to him. Trump was directly undercutting his team's critical work, while offering the Russians leverage over him.

Home team disadvantage

Failing to document presidential conversations is a violation of the Presidential Records Act and failing to distribute readouts -- whether verbally or in writing -- hamstrings the President's team in real ways, while also creating counterintelligence risks.

In the rough transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky, the US President said, ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."" But the Justice Department issued a statement on Wednesday that said, ""The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son."" If the White House failed to give Barr a readout of a call in which he was designated, by name, as a point of contact for follow-up, we don't know what other key conversations the President has failed to relay to members of his own Cabinet.

By hiding the transcript, Trump's team also hindered the ability of our intelligence community to do their jobs effectively. Authorized intelligence analysts need to know what the President said to a foreign official, otherwise they may hear about the President's comments during their intelligence collection on foreign sources and have no way of knowing if it's accurate and whether to pass it on.

Small group involved

News that the White House didn't give a readout of the July 25 meeting to key officials, while Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was put in touch with the Ukrainians, probably just furthers the signal globally that the President prefers to keep a small group involved in doing his bidding rather than engaging actual experts and official channels. The President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been accused of leaving the former Secretary of State in the dark when it comes to meeting with foreign leaders, and the whistleblower's complaint likely adds to perceptions that working through official channels like the Department of Justice aren't always the President's preferred course of action.

While the Justice Department said Barr didn't get a readout of the call, the whistleblower complaint alleges two State Department officials -- US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker -- met with the Ukrainians the day after the call to ""navigate"" the President's demands of Zelensky. Shortly after, Volker put a Ukrainian official in touch with Giuliani but not with Barr.

According to the whistleblower, Pompeo's senior staff member, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the counselor for the Department of State, was also listening in (an allegation State denies), so, if he did, it is likely that he gave Pompeo a readout along with Sondland and Volker, given their reported activities following up on the President's demands a day after the call.

What we don't yet know is whether key career diplomats at the State Department were looped in, like our acting ambassador ( charge d'affaires ) at the Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. But what is clear is that while Trump told Zelensky that Barr and Giuliani would call him -- only Giuliani was put in touch with the Ukrainians.

The State Department confirmed weeks ago that it put Giuliani in touch with the Ukrainians. And the whistleblower complaint only furthers the perception that the President's friends -- like Giuliani -- get the readouts and support they need while key US officials don't. That could further lead other governments to stop working through vetted, official channels and just call Giuliani or another one of the President's inner personal circle to follow up on calls and meetings.

Day jobs matter

While the Trump administration prepares to deal with congressional investigations, they also have day jobs to do. Whether they respond to or stonewall congressional subpoenas, requests and depositions, the impeachment inquiry will be a drain on resources -- especially for officials working on key issues like Ukraine.

Their efforts should be focused on important bilateral work, like deterring Russian aggression and trying to stop the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. Because of the President's actions, and the alleged activities detailed in the whistleblower complaint, US officials will need to divert critical time and attention to responding to the investigations, while America's enemies and allies alike will know that US officials are distracted."

In a highly unusual letter to the major networks — including CNN — on Sunday, the Biden campaign said booking Giuliani does a disservice to viewers.

The letter from Biden officials Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield says ""we ask that you no longer book him on your air."" Barring that, the Biden campaign wants ""an equivalent amount of time"" to be provided ""to a surrogate for the Biden campaign.""

It was sent to the moderators of the Sunday shows, their executive producers, and the heads of their respective news divisions. Those networks had no immediate comment on Sunday afternoon. CBS and CNN declined to comment.

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Jordan on Ukraine scandal,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/29/politics/jim-jordan-ukraine-fact-check-jake-tapper-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, and CNN's Jake Tapper got into a contentious exchange Sunday after the lawmaker made false and misleading claims about the unfolding Ukraine drama that has led to an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

During a tense interview with Tapper on ""State of The Union,"" the Ohio Republican attempts to give his spin on the drama, making unsubstantiated claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, though there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either.

On Jordan's claims about the Bidens

""The vice president's son gets paid $50,000 a month and gets hired by a company in an industry he has no experience in and oh that's fine?"" Jordan says, referring to Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. ""Try taking that message to the American people ... When they see the vice president's son getting paid $50,000 a month in a field, in an industry he has no experience in ... And then when the company that's paying that money is under investigation, guess what? Daddy comes running to the rescue. The vice president of the United States comes running in and says, 'Fire that prosecutor.' ""

""That's not what happened. Sir, sir, that's not what happened,"" Tapper responds. ""The European Union, the Obama administration, the International Monetary Fund, pro-clean government activists in Ukraine, (all) thought that the prosecutor was not prosecuting corruption.""

""So you're saying Joe Biden didn't tell Ukraine to fire that prosecutor? I think he did,"" the congressman says.

""He did, but the guy was not prosecuting anything. That was the problem,"" Tapper replies.

""Here are the facts,"" Jordan says, before Tapper interjects, saying: ""You're not saying facts, you say, 'Here are the facts,' these are not.""

""Did Joe Biden tell him to fire the prosecutor?"" Jordan asks again.

""Because he wasn't going after corruption. He wasn't going after corruption. Do you understand what I'm saying?"" Tapper replies.

According to CNN's fact check , the Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, among others, had all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general in 2015.

Shokin was widely faulted for declining to bring prosecutions of elites' corruption, and he was even accused of hindering corruption investigations. His deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned in February 2016, alleging that Shokin's office was itself corrupt.

""Was that prosecutor looking into Burisma, the company that had hired Joe Biden's son for $50,000 a month?"" Jordan says.

""According to the Ukrainians, that investigation was dormant at the time,"" Tapper said, adding later: ""If you want to push a law saying that the children of presidents and vice presidents should not be doing international business deals, I'm all for it. But you're setting a standard that is not being met right now.""

Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. According to CNN's fact check, there is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

On Jordan's claims about the whistleblower

During his interview with Jordan, Tapper also fact-checked the congressman on his statements about the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump's communications with Zelensky revealed this week that the White House took extraordinary steps to conceal the call.

""Two things you look at to determine the credibility of a so-called whistleblower when they're coming forward,"" Jordan says. ""First, did they have firsthand knowledge? And second, what is their motivation? Was there some kind of bias? This individual has problems on both of those counts. He had no firsthand knowledge, he heard something from someone who may have heard something from someone.""

""No, no, his sources were firsthand sources,"" Tapper replies.

""But he has no firsthand knowledge. And second, he has a political bias. That should tell us something about this guy who came forward with this claim,"" Jordan says.

""You know as well as I do, that you do not need to have firsthand knowledge to be a whistleblower,"" replies Tapper.

""Well, you don't now because they changed the form. You used to,"" Jordan contends.

""There's no evidence of that. And we looked into this,"" Tapper says. ""It has never been true that you need to have firsthand knowledge to be a whistleblower.""

""But it's something that's critical when you're assessing if they're credible. That's a major determination,"" Jordan replies.

CNN reported earlier this month that the whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications that partly prompted the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general, according to an official briefed on the matter. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

The whistleblower's attorney, Andrew Bakaj, had no comment when asked about the claim that the individual did not have direct knowledge of the communication in question."

""The Senate impeachment rules are very clear,"" said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, in an interview with CNBC. ""The Senate would have to take up an impeachment resolution if it came over from the House.""

Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, asserting that Trump had used his office for personal political gain in July, when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden , a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

A whistleblower's complaint and a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky conversation publicly released last week by the Trump administration have become the basis of the House Democrats' investigation, which they hope to complete this fall. The Democratic-controlled House needs only a simple majority to pass articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate is required to convict and remove the President from office.

On Saturday, a Senate GOP leadership aide told reporters that ""there is no way we could somehow bar the doors and prevent the managers from presenting the articles"" to the Senate. On CNBC Monday, McConnell made clear that the Senate must consider articles of impeachment. But he added that the amount of time spent on a trial is ""a whole different matter.""

In a statement released today, the IC IG said the whistleblower had “direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct.”

The statement appears to debunk a theory that has been pushed by Trump and several of his Republican allies who have sought to raise questions about the complaint’s credibility by falsely claiming that it is based on “hearsay.”

“As part of his determination that the urgent concern appeared credible, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that the complainant had official and authorized access to the information and sources referenced in the complainant’s letter and classified appendix, including direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct, and that the complainant has subject matter expertise related to much of the material information provided in the complainant’s letter and classified appendix,” the statement said.

“In short, the ICIG did not find that the complainant could ‘provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions,’ which would have made it much harder, and significantly less likely, for the Inspector General to determine in a 14-calendar day review period that the complaint ‘appeared credible,’ as required by statute. Therefore, although the complainant’s letter acknowledged that the complainant was not a direct witness to the President’s July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG’s preliminary review supported the complainant’s allegations,” the statement reads.

The IC IG response makes it clear that a whistleblower is not required to have first-hand knowledge in order to submit a complaint and confirms that the IC IG obtained other information during his preliminary review that supported the allegations."

What is Trump talking about? Good question!

At issue is how US law enforcement handled the Democratic National Committee server, which was hacked by the Russians during the 2016 election. A company called Crowdstrike, which runs cybersecurity investigations for the US government, was called in by the DNC to handle the server. Eventually, the FBI looked at the imaged copies of the DNC server -- essentially an electronic copy of everything that was on the server -- as the feds conducted their own investigation.

Andreii Telizhenko, who worked in the Ukrainian embassy in Washington between December 2015 and May 2016, says Rudy Giuliani approached him for a face-to-face meeting in May of this year.

And Sergeii Leschenko, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, says Giuliani began applying pressure on Zelensky's team to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter shortly after the former comedian was elected in April 2019.

Each has a different perspective on the crisis -- Telizhenko believes that the issues surrounding Biden merit further investigation -- but both agree that Giuliani was open in his motivations.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Joe or Hunter Biden.

Telizhenko is known for his repeated claims in the media that Democrats colluded with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump and his team in an effort to boost Hilary Clinton's chances in the 2016 elections. These claims have been repeatedly debunked.

According to Telizhenko, he and Giuliani spent about six hours in New York in late May of this year and discussed a range of issues including the business dealings of Hunter Biden in Ukraine.

Asked what was discussed, he replied: ""My insights on what's happening with the US-Ukrainian relationship and the DNC Ukraine collusion was also mentioned. Mr. Giuliani also asked me about Vice President Biden, what my thoughts was, what were my insights on him.""

When asked if this line of inquiry was a priority for Giuliani, Telizhenko responded, ""Yes, he doesn't hide it, it's his work, that's what he was hired to do -- to represent the President of the United States and his personal interests.""

Telizhenko, who is 29 and a frequent visitor to Washington, says he has met with Giuliani about two or three times since their initial meeting, and insists that the debunked conspiracy theories against the Democratic Party should be investigated by both the US and Ukraine.

""No, there is no conspiracy theories. We need to investigate this properly to show to the public there is no conspiracy theories, or maybe there are, but that's what we have to find out.""

Leschenko is clear about Giuliani's motives. ""For Giuliani it was the only interest in Ukraine,"" Leschenko told CNN. ""To get this information about Biden and to use this information in the US. He was not interested in Ukraine at all -- what is going on here, [the] reform process, or anti-corruption effort, nothing. He was just focused on this topic.""

When asked if he believed Giuliani was acting on behalf of Trump, Leschenko says there was little room for doubt. ""For sure (it was) not for his private purposes. He is not, let's say, a private person to be interested in this whole mess, but just because he had relations with [the] American President.""

He recounted a conversation with a close associate of President Zelensky: ""I met with some official from this administration before this inauguration and he said we know who Giuliani is, we know what is his role, we know that he is acting not just a private person but on behalf of his client (Trump).""

He added, ""It was a clear fact that Giuliani acted on behalf of Trump and they are interested in Biden.""

Giuliani's probes did not go unnoticed by an incoming Ukrainian administration desperate for US support and military aid to battle Russian-backed separatist rebels fighting for control of the country's eastern regions. ""No one wanted to start the presidency with a conflict with American counterparts,"" Leschenko said.

CNN has asked Giuliani for comment. He has previously denied any wrongdoing and defended his efforts to get a Ukrainian investigation launched.

""How is it possible that after the country was torn apart by the Russian interference in the 2016 election and its aftermath, and after (President Donald) Trump himself endured almost two years under the searing spotlight of an investigation into that very thing, how is it possible that he could reach out to another country and -- according to a whistleblower complaint -- attempt another round of election interference? How is that possible?""

Her answer: ""Trump has apparently come to believe that he is so brilliant, so talented, so invincible , that he could get away with defying every norm, every practice, every institution of the democracy he is charged with leading.""

In a word from ancient Greece: hubris.

described it another way: ""Trump's decision to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political opponent one day after the country heard special counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress suggests a man with a political death wish .""

One thing worked well for candidate Donald Trump in 2016. His ability to nickname and define his political rivals swiftly and mercilessly froze everyone else out of the Republican nomination and then helped secure him an Electoral College victory over Hillary Clinton. So, according to documents released this past week, he decided to do it again -- by tarring 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden as dishonest and mired in a Ukraine corruption investigation -- despite the lack of evidence that the former vice president had done anything wrong.

But is this election fundamentally different from 2016, with Trump as President seeking re-election rather than as an unlikely candidate?

Peter Bergen: "" Last week's disclosures explained why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an inquiry that could lead to Trump's impeachment, wrote: "" A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.""

Elie Honig noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: Why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.""

Josh Campbell said we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" Trump famously punches back at critics. And former FBI supervisory special agentsaid we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal , publicly blasting the whistleblower as a 'partisan,' even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The President denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been 'beautiful.' And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as 'the Ukraine witch hunt.'""

Now what?

As congressional committees investigate, people are looking ahead to the debate over whether Trump's actions are indeed impeachable.

Frank Bowman III is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: ""If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is.""

Forty-five years ago, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned within two weeks. Bowman wrote, ""Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept 'plumbers' looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.""

Paul Callan: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. Trump's tendency to ""speak in a code,"" as Trump fixer Michael Cohen explained to a Congressional committee, is worth remembering when you read the rough transcript of the President's call with Zelensky, wrote: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The 'stick' or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.""

Marc Thiessen of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used US aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was 'normal' and 'nobody pushed me.' Career public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department also reviewed the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call and found there was no campaign finance crime to pursue.""

Julian Zelizer. ""There is a compelling argument that Many have written about the pressure a vote for impeachment would place on moderate Democrats elected in districts where Trump won in 2016. But the real test is of Republicans, who profess faith in limited government and the rule of law, wrote. ""There is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles . In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.""

Michael D'Antonio wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful. Now that the cracks are beginning to show, he cannot count on anyone's genuine affection or loyalty. So far, congressional Republicans have been more lukewarm than usual in their support of Trump, amid reports that a majority of GOP senators would oppose the President, if they could vote to remove him in secret (they can't). ""The President achieved his dominance over the GOP by making just about everyone in the party afraid of him,""wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful. Now that the cracks are beginning to show, he cannot count on anyone's genuine affection or loyalty. And he has given those who will control his fate reason to regard him as expendable.""

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint is certainly worthy of investigation, but is an inappropriate phone call an impeachable offense? Is there evidence of a quid pro quo? Is there a case to be made that President Trump engaged in a ""betrayal of his oath of office""? Or is this a rush to judgment at a time we need to slow down and look at the facts?

Alice Stewart

It's not a heavy lift to find Republicans who have, at some point, looked at President Trump's actions and said, ""I would not have done that"" or ""I would not have said it that way."" I count myself among them. With that as a starting point, it's important to consider the credibility of the whistleblower complaint, the calculation of the Democrats and the collateral damage that will likely result from the impeachment proceedings.

Credibility of complaint:

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday that the whistleblower did the right thing and the complaint was ""credible"" and ""important.""

That's true, from the standpoint that the complaint follows the appropriate protocol and reporting procedures. The official complaint is a clearly calculated document, more likely prepared by an attorney than the work of a rank-and-file member of the intelligence community.

Things started benignly enough. On Friday night, September 20, the President's personal attorney attended a black-tie state dinner at the White House , smiling for cameras alongside his girlfriend Maria Ryan. Yet a week later, Giuliani was under siege, and at the heart of events that have led to the first formal impeachment inquiry into a president in 20 years.

In between, Giuliani conducted a one-man messaging war, going on Fox News at least four times, talking to numerous reporters, and sending more than 50 tweets, many of which were about Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their alleged dealings in Ukraine.

It was a surreal climax for Giuliani's 10-month, quixotic mission aimed at proving his theory that the origins of the investigation into Russian election interference can be traced back to Democrats' dealings in Ukraine. Along the way he went to Warsaw, Madrid, and very nearly Ukraine. He met with foreign nationals, coordinated with US State Department officials, dropped vague, confusing accusations in cable-TV appearances, and ceaselessly pitched US journalists on what he claims is one of the biggest scandals in modern American history— all while whispering in Donald Trump's ear about how Ukraine contained the keys to revealing truths about the President's political rivals.

The loose, slipshod strategy was designed to push a counternarrative about the true origins of the Russian investigation. ( Stirring up trouble for Biden was an added benefit.) Instead, in a dizzying reversal, Giuliani's actions boomeranged back on the President this week with stunning speed. By Friday, not only were Trump and Giuliani's Ukraine dealings the focus of the impeachment inquiry , but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been subpoenaed and the top US diplomat to Ukraine had resigned

Giuliani himself now faces the prospect of being in the crosshairs of the House's impeachment investigation.

Speaking Friday with CNN's Jim Sciutto, Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, did not rule out calling on Giuliani to testify or even subpoenaing him. ""I obviously have several questions for him,"" Quigley said.

Giuliani said he would not testify without consulting his client, Trump, and that testimony about his work for the President should be protected by attorney-client privilege.

""Ultimately, if I were to say yes and he were to say no, I can't testify,"" Giuliani told CNN Friday . Not long after, news broke that he had told Sky News essentially the opposite that he would in fact testify.

Asked if he was concerned he would be subpoenaed by the House, Giuliani laughed.

""I consider them a joke. A sad joke. They have no legitimacy. I would think of challenging their subpoena on the grounds that they're not a legitimate committee,"" Giuliani said.

Through it all, Giuliani has put up a defiant front. ""What they should be doing is giving me an award for uncovering something that when it's looked back on, someone's going to say, 'Why were you all asleep?'"" he told CNN Thursday.

Rudy goes rogue

Rudy Giuliani finds himself at the heart of the events that led to President Trump's impeachment battle

Giuliani's role in Ukraine can be traced back to November 2018, when he was contacted by someone he describes as a ""well-known investigator"" who connected him with a Ukrainian-American businessman in Florida named Lev Parnas.

Through Parnas, who did not respond to CNN's request for comment, Giuliani began speaking with multiple Ukrainian nationals about information about two subjects of interest to his client, President Trump.

The first regarded what Giuliani has described as collusion between Democrats and Ukraine during the 2016 election. The second is the claim that Vice President Biden had pressured Ukraine to halt an investigation connected to his own son.

One of the people Giuliani says he spoke with in December 2018, over Skype, was Viktor Shokin, Ukraine's former prosecutor general. In 2016, Biden was among multiple Western leaders who successfully urged Ukraine to dismiss Shokin from the country's top prosecutor position, citing his insufficient work to root out corruption.

Viktor Shokin in 2015

But Shokin told Giuliani a different story: that he was pushed out to stop an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company that included Hunter Biden as a compensated board member.

That story is littered with holes, and neither Giuliani nor anyone else has provided any evidence of actual wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president.""

There is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever under investigation.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the Ukrainian government's case against Burisma had been ""dormant"" since 2014, two years before Shokin was dismissed at Biden's urging. Furthermore, Biden was also joined in his anti-corruption push against the prosecutor by numerous leaders in Europe as well as the International Monetary Fund -- none of whom had any family ties to Burisma.

Giuliani kept pursuing both stories, the Biden allegations and the so-called collusion in the 2016 election. Giuliani says he twice met with Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko -- in New York in January 2019, then in Warsaw in February. Giuliani told CNN he learned more about both cases from Lutsenko, and that he also heard about Lutsenko's dissatisfaction with the US ambassador's supposed request that he drop certain prosecutions. In an April interview with the Babel, a Ukrainian news outlet, Lutsenko confirmed this account of their conversations.

Yuriy Lutsenko speaks during a briefing at the Central Election Commission in Kiev, Ukraine earlier this year.

According to the whistleblower's complaint, Giuliani's interactions with Ukrainian officials prompted concern among US officials about the ""circumvention of national security decision-making processes.""

Indeed, Giuliani's actions alarmed a number of career State Department officials , prompting some of them to keep distance between their work and his, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Specifically, they worried that being involved with his efforts would mean they were acting with a partisan political agenda, which as career foreign service officers they were not permitted to do.

Giuliani told CNN this week he never heard about any of those concerns. ""If they were going to get upset about this, they should have gotten upset about it in January or February,"" he said.

But there were limits to Giuliani's freelance diplomacy, and it turns out Lutsenko was hardly a reliable source of information. That's partly due to the fact that Lutsenko's hold on power was precarious following Ukraine's April presidential election. Lutsenko may also have had ulterior motives for pushing the Biden conspiracy with Giuliani. The transition between presidents in Ukraine meant that his job as prosecutor general was in jeopardy, and having a line to a close adviser to the US President was a good way to stay relevant.

Indeed, Lutsenko would end up backing off some of his claims that Giuliani worked to amplify, including that his office was reopening its investigation into Burisma and Biden. Lutsenko would leave his position as prosecutor general on August 29.

The administration gets involved

JUST WATCHED Cuomo presses Giuliani on Ukraine: Give me the proof Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cuomo presses Giuliani on Ukraine: Give me the proof 01:22

The public first got wind of Giuliani's Ukraine actions in May, when press reports, including one in the New York Times, described how Giuliani was promoting allegations about Biden and Burisma.

At the time, Giuliani told reporters, including CNN, that he was planning to travel to Ukraine to gather more information. Within a day of reports of his trip however, Giuliani canceled, telling CNN he was concerned that President-elect Zelensky had advisers around him who were ""very vocal opponents of President Trump and peculiarly vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton"" and that his trip would have accomplished little.

From there, the story faded from public view, but Giuliani kept working behind the scenes. A crucial development came on July 19, when Giuliani says the State Department's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, offered to place him in touch with one of Zelensky's top advisers, Andriy Yermak.

At about the same time, Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine. Trump has denied his decision to delay the aid had anything to do with his desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden.

Over the next two weeks, Giuliani told CNN he spoke with Yermak at least two times on the phone. He also said he reported back to Volker and the State Department on his conversations with Yermak.

According to the whistleblower complaint, ""multiple officials"" told the whistleblower that Ukrainian officials were ""led to believe that a meeting or phone call between"" Trump and Zelensky would depend on Zelensky's willingness to ""play ball"" on the cases raised by Giuliani.

Several days after the July 25 call, Giuliani told CNN he met with Yermak in person in Madrid on August 1.

After their meeting, Giuliani told CNN that he called Volker to relay the message he'd gotten from Yermak— that Zelensky was ridding himself of ""leftovers and bad actors.""

""I relayed back to him that I thought the guy was straight,"" Giuliani told CNN.

The whistleblower's complaint claims US officials characterized the August Madrid meeting as a ""direct follow-up"" to Trump's call with Zelensky.

Giuliani told CNN he was not aware that his August 1 meeting with Yermak was intended to follow up on Trump's call with Zelensky. Giuliani claimed he was unaware that Zelensky and Trump had brought his name up. He also said he never spoke with Trump about his meetings with Yermak. Giuliani claimed to CNN that he was not aware that he had been brought up in the July 25 phone call.

A wild week

By Tuesday night, Giuliani was texting and calling with CNN, mocking House speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement about the impeachment inquiry. Minutes later, he was on Fox News , echoing his claim to CNN that he had a phone full of text messages proving that he was acting at the behest of US officials.

""I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it,"" he told Laura Ingraham Tuesday.

The next morning, the White House released the transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, and Giuliani was relatively quiet and unresponsive to text messages from CNN.

But on Thursday, however, things ramped up again. The whistleblower complaint was released and the acting Director of National Intelligence was at a hearing in front the House Intelligence Committee. And it put Giuliani in full-attack mode.

Included in the complaint was the whistleblower's claim that two State Department officials had spoken to Giuliani to ""contain the damage"" he was doing to US national security interests regarding his work with Ukraine -- something Giuliani strongly disputed.

""At no time did either one of them say they wanted to contain damage,"" Giuliani told CNN . ""At no time did the State Department in communication with me ever relay any of that information you're talking about.""

Again, Giuliani went out of his way on the phone to CNN to point out that he had been in touch with Volker, telling CNN he had a ""nice little trail"" of text message conversations with Volker that would prove the State Department was fully aware of his actions regarding Ukraine.

But by now, the damage was done. Giuliani's involvement was enough not only to help prompt the House's impeachment inquiry but to raise the possibility he could be a witness.

Kurt Volker, United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, resigned on Friday

Events began to move very quickly by Friday afternoon. News first broke that House Democrats had subpoenaed Pompeo. A few hours later, Volker resigned from his post as the top diplomat to Ukraine. Giuliani's defense of himself -- that his Ukraine work had the blessing of the State Department -- was already causing heads to roll.

The 75-year-old former mayor, speaking with CNN Friday, was practically sanguine about this last development.

""He seemed like a very knowledgeable guy to me,"" said Giuliani, when asked about Volker's departure. ""And a decent guy."""

Trump meanwhile escalated his attacks on the whistleblower -- demanding to meet his ""accuser"" face to face during a day of rage-filled tweets about the Democratic attempt to impeach him.The President's anger spilled over during a day of rage-filled tweets Sunday in which he selectively quoted a supporter who said he was afraid of a ""Civil War-like fracture"" in the country if Trump is forced from office.

The extraordinary spectacle of the President -- the titular head of the US legal system -- threatening a potential witness in a case against him risks being seen as an attempt to obstruct the investigation. It also cuts against the principle that whistleblowers deserve anonymity and protection, representing another dark twist in an administration that has constantly tested the boundaries of political propriety.

On another frenetic day of political exchanges, Democrats sought to engineer a fast start to their impeachment efforts as their chances of political success hinge on early momentum to keep the White House off balance.

Trump however led a ferocious fight back over the weekend, lashing out at Democrats, the media and the whistleblower as some of his top allies battled through a series of contentious appearances on Sunday talk shows.

On Sunday night, it emerged that lawyers for the whistleblower wrote to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to express ""serious concerns"" for their client.

""The events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way,"" the lawyers wrote in a letter date Saturday, September 28, before directly citing a comment by Trump last week.

On that occasion, the President said the person that gave the whistleblower the information was ""close to a spy"" and hinted at the possibility of execution for such behavior.

The lawyers noted that Trump was not referring directly to the whistleblower, but said that fact did not assuage their concerns and alleged that several unnamed parties had offered a $50,000 bounty for information on their client's identity.

""Unfortunately, we expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter,"" the lawyers wrote in a letter obtained by CNN's Pamela Brown.

The letter from the lawyers emerged after House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff Sunday said he had reached a deal to secure testimony from the whistleblower. An attorney for the whistleblower said discussions were continuing.

Trump, meanwhile, kept up his bid to discredit the whistleblower.

""I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the ""Whistleblower."" Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!"" Trump tweeted Sunday.

The President also called for Schiff to be questioned for fraud and treason.

Trump also tweeted about the ""Civil War-like fracture"" comment by Robert Jeffress, a supporter on Fox News, prompting Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger to offer a rebuke.

""I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant,"" Kinzinger tweeted.

'Little Nancy Drew novel'

The White House, which seemed caught off guard in a wild week that saw House Speaker Nancy Pelosi open the impeachment inquiry , hit back hard in a bid to discredit allegations that the President abused his power by seeking dirt from Ukraine on a potential 2020 opponent, Joe Biden.

""The President of the United States is the whistleblower,"" senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,"" he said, blasting the complaint as a ""little Nancy Drew novel.""

But Pelosi told her caucus on a conference call Sunday that they should try to be non-partisan about the impeachment process.

""This isn't about politics. It's not about partisanship. It's about patriotism,"" she said.

""The idea that this has anything to do with whether you like (Trump) or not -- forget that. That's about the election. This is about the Constitution.""

The speedy escalation of the political war was remarkable, given that it is only a week since Schiff declared Trump had ""crossed the Rubicon"" in his dealings with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats and the White House are now locked in a historic confrontation that will test the US political system to its limits and will shape the destiny of the 2020 election.

Democrats train narrow focus on Ukraine

Democrats are under pressure to produce a concise impeachment probe that keeps a tight focus on Trump's alleged wrongdoing and makes a clear case to Americans.

To that end, Pelosi has made Schiff the primary face of the investigation after a Judiciary Committee hearing with Trump's ex-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski this month turned into a farce.

Speed is important because a failure to decide whether the full House will vote on Articles of Impeachment within months could overshadow Democratic primaries when the party's candidates hope to be talking about health care and economic inequality -- issues that preoccupy voters -- rather than Trump.

Still, any sign that Democrats are rushing could play into GOP claims that they have decided to impeach the President wherever the evidence leads.

While Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict Trump in a Senate trial, Democrats hope to persuade general election voters he's unfit for office and to heap pressure on GOP Senate candidates in swing states who may not relish a vote to acquit Trump.

But the longer Trump can drag the impeachment intrigue out, the better it may be for his political fortunes.

With time, he can crank up efforts to discredit the impeachment probe with the help of the conservative media machine - a tactic that worked well in shaping perceptions of the Mueller probe. The President will also seek to change the subject -- perhaps with big ticket foreign policy goals that could bolster his argument that he's doing the people's business and should not be impeached.

The White House will also likely make expansive executive privilege claims and fight in court to frustrate Democrats and build public frustration with the impeachment saga. And the President can put claims that Democrats are trying to subvert the result of the 2016 election at the center of his rallies to fire up his loyal supporters as 2020 approaches.

Action looming on Capitol Hill

As the pace heats up in Washington, former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker — who resigned last week — plans to appear for a deposition before three House committees on Thursday.

Volker is a long-time Republican foreign policy hand who was close to late Sen. John McCain — the most prominent GOP critic of the President. This could be a wild card moment for the White House, which may seek to exert privilege over the ambassador's dealings with Ukraine on behalf of Trump.

Schiff said Sunday that he also expects the whistleblower to testify ""very soon"" following negotiations focusing partly on how to preserve his or her anonymity and security.

""We will get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,"" he said on ABC News ""This Week.""

CNN reported on Wednesday the potential testimony is dependent on the whistleblower's attorneys getting security clearances.

In the complaint, judged credible by a Trump-appointed intelligence community inspector general, the whistleblower alleged the President tried to get Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and the White House tried to cover it up.

Trump has repeatedly denied that he did anything wrong, saying his call with Zelensky was ""perfect."" He has also dismissed allegations he threatened to withhold US military aid to Ukraine if Kiev refused to investigate Biden.

Trump supporters were out in force on the Sunday talk shows.

Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, in a contentious exchange with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union"" tried to make the issue about Biden and his son Hunter who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm when his father was vice president.

""When the company that's paying that money is under investigation, guess what? Daddy comes running to the rescue. The vice president of the United States comes running in and says, 'Fire that prospector,'"" Jordan said.

JUST WATCHED Tapper to Jordan: 'It's not gymnastics. It's the facts.' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper to Jordan: 'It's not gymnastics. It's the facts.' 03:29

Tapper replied: ""That's not what happened. Sir, sir, that's not what happened,"" adding that the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and activists in Ukraine all wanted the prosecutor dismissed because he was not pursuing corruption.

There is no evidence that Biden or his son did anything wrong.

There was one note of criticism for Trump from an unexpected quarter on Sunday. Tom Bossert, who served as White House homeland security chief, faulted the President's handling of Ukraine.

""I'm deeply disturbed by it as well and this entire mess has me frustrated,"" Bossert, now an ABC contributor, told ""This Week.""

""I hope that everyone can sift through the evidence and be very careful, as I've seen a lot of rush to judgment this week. That said, it is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent.""

The frenzied nature of Sunday's exchanges reflected the fact that no one in Washington can really predict the political impact of the impeachment drama to come.

After all, conventional wisdom on the likelihood of such a process and the wisdom of political maneuvers by Trump and Pelosi shifted several times last week. The only certainty is that Washington is entering a fraught period that could make the vitriol of the last two-and-a-half years sound like a warmup."

Nevada is right next door to California, her home state. South Carolina has a large black population.

Instead, she’s at 5% in Nevada and 3% in South Carolina.

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

The New Jersey senator's announcement comes after the Democratic National Committee announced last week that candidates must meet higher donor thresholds in order to qualify for the November debates. Candidates must raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories, up from the current minimum of 130,000 donors.

""We have nearly 35,000 donors who have been helping us make this goal. We've raised $1.5 million plus,"" Booker told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We've actually already crossed the threshold to make the November debates of 165,000 unique donors. The surge and the momentum is great, but yeah, I still need help.""

Booker has already qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate , which will be moderated by CNN and The New York Times, but he has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November stage. The DNC has not yet announced the date for that debate.

It was a strategic mistake, because the evidence contradicted her claims. But it was also a terrible mistake for the country, because it cast the fairness of the 2020 presidential election into serious doubt.

Trump supporters will rally to support him at the polls — a lesson Democrats should have learned when Republicans lost the 1998 midterm elections in the midst of impeaching President Bill Clinton (who, unlike Trump, had actually committed crimes). Moreover, public support for the inquiry will collapse once the facts are known — through the media fog that is giving the misleading “whistleblower” complaint more credibility than the underlying evidence.

But Democrats hope that impeaching Trump — or even suggesting impeachment — will place a permanent cloud over his head that will make it impossible for him to win in 2020.

If they are right, Trump supporters will look at impeachment as the reason for his defeat. And the fact that Democrats have relied on a CIA source who had no direct evidence of wrongdoing in an attempt to bring down President Trump will be seared into Trump supporters’ collective memory.

The message Democrats are sending is that not only do they refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election as legitimate, but they are willing to use the intelligence community to reverse the results of that election.

In January 2017, before President-elect Trump took office, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) warned: “Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.” The CIA, and the Democrats, are delivering on that threat.

Of course, Trump had every reason to be suspicious of the intelligence community: they had spied on his campaign and his transition team, and leaked information to the media to undermine him. Outgoing Obama administration officials were hurriedly unmasking U.S. citizens caught on wiretaps, at least one of which was illegally leaked to the media. Then-FBI Director James Comey brought Trump the phony “dossier” — not to warn him, but to intimidate him, and to gather more information from the way the President-elect would react.

Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) defended the Obama administration’s spying by arguing we had to know if a presidential candidate was “compromised” by a foreign government. (Note the double standard with Biden.)

And the surveillance continued. In the early days of the administration, Trump’s telephone calls with foreign leaders — including close allies, like Australia’s prime minister — were leaked from someone in the intelligence loop. That is the likeliest reason for the White House placing the Ukraine call on a more secure system. The White House knew that the intelligence community had abused its power before and might do so again. (That suspicion was, of course, soon confirmed.)

The Democrats, the media, and rogue CIA agents are making it impossible for Trump to do his job. No foreign leader will talk to our president if he or she knows the conversation will be leaked. That is the real threat to national security, not the contents of Trump’s chitchat with Zelensky.

It is also a threat to our democracy. If Democrats succeed, many Trump supporters will lose faith in the whole system, with dangerous consequences.

That is the Pandora’s box Pelosi has opened. Only a Trump victory can close it.

(CNN) The twists, turns and characters outlined in the complaint filed by an unnamed whistleblower to the intelligence community's inspector general read like a pilot for a new television series. This however is real life and, with impeachment investigations beginning, understanding the key elements of the complaint will be critical in following the events that unfold.

While the White House continues to deny any wrongdoing, the scope of activity presented in the complaint raises many alarming issues. Here are the five main plot points to watch for as Congress takes steps to follow up on these blockbuster allegations.

1) The complaint has been corroborated

A common talking point among many supporters of President Donald Trump is that the complaint is based on second-hand information , or hearsay. And, yes, the whistleblower does note not being ""a direct witness to most of the events described."" But this point would have been taken into consideration when the ICIG reviewed whether the complaint was ""credible,"" as he was required to do under the whistleblower statute . Notably, the ICIG still concluded that the report was ""credible.""

This judgment could be questioned if it weren't for two important things. First, the day before the release of the whistleblower's complaint, the White House released a memo containing a real-time transcription of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This call is the same one referenced in Part I of the complaint. Even based on secondhand knowledge, the whistleblower's account of the call was identical in key details to what actually took place: That the President requested Ukraine to 1) investigate the activities of Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; 2) assist in efforts to link 2016 election interference with Ukraine; and 3) work with Attorney General Bill Barr and Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.

More importantly, the complaint indicates that it is based on accounts from at least six White House officials who did have consistent, first-hand knowledge of the call and other events described in the complaint. This means that there are at least a half dozen witnesses whom Congress can call to corroborate the allegations made in the complaint.

2) There appears to have been a coverup

No scandal is truly complete without a coverup, and this one appears to have it. Part II of the whistleblower's complaint alleges that the officials who witnessed the call first hand were directed by White House lawyers to move the verbatim transcript from where it would normally be stored to a separate system which is used for highly classified information and to which access is highly restricted. (This part of the complaint has been confirmed by the White House.) Because the President's call with Ukraine did not relate to a ""codeword"" operation (typically used for covert actions), it would ordinarily not meet the standards to be stored on the restricted server. The classification markings on the released transcript supports this, as it is marked at the Secret classification level, a relatively low level of classification (while not the lowest).

Importantly, the complaint indicates that officials who received the orders believed that the transcript was moved in order to conceal evidence that might be politically embarrassing to the President and the White House -- and the appendix to the complaint alleges that the systems had been misused on other occasions for the same purpose.

In addition to an attempt to conceal a possible crime or abuse of power by the President, this on its own could be a violation of an Executive Order , which prohibits ""overclassifying"" information in order to ""prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency."" Congress will undoubtedly seek to find out who gave orders to try to conceal these transcripts from further distribution and possibly seek to obtain other ""hidden"" transcripts with world leaders.

3) The State Department may have facilitated Trump's activities

The complaint indicates that at least one State Department official, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, listened in on the call between Trump and Zelensky (though the State Department has denied this to be true). In addition, Part III of the complaint states that US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker (who has since resigned), along with US Ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials on the day following Trump's call. The whistleblower received multiple readouts of these meetings, which indicated that these State Department officials advised Ukrainian officials on how to ""navigate"" the requests that Trump made to Zelensky on the phone.

If true, this would mean that officials from the State Department were not only aware of Trump (ab)using the power of his office to extract personal favors from a foreign nation, but were engaged in efforts to help bring them to fruition. The process of organizing these official meetings, as well as the readouts of what took place in them, would leave an extensive paper trail.

Three committees of Congress have already subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce all documents related to meetings with Ukraine, and Pompeo himself will likely be called to testify about them. If he complies, the public will learn more about what expectations were conveyed to Zelensky regarding his compliance with Trump's wishes. If he doesn't comply, the House can use his defiance as evidence of obstruction, which could form its own basis for an article of impeachment.

4) The Department of Justice may have ignored a clear conflict of interest

The whistleblower complaint contains only a few references to Barr -- that he was ""involved"" in Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, and that he was mentioned ""in tandem"" with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, several times (more on Giuliani, below). The primary source -- the White House memo -- substantiates this allegation, with Trump telling Zelensky to communicate with Barr on the investigations he requested. Notably, the Justice Department released a statement just after the White House transcript release went public, denying Barr made contact with the Ukrainians.

But Barr's role in this unfolding drama takes on significance after the complaint was filed. This is because once the ICIG determined that the complaint was credible, he passed the complaint on to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. At that point, Maguire was required by law to transmit the complaint, along with any additional comments he chose to provide, to Congress.

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Impeachment is nothing anyone should be cheering Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Impeachment is nothing anyone should be cheering 02:51

He didn't. Instead, Maguire took the complaint to the White House, ostensibly (based on his testimony to Congress) to inquire whether the contents were covered by executive privilege. Two things happened next. First, the White House obtained a legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, which determined that the subject matter of the complaint did not fall under the jurisdiction of the DNI, and therefore could not be brought under the whistleblower statute.

The OLC stated that the proper channel for the DNI was to present a criminal referral of the matter to the Justice Department. The DNI did so, and the Justice Department determined that the complaint required no further investigation, either as a possible violation of campaign finance laws (which prohibits soliciting any ""thing of value"" from a foreign state or person) or any other law.

Of course, Barr is ultimately in charge of both the OLC and the Criminal Division of the FBI. Since he himself is implicated in the allegations, he should have been required to recuse in any evaluation of the complaint by his agency.

Congress will likely seek to find out what role he played in either the OLC decision or the decision not to investigate, why Barr did not recuse and if he played any other role in the allegations laid out in the complaint. Congress may also choose to call the head of the OLC, Steven Engel, to explain his reasoning, and in particular why issues regarding handling of classified information would not fall under the jurisdiction of the DNI.

5) Rudy Giuliani, international man of mystery

Perhaps the most perplexing part of the whistleblower's complaint is the role of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney. According to the complaint, Giuliani reached out privately to several advisers to the Ukrainian President as, based on accounts of US officials, ""direct"" follow-up to Trump's requests in his July 25 phone call. Notably, these meetings are substantiated by public statements Giuliani made on TV and in news interviews. In addition, footnote 9 of the complaint states that Giuliani claimed to be working on gathering information to provide to the Justice Department as part of its official investigation into to ""origins"" of the Russia probe, which is currently being handled by Connecticut US Attorney John Durham, and who is also reportedly looking into Ukraine's role in the 2016 election interference. (It should be noted here that the intelligence community has unanimously concluded that Russia was behind said interference.)

Congress will no doubt want to hear directly from Giuliani about his role in all of these efforts. Giuliani has already indicated that he may invoke attorney-client privilege to refrain from testifying (because he is acting in a private, rather than official capacity, executive privilege would not apply). But this may be an uphill battle.

The crime-fraud exception states that the attorney-client privilege cannot be used as a shield for potentially illegal activity. The Supreme Court's decision in U.S. v. Nixon did not allow the President to use executive privilege to shield potentially illegal conduct in a criminal proceeding. This precedent would likely apply as strongly in the case of a private attorney-client privilege.

Even beyond that, the privilege only covers communications between Giuliani and Trump himself: Communications between Giuliani and officials either in the State Department or Justice Department would not be covered. Congress will want to find out: How closely was Giuliani working with US government officials who were aware that he was tasked with carrying out Trump's potentially illegal requests?

Given the sheer number of characters and plot lines emerging in the whistleblower saga, the American public may have a difficult time keeping up. But the only thing they have to remember is the most important question in any scandal: Who knew what, and when did they know it?

There was growing speculation by the end of August. Congressional leaders, their aides and members of key committees -- including the Appropriations, Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees -- were scrambling to figure out why money that had been appropriated by Congress months before still hadn't been disbursed. Outreach by lawmakers to key agencies left few clues other than the delay was coming from the White House and no one could pinpoint exactly what the reason was.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell got involved, reaching out to both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper as other members urged action with letters, public statements, floor speeches and staff outreach.

""I have no idea what precipitated the delay, but I was among those advocating that we needed to stick with our Ukrainian friends,"" McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said about his outreach last week.

The comment came in a week in which a redacted, whistleblower complaint was released alleging that Trump was trying to elicit dirt from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky about his political rival, Vice President Joe Biden (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son, Hunter). Earlier this month, the White House also released a transcript a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump touts the US support for Ukraine while Trump later asks Zelensky for a favor.

In more than a dozen interviews with members of Congress and aides in recent days, many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say that while they don't remember the exact timeline of when they became aware there was an issue with Ukraine funding, there was a growing sense at the end of August that Congress needed to push the administration harder when it returned from its Augusts recess to release it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN he talked to the Pentagon about the funding multiple times.

""I called the Pentagon. The Pentagon said that they were worried about the new administration, they were doing their due diligence, they were worried about corruption, they were worried about military aid. They wanted to figure out what was what. I said, 'Fine, just figure it out,' "" Graham said, adding that it wasn't unusual for President Donald Trump not to be keen on foreign aid.

""As to the President, he wants to withhold aid across the board to get people to pay more,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican and key congressional ally to Trump, arguing there is no connection between the money and the President trying to get dirt on his potential political opponents.

Trump and his supporters on Capitol Hill and at the White House have denied there was any quid pro quo . Instead, Trump's supporters have argued the delay in military funding came out of a fear the administration had about corruption in Ukraine.

Over the summer, Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had his staff making regular phone calls to the State Department while Menendez himself applied public pressure.

In a statement on August 29, Menendez said ""in willfully delaying these funds, the Trump Administration is once again trying to circumvent Congress' Constitutional prerogative of appropriating funds for U.S. government agencies. It is also undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support.""

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, who planned to travel to Ukraine in the first week of September also released a statement urging the administration to release the money.

""Everything I had heard was that this was a decision made by the President. It was his decision and it was his decision alone,"" Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CNN.

Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rob Portman of Ohio each spoke directly with the President about it as well.

Earlier in the summer, most members and aides hadn't raised a red flag on Ukraine aid. The money hadn't been sent out, but given this was an administration where key players had made no secret of how they felt about foreign aid, it wasn't particularly unusual.

The President had been open he detested how much the US government sent to countries abroad. It was a refrain of his campaign. And Mick Mulvaney, the President's acting chief of staff and OMB director, who had earned a reputation from his colleagues on the Hill as a take-no-prisoners budget slasher, had been pushing for a rescissions package throughout the summer that would have cut roughly $4 billion in foreign aid. Many members and aides assumed a holdup on Ukraine funding could have something to do with the package.

On August 22, news reports indicate Mulvaney and the administration had relented on rescissions, however. And, it was after that fight was over, members began to wonder why military aid to Ukraine still had not gone out. At the end of August, Politico reported millions in military aid to Ukraine was still being slow-walked.

A bipartisan priority

Lawmakers were struck by the fact that this was money that had already been appropriated with broad bipartisan support. Ukraine military aid was a rare, foreign policy issue that united members of both parties. Supporting the country was widely viewed on Capitol Hill as a way to deter Russian aggression, keep them at bay and secure the region. The fact that the money was being held up and without a clear explanation or briefings about a changing policy prescription in the region, bothered many.

While, it wasn't unprecedented for an administration to change course or hold back money if there was an evolving situation in a country they were aiding, it was unusual for members of the relevant committees not to be in the loop on those discussions.

""We would have expected congressional notification that in fact monies were being held, and that would have elicited from us a briefing and normally we would have gotten a briefing,"" Menendez told CNN.

He added, ""This is emblematic of this administration in so many ways.""

There were two separate lines of money being held up. There was $250 million in military aid that was appropriated to come from the Department of Defense that had yet to be dispersed and another $140 million that was supposed to come from the State Department. A Democratic Senate aide told CNN last week that the Defense Committees had been alerted by the Department of Defense that they were prepared to send off $125 million in February and then another $125 million in May.

A top Pentagon official sent a letter to Congress in May certifying Ukraine was making progress in the fight against corruption justifying the US provide Ukraine with a $250 million military assistance.

On June 18, the Pentagon announced plans to provide $250 million to Ukraine in security cooperation funds for additional training, equipment and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's armed forces.

Then, nothing, according to a congressional aide and a US official familiar with the correspondence.

""We'd been given signals twice by the administration that they were going to release the funds then nothing happened. In August we were told the OMB is holding it,"" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said. ""They were withholding these funds that had been appropriated and signed into law by the President until the last two weeks of the fiscal year. That's crazy. It hardly ever happens,""

Another Democratic aide told CNN that the State Department notified OMB of their intention to obligate the $141 million in aid to Ukraine on June 21. Typically, that process would have just been a courtesy. OMB would have had up to five days to ask questions about the process. But, instead, it was more than two months before Congress received a notice that the money was being dispersed.

State Department officials told Senate staffers in a briefing last week that the department had no objections to the money moving forward and were not aware that OMB had sat on it, according to a Senate source. But officials in the meeting pointed the finger directly at Mulvaney as the person who directed the State Department not to send out the funds.

In the beginning of September, Johnson and Murphy traveled to Ukraine. When they returned, they both talked to Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, about the need to make sure Ukraine got their money.

""I will tell you who brought it up to me was Ron Johnson,"" Durbin said. ""He came back from Ukraine and said 'we gotta get this money released.' And, I said, 'I'll look into it.' ""

Murphy would say later about his time in Ukraine that there had been ""near panic"" in the country during his trip about whether America was really committed to their relationship in part because of delayed aid.

In the meantime, more senators were catching on to the fact that the money was being held and they pointed their attention at Mulvaney. On September 3, Portman and Johnson along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Richard Blumenthal also of Connecticut -- members of the bipartisan Ukraine caucus -- sent a letter to Mulvaney demanding answers as to what was going on with the money.

""This body has long advocated for increasing the military capacity and capabilities of Ukraine — a fledgling democracy that is pro-West and pro-United States and since 2014 has been under increased military, political and economic pressure from Russia,"" the senators wrote.

In the House, the Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and the committee's top Republican, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, sent their own letter to Mulvaney two days later.

Finally, there was an opportunity to put the Trump administration on the spot.

A little-noticed committee vote

Durbin had been working on an amendment, which would hold back money to the Pentagon if the administration didn't spend military aid money for Ukraine on time. He'd been talking with one very concerned Republican about it: Lindsey Graham.

On September 12, the Senate Appropriations Committee gaveled into their Defense Appropriations markup hearing. The routine session was mired with fireworks over the President's campaign promise of a border wall between the US and Mexico, but the meeting made news for another reason.

Graham announced the Trump administration had finally released the military aid for Ukraine. There was no longer any reason for Durbin to offer his amendment.

""Why was it released? Because of your amendment,"" Graham told the committee. ""That is why it was released because I was going to vote for it ... If you are listening in Ukraine on C-SPAN, you are going to get the money.""

Graham pushed for Durbin to drop his amendment.

""We can call the Secretary of Defense at any time we want to about 2020 funds and say, 'When are you going to release the funds to the Ukraine? If you have a legitimate problem, tell us now.' If they give us the run-around, count me in on a bill that will get 90 votes,"" Graham said.

Durbin spoke anyway, flirting with the idea he'd still force the committee to vote on his amendment that would put pressure on the administration to spend Ukraine aid money in the next fiscal year or face consequences.

But, multiple Republicans also chimed in that they were concerned about the money having been withheld. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said she was ""inclined"" to vote for the amendment because ""I think it has been a problem that the money has not been released.""

Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy asked multiple times, ""Mr. Chairman I would like to ask Sen. Durbin and Sen. Murphy why they think the funds were held up. ""

Durbin responded, ""We don't know.""

Durbin withdrew the amendment, which he said at the time was an act of good faith."

But his presidential candidacy is coming of age in real life.,2019-09-30,CNN,Andrew Yang is a rock star to his supporters. Can that propel him to the presidency?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/andrew-yang-2020-presidential-campaign/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) Andrew Yang may have been born online. But his presidential candidacy is coming of age in real life.

Yang's once quixotic bid to be president -- one during which even the businessman's family and friends asked ""president of what?"" when he told them of his aspirations -- is now a full-fledged campaign, propelled by a devout following of liberal Democrats, libertarians and some disaffected Republicans who believe his unique policy positions are the perfect antidote to President Donald Trump. That following, known affectionately as the ""Yang Gang"" (and individual members as ""Yangsters""), has the businessman polling better than most of the field.

In the clearest sign of his momentum in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary, Yang announced on Wednesday that he had raised $10 million in the third quarter of 2019, a haul that dwarfs the $2.8 million he raised from April to June this year.

Yang, with his non-political background and free-wheeling style, is a unique political figure. But what makes him truly singular in the Democratic field are his rallies, which appear more like concerts than political gatherings. The stage may be devoid of instruments, but Yang's stump speech has become so familiar to his devoted following that many in the audience are acutely aware with the ebbs and flows of his remarks and come prepared for their political idol to play the hits.

Any mention of ""MATH"" -- a pseudo rallying cry for the Yang faithful that means ""Make America Think Harder"" -- elicits prolonged chants. When Yang mentions using PowerPoint during his hypothetical State of the Union, the audience chants the name of the Microsoft software. And so many questions are in the speech that members of the audience gauge their knowledge of the candidate by how quickly and easily they can shout answers back at him.

""When was the last time,"" Yang asked here in Cambridge, ""that America's life expectancy declined for three years in a row?""

The audience, a diverse but predominantly male gathering, swelled and shouted back ""Spanish flu, Spanish flu, Spanish flu,"" chanting the name of the 100 year-old pandemic.

A smiling Yang continued: ""The Spanish flu of 1918 a hundred years ago. We are back in Spanish flu territory because of suicides and drug overdoses.""

It's an odd scene, but give-and-takes like this play out regularly throughout Yang's standard stump speech, making him -- at times -- feel more like a traveling musician than a political candidate.

""It lets me know that they are hardcore Yang Gang enthusiasts, that they know the message, that they brought friends, that they might've seen me speak before in some venue and they're back again, which means that there's something very powerful drawing us together,"" Yang told CNN during an interview in Philadelphia before a rally. ""There is an element of feeling a little bit like a traveling troubadour.""

Yang, like a musician who knows their audiences would rather hear the hits, added: ""They expect certain things.""

Tom McCormick, a 39-year-old who watched Yang from the front row of the businessman's Philadelphia rally, echoed the musician sentiment.

""He's basically one of those little indie bands that no one knew about and played in a garage,"" he said. ""And now he is starting to get a little more mainstream. ... I am just happy other people are finally catching on.""

From Joe Rogan to Joe Biden

Yang, the son of immigrants from Taiwan who was born in Schenectady, New York, in 1975, is the product of some of the nation's elite schools: Phillip Exeter for high school, Brown University for his undergraduate degree and Columbia Law School for his law degree.

He wasn't deeply into politics as a student, but he ran to lead three different student organizations during his time in school. All three tries were unsuccessful.

""I'm something like 0 for 3,"" he told CNN. ""I'm hoping to be one for four. ... The one big one will be president of the United States.""

Yang briefly worked for a law firm in New York City after graduating from Columbia, but he was quickly pulled toward the world of startups in the early 2000s. He was the vice president of a health care start up from 2002 to 2005 before he became managing director -- and then CEO -- of the test-prep company Manhattan Prep.

After the company was bought in 2009, Yang started Venture for America, a non-profit that connects recent college graduates with start-ups. It was that experience that raised Yang's profile in Washington; in 2015, President Barack Obama named Yang an ambassador for global entrepreneurship.

Yang, inspired by the federal government's lack of a response to automation, may have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for president on November 6, 2017, but it wasn't until February 12, 2019, when Yang sat down for an almost two-hour long podcast with stand-up comedian and TV personality Joe Rogan, that his campaign gained a national following.

The podcast has been viewed more than 4 million times on YouTube and, more often than not, Yang rally attendees trace their knowledge of the businessman to it. A Yang aide said it was ""absolute chaos"" after Yang sat down with Rogan, with support flooding into a campaign that wasn't ready to handle the influx.

""There was before Joe Rogan and after Joe Rogan,"" Yang recalled.

It's hard for him to say exactly what initially animated people, but the candidate believes that being considered a dark horse early in the contest, especially when so many voters detest ""politics as usual,"" was a blessing.

""I think Americans like to root for the underdog,"" Yang says, looking back on the early days of his campaign, where he says he was inspired to run after an unnamed person in Washington, DC, told him no one in the federal government would adopt the kind of radical change he was advocating unless he brought a ""wave crashing down on our heads from other parts of the country.""

""And I said, 'challenge f------ accepted,'"" he bellowed to raucous applause in Cambridge.

Yang was considered a gadfly early in the Democratic primary and written off by other candidates. That has since changed, with Yang now standing on stage with the Democratic Party's top politicians, sparring with a former vice president and multiple United States senators. The businessman has turned his campaign into a growing online powerhouse: Yang's fundraising number dwarfed the $2.8 million he raised in the year's second quarter, an aide said. It would be the continuing of an upward trend for his fundraising; he raised $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2019.

And Yang's polling has followed his fundraising. A recent CNN poll found Yang at 4% among likely caucusgoers in Nevada, a survey that got him within one early state poll above 3% from qualifying for the November Democratic debate.

Still, that initial rejection from the Democratic establishment and media continues to fuel Yang, who claims he has always believed his presidential run would be successful.

""I got to say,"" he told the audience, ""I'm enjoying sticking into the people who didn't think that we were going to make it there.""

And in conversations with dozens of Yang supporters, the sense that Yang is still being written off by the political establishment is a powerful motivating force for his diehard supporters.

""The more that happens,"" said Hsiu-Lan Chang, a 68-year-old retired businesswoman who was covered in Yang buttons near the front of the candidate's Cambridge rally, ""the more the gang gets energized.""

$1,000 for everyone

Yang is seemingly in constant motion, his boundless energy apparent even in the dullest moments of campaigning. During CNN's interview with him, Yang shadow boxed around the hotel conference room, bouncing between high-backed leather chairs as his fists jabbed in front of him. The moment he hit the stage in both Boston and Philadelphia, he proudly danced, swaggering to the front of the stage with confidence.

Yang says he considers himself ""confident,"" not cocky, but it's clear he and his aides believe it would be difficult not to be self-assured after the unexpected success he has had.

A central reason to that success is the dominant issue to his campaign: The Freedom Dividend, a plan to give every American adult $1,000 a month, a universal basic income that Yang argues would alleviate a host of social ills and eradicate poverty. Yang, as a way to demonstrate its benefits, has given a Freedom Dividend to three people for months from his personal fortune. At the September debate, he announced plans to give it to 10 more people using his campaign funds

The plan has electrified Yang's supporters, who see it as the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that only a candidate like Yang could propose.

""I'm hustling from job to job to job. $1,000 a month wouldn't sustain me, but it wouldn't let me fall down, it would be a great safety net,"" said Fred King, a Yang supporter who says he lost his job this year as a cameraman to automation. ""Now, it doesn't mean I can live off of it, but I can be able to maintain and look for other work and eventually, when I find another job, I'll be in a great place.""

While Yang's universal basic income isn't the only issue motivating Yang's run -- his website is littered with hundreds of policy positions and he talks often about the impact automation will have on the country's work force -- it is the most important to the candidate, who laughed when asked if he would trade being president for instituting a universal basic income in the United States.

""Who would even need to think about that,"" he asked rhetorically. ""I'd be thrilled if we got a freedom dividend across the finish line. And, you know, I'd enjoy being in the room to see it get signed into law.""

What's next?

Yang exudes the confidence of a candidate who didn't expect to be where he is and has little to lose. He crowd-surfed at an event in September, regularly posts video of himself playing basketball and and tweeted on Wednesday, ""People who are surprised by our success to date will be really surprised by what happens next.""

And he believes it.

Yang told CNN that when he plotted his campaign in 2017, the current trajectory he is on was among the most optimistic outcomes he could perceive.

But, Yang was clear to say, he believes there's more to come: winning the presidency.

""I always believed that we'd be successful. And when some people ask me, 'Are you surprised to be here,' I'm genuinely not,"" he said. ""I thought we'd be successful... and we're going to become more successful than we are right now.""

Yang -- a happy warrior who is more adept at Twitter than many of his own followers -- has united a group of political outsiders, many of whom supported Republicans and libertarians in the past, around his message.

But, after months of success, there is a noticeable divide in Yang's movement.

His appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast is so central to his rise that it has created distinctions within Yang supporters: The so-called ""Original Gangster"" Yang Gang -- those who learned about him from Rogan or before -- and those who learned about him more recently from debates or other media appearances. People who introduce Yang often tout themselves as ""OG"" members of the Yang Gang and any time spent with a group of Yang supporters often leads to questions about how each person found out about the candidate.

Jason Sherfey, a 35-year old research professor at Boston University who was volunteering at Yang's Cambridge rally, said that distinction plays out online, too.

""I think that this is a campaign that is painting an optimistic future that could heal the country,"" he said, ""and to have been an early part of that is something that excites a lot of people.""

He added: ""It's not a huge thing, but you can tell that people are proud.""

This could be an issue for Yang. In order to have any chance of winning on 2020, Yang will have to welcome in new supporters, many of whom have never listened to Yang's appearance with Rogan. And that could create rifts with some of the candidate's most diehard supporters.

Yang dismissed the concerns by -- once again -- likening himself to a garage band that makes it big.

""I certainly love and appreciate all the early adopters of this campaign because they saw the vision when, frankly, it was really difficult for them to be able to convince others of it,"" he said. ""I don't think there's any tension between people who are very, very early and all the folks who are joining now.""

He added: ""I liken it to fans of a rock band, like Arcade Fire. Are you a little proud if you saw Arcade Fire in a little venue? Sure! But do you begrudge the fact that now other people have discovered what you love?""

""My hope,"" he said with a pause as he reflected on the rise of the Canadian indie rock band, ""is that I can replicate the rise of Arcade Fire... and go from clubs to arenas.""

The letter states, in part (original emphasis):

We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump. While you often fat check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation. We write to demand that in service to the fact, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.

(The Biden campaign itself has been known to lie: the former vice president continues to repeat the Charlottesville “very fine people” hoax after being confronted about it at the Iowa State Fair by Breitbart News, for example.)

The statement goes on to claim that Giuliani’s claims about potential corruption by Hunter Biden in Ukraine are “completely baseless.”

Giuliani serves as a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, and has been involved in investigating Hunter Biden’s overseas business interests, which he developed while his father was in office.

The former vice president pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burma Holdings, an oil and gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat at the time — a clear conflict of interest that Joe Biden has never explained.

Biden’s attempt to silence the opposition — and the media — is virtually unprecedented in the history of American politics.

Biden appears to be losing footing in Nevada, a CNN poll found.

SSRS conducted the poll, surveying 324 likely Democrat caucus-goers September 22-26, 2019. The poll shows Sanders and Biden tied for first place with 22 percent support each. Warren fell just four points behind with 18 percent support. With a margin of error of +/- 7.1 percent, the race is locked in a dead heat.

The remaining candidates fell well outside the margin of error. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who came in fourth place, only saw five percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Tom Steyer (D) with four percent support each. Andrew Yang garnered three percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) saw two percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered one percent support or less:

Eager’s trip to Ukraine last month was part of the fellowship program and included nine other House employees. The bi-partisan visit, from August 24 to August 31, was billed as a “Ukraine Study Trip,” and culminated in a meeting with former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

The dates of the pre-planned trip are instructive. Eager’s visit to Ukraine sponsored by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council began 12 days after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint about President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee reportedly reached a tentative agreement in recent days for the so-called whistleblower to testify.

The complaint surrounds Trump’s request for Ukrainian assistance in investigating possible corruption related to the Burisma company and Joe and Hunter Biden.

Also mentioned by Trump during the phone call with Zelensky are questions about CrowdStrike, the outside firm utilized to conclude that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee’s servers since the DNC would not allow the U.S. government to inspect the servers.

CrowdStrike founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council.

Eager did not immediately return Breitbart phone and email requests for comment.

The email request inquired whether Eager, during his trip sponsored by the Atlantic Council, personally held any meetings in Ukraine related to the whistle blower complaint filed about two weeks before the visit.

Besides funding from Burisma, the Atlantic Council is also financed by Google Capital, billionaire activist George Soros’s Open Society Foundations as well as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department.

As Breitbart News reported last week, Google, Soros’s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower’s complaint alleging Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 presidential race.

Schiff signed form

Schiff’s signature appears on the required post-travel disclosure form filed with the House Committee on Ethics documenting the visit to Ukraine. The form signed by Schiff says that Eager’s trip to Ukraine was paid for by the “Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.”

The form bearing Schiff’s signature (above) describes the visit thusly:

Series of meetings and visits with gov’t officials, party officials, civil society and private sector reps in Ukraine to learn about ongoing political and military issues, including conflict in the East.

The costs for Eager’s visit listed on the form are $2202.91 for transportation, $985.50 for lodging, and $630.15 for meal expenses.

Geysha Gonzalez is the Atlantic Council officer listed on the form. She is deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.

Speaking to Breitbart News, Gonzalez confirmed that Eager started his one year fellowship with the organization in January and that Eager is still a fellow.

Gonzalez said the pre-planned trip was part of the fellowship program, which also includes a full year of round tables and other educational events. She said it was not within her portfolio to comment on issues of funding from Burisma or other donors.

The itinerary of the trip shows a meeting with Poroshenko as well as discussions with local activists, politicians and residents.

Besides Eager, nine other Congressional staffers were listed as participating in the visit. Republicans were represented by Laura Detter, legislative assistant to Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), Zachery Laven, legislative assistant to Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ), Michael McCabe, legislative assistant to Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Sarah Miller, legislative assistant to Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL).

McCain adviser and dossier

The Atlantic Council’s Gonzalez is also one of eleven members of the rapid response team for the Ukrainian Election Task Force, which says it is working to expose “foreign interference in Ukraine’s democracy.”

Another member of the team is David J. Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain who served at the McCain Institute for International Leadership as senior director for human rights and democracy.

Kramer revealed in testimony that he held a meeting about the anti-Trump dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer’s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated.

BuzzFeed infamously published the Christopher Steele dossier on January 10, 2017 setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document.

The Washington Post reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it.

In a deposition taken on Dec. 13, 2017 and posted online earlier this year, Kramer revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier was being taken seriously.

In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander.

In the deposition, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry’s State Department.

Burisma and Atlantic Council

Besides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank.

Only four months ago, the company co-hosted the Council’s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference.

Burisma further co-hosted a U.S.-Ukraine Business Council event with the Council last year in Washington, DC. David Kramer of the dossier episode is a senior adviser to the Business Council.

Busirma and the Atlantic Council also signed a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma’s financial support reportedly to focus “on European and international energy security.”

Burisma advertises that it committed itself to “15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.”

Common Funding Themes

There are common threads that run through an organization repeatedly relied upon in the so-called whistleblower’s complaint about Trump and CrowdStrike.

One of several themes is financing tied to Google, whose Google Capital led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike. Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party.

CrowdStrike was mentioned by Trump in his call with Zelensky. Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, reportedly helped draft CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC’s allegedly hacked server.

On behalf of the DNC and Clinton’s campaign, Perkins Coie also paid the controversial Fusion GPS firm to produce the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

CrowdStrike founder Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia. The Council in turn is financed by Google Inc. and Burisma.

Besides Google and Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros’s Open Society Foundations as well as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department.

Google, Soros’s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower’s complaint alleging Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 presidential race.

The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the whistleblower’s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower’s own claims, as Breitbart News documented.

One key section of the so-called whistleblower’s document claims that “multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.”

This was allegedly to follow up on Trump’s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the “cases” mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower’s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.

Even though the statement was written in first person – “multiple U.S. officials told me” – it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

That footnote reads:

In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.

The so-called whistleblower’s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:

Write that Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko “also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.”

Document that Trump adviser Rudi Giuliani “had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.”

Bolster the charge that, “I also learned from a U.S. official that ‘associates’ of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.” The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, “I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.”

The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a “joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.”

BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.

The OCCRP and BuzzFeed “joint investigation” resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump’s political rivals.

The so-called whistleblower’s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.

Together with Soros’s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are “disputed.”

Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute’s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros’ Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy.

CrowdStrike and DNC servers

CrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky.

According to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people…The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

In his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not “obtain or examine” the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia.

The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI.

In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered “multiple requests at different levels,” to review the DNC’s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a “highly respected private company”—a reference to CrowdStrike—would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified.

A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC.

“The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” the official was quoted by the news media as saying.

“This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,” the official continued.

Biden, Ukraine and Burisma

Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving Burisma, the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed.

Biden publically boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t…” Biden said.

“They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, … we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

According to Page, Biden is taking a similar approach to what Trump is taking.

“Joe Biden believes in the whole adage when you’re explaining, you’re losing,” Page said. “And that’s a fact. The same thing has happened with the other controversies, which have been minor gaffes mostly. But he’s right — you don’t see Trump try to explain anything. He just keeps moving on and just throws barbs back at this accusers. That’s the approach Biden has taken.”

Co-panelist Pat Buchanan responded to Page’s assertion by noting that media will be accompanying Biden on the campaign trail as the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary approach, and question how he will avoid the issue.

“This is an old controversy,” Page replied. “Nobody has found that either he or Hunter have done anything specifically wrong. But this is like Obama’s birth certificate. Donald Trump is going to keep talking about it as if there were a ‘there’ there.

The younger Biden, who has a storied history of personal and professional issues, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the Bidens are denying any wrongdoing, even going to the extent of accusing Trump of abusing his power, the situation only underscores the shadowy nature of Hunter Biden’s professional life.

Breitbart News is providing an indepth breakdown of instances in which Hunter Biden’s business interests directly intersected with his father’s position in elective office.

1. Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor hired Hunter fresh out of law school.

Shortly after Joe Biden was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, his largest campaign contributor, the credit card issuer MBNA Corp., hired Hunter for an undisclosed role. The job raised eyebrows from ethics watchdogs since MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner designed to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations.

Clouding the picture even further was the fact that then 26-year-old Hunter Biden was a recent graduate of Yale Law School with no banking or business experience. Both father and son defended the job offer, claiming nothing improper had or would result because of the arrangement.

“Unfortunately, no matter where I went to work, some people would make an issue of it,” the younger Biden told the Delaware News Journal in November 1996 when the job was announced.

Despite his role being unknown at the time of his hiring, when Hunter Biden left the company in 1998 to join the Clinton-era Commerce Department it was as a senior vice president.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Joe Biden was championing bankruptcy reform legislation endorsed by financial interests and credit card companies such as MBNA.

2. Hunter Biden was on MBNA’s payroll while Joe Biden was writing bankruptcy reform legislation.

In the early-2000s, Hunter Biden remained on MBNA’s payroll as a consultant while his father was writing and pushing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The arrangement, which did not become public until after the law was passed, started in 2001 after Hunter Biden had left his position in the Commerce Department. Hunter Biden was paid monthly consulting fees, with some claiming they ranged upwards of $100,000, to advise the company on online banking issues.

The 2005 bankruptcy law tightened regulations to make it extremely difficult to declare bankruptcy. The law was heavily favored by MBNA and other giants in the banking and finance sectors. Many consumer protection advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have claimed the bill benefited special interests at the expense of consumers. Some have even suggested the law only served to hasten and aggravate the recession of the late 2000s.

As previously reported by the New York Times, Biden worked against many of his own fellow Democrats in Congress to ensure the final version of the bill was free of provisions opposed by companies such as MBNA.

Biden “was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month,” the Times noted.

3. Hunter Biden sought to monetize off his father’s political standing on Wall Street.

In 2006, shortly before Joe Biden assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and launched his second presidential campaign, Hunter purchased a hedge fund called Paradigm Global Advisors with his uncle, James. Although neither had a strong background in finance, James and Hunter believed they could leverage Joe Biden’s political connections to their benefit.

“Don’t worry about investors,” James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother, purportedly told Paradigm’s senior leadership upon taking over the fund, as reported by Politico. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”

Paradigm’s executives claim that James and Hunter Biden saw the hedge fund as a way to “take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money” to Joe Biden’s campaign account.

“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” James Biden allegedly told Paradigm’s staff.

As part of their effort to cash in on Joe Biden’s political influence, Hunter and James also tried to solicit labor unions to invest their pension funds with Paradigm. The duo’s main argument when pitching to unions was their access and ties to Joe Biden, who has a long record of advocating for collective bargaining.

The entire approach proved unsuccessful after a series of bad investments — including a partnership with a Ponzi scheme. James and Hunter eventually chose to strip the hedge fund of all its assets in 2010, selling them to the highest bidder before shuttering it indefinitely.

4. Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China only days after his father paid an official visit to the country.

As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden inked a multi-billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The deal, which was the first of its kind, created a private equity fund, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) to invest Chinese money overseas.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China. Schweizer said:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden is still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

5. The Obama-Biden administration helped facilitate the sale of U.S. company with insight into military technology to BHR and a Chinese state-owned defense firm.

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company.

The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.

When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”

Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.

“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley noted when launching the probe."

“The key question here that nobody seems to want to ask in the media is: What was he being paid for?” Peter Schweizer asked of Hunter Biden. “He wasn’t being paid for his expertise. What was he being paid for? And what were the Ukrainians expecting to get in return?”

Schweizer’s Secret Empires was first to uncover the details behind how Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father, then-Vice President Biden, steered $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine.

“I think when you overlay the financial payments with the fact that Joe Biden as point person on Obama administration policy to Ukraine was steering billions of dollars of Western money to Ukraine it becomes crystal clear exactly why they were paying him money,” Schweizer told Mark Levin. “They wanted access and they wanted to influence Joe Biden. And Joe Biden has been around a long time here, and he had to know exactly why his son was being paid.”

The poll shows both Biden and Warren tied for first place, earning 25 percent support each among Democrat primary voters. Sanders – who has been struggling to overtake his ideological ally, Warren, came in third place with 16 percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth with seven percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropped to fifth place with six percent support. Ten percent of respondents said they are “not sure,” and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percent when adjusted for weighting and +/- 2.9 percent for registered voters.

The September 2019 Emerson poll – taken September 21-23 – told a similar story, with Biden, Warren, and Sanders dominating the top tier with a three-point spread.

The poll shows Biden with 25 percent support and Warren and Sanders closely behind with 23 percent and 22 percent support, respectively. While Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) have dominated the top of the second tier, Andrew Yang came in fourth place, earning eight percent support, followed by Buttigieg with six percent and Harris with four percent. The remaining candidates did not crack two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, indicating a dead heat for first place among Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

The Economist/YouGov poll shows Sanders continuing to hold the edge with voters under 50 and Biden continuing to appeal to older voters:

Sanders continues to hold an advantage with voters under 50, with 28% support from that group of voters. Conversely, Biden continues to dominate the older vote with 42% support from those aged 50 or over. Warren competes with her rivals with both age groups, as she receives 23% support from those under 50 and 23% support among those 50 and over. Among voters who supported Sanders in 2016, 37% still support him, 23% now support Warren, 10% now support Biden and 9% now support Yang. In contrast, among those who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, 41% now support Biden, 22% support Warren, 14% support Sanders, and 6% support Harris.

Emerson Polling also showed the top three Democrat candidates in tight head-to-head general election matchups. It showed Warren performing the best, beating President Trump 51 percent to 49 percent. Biden beat Trump 50 percent to 49 percent, and Sanders performed the worst, losing to Trump with 49 percent to Trump’s 51 percent."

Schweizer told host Mark Levin that the former vice president’s son was being paid by Ukraine despite not having expertise in the energy sector while Joe Biden was the “point-person” on former President Barack Obama’s administration in dealing with Ukraine.

“The key question here that nobody seems to want to ask in the media is: What was he being paid for? He wasn’t being paid for his expertise. What was he being paid for? And what were the Ukrainians expecting to get in return?” Schweizer stated. “I think when you overlay the financial payments with the fact that Joe Biden as point person on Obama administration policy to Ukraine was steering billions of dollars of Western money to Ukraine it becomes crystal clear exactly why they were paying him money. They wanted access and they wanted to influence Joe Biden. And Joe Biden has been around a long time here, and he had to know exactly why his son was being paid.”

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) says he cannot tell the difference between Vice President Joe Biden’s son’s foreign business dealings and the college admissions bribery scandal.

Most recently, Biden has come under scrutiny surrounding alleged corruption when he served as vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, allegedly used his influence while serving on the board of a Ukrainian oil company, Burisma, in April 2014.

During an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Sunday, Gosar noted the similarities between Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma and the college admissions bribery scandal where 16 wealthy parents in California have been indicted for allegedly bribing their children’s way into elite universities.

LISTEN:

“People look at it and say ‘How does that work that he gets to go on his coattails and then his father does that, that’s not appropriate,'” Gosar said. “Look at all these parents that are being hauled in front of the courts that actually used bribery to get their kids in school. What’s the difference? What is the difference?”

Gosar said the allegations of corruption against Biden and his son should be investigated by the federal government.

“We should open an investigation in regards to [Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma] because the American people see politicians use their positions … you know they go in with a little bit of money and they come out wealthy as all heck,” Gosar said. “This reeks.”

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

Host Jake Tapper asked, “Do you think it’s acceptable for the child of a president or vice president to be sitting on the board of a foreign company while their parent is conducting foreign policy?”

Booker said, “Look, I have a lot of beliefs about ethics rules and the needs for our government of the United States to go far further in the rules that we have. But the fact that the Republicans right now are trying to use this and distract from the president of the United States and his own actions is to me incredible. And so, yeah, I have problems with the way things happen. I have problems with congresspeople coming in and leaving their office and walking right out the door and going to work for lobbying firms. There are a lot of things I see in Washington that need changing, and I intend to bring a whole new suite of ethics laws to the White House when I get there.”

Tapper asked, “It sounds like your suggesting that in a Booker administration the child of a president or vice president, it would not be okay for them to be joining foreign boards while the president or vice president is conducting foreign policy as required by the law. Am I hearing you incorrectly or hearing you correctly?”

Booker added, “Look, I’m watching what’s going on with the Trump family right now, and Trump properties and I just find that deeply offensive to just any kind of independent sense of what’s honorable, ethical, not to mention inconsistent with the Emoluments Clause. I just don’t think children of presidents, vice presidents during the administration should be out there doing that.”

A new book claims that Obama endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instead of Biden in 2016 because he was “just another white guy.”

“Joe, despite his many virtues, was just another white guy, one in a long line of American presidents — hardly the symbol of the Teutonic change that Obama hoped would mark his place in the history books,” wrote author Steven Levingston in a new book, according to the Daily Mail.

Levingston is the nonfiction editor of the Washington Post, and has authored books about former President John F. Kennedy. His new book, Barack and Joe: The Making of an Extraordinary Partnership is scheduled for release on October 8.

“Barack had placed his bet on Hillary, the one he believed would confirm his revolutionary stamp on American’s political culture – the first black president passing the baton to the first woman president,” he wrote.

The book notes that Obama did not endorse Biden for president in 2020 either, marking a blow to his former vice president who routinely cites Obama’s legacy on the campaign trail.

Biden was also stung by the fact that Obama was meeting with potential presidential candidates such as former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, according to Livingston.

The New York Times also reported in August that Obama told Biden, “You don’t have to do this, Joe,” referring to a conversation he had with his former vice president, and asked Biden’s aids to not let the former vice president embarrass himself.

The book also details an anecdote about Obama as a newly elected senator emailing one of his advisers, “Shoot. Me. Now.” as Biden droned on during a speech."

The interview got heated when co-Host Ed Henry asked if Trump did anything “illegal” during his call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Levin responded, “What crime was violated? It’s not illegal. The question is whether Biden did something illegal. The president didn’t do anything illegal. You know how I know? Because Nancy Pelosi’s been on every tv show and she can’t cite one section of the United States code where it’s illegal. My question is, why is Joe Biden above the law? Why is his son above the law? Where is Hunter Biden today? Where is the media? Don’t they want to know? Don’t they want to know if the leading contender for the Democrat nomination is a crook and if his son is a crook?”

Henry said, “I’m asking you are you OK with a president asking his counterpart — this is a simply yes or no —to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son? Are you OK with that?”

Levin shot back, “First of all, your question is not honest. So I don’t give yes or no.”

Henry interjected, “That’s a quote from the transcript, sir.”

Levis said, “Let me finish. You have all morning. I have two minutes. It’s not an honest question. Show me in the transcript where the president said that … nowhere.”

He continued, “The media have taken sides here and what I’m saying is this is an utterly corrupt political, partisan process. And it’s about time we had some real reporters who would try to get to the bottom of this.”

He added, “There’s going to be a huge backlash in this country one way or the other. You can’t disenfranchise 63 million people who are on to this, who have alternative forms of information. Real cover-up here. Gee, we have the letter, and we have the transcripts, and all I get are reporters trying to tell me what the transcript says as opposed to what I read with my own eyes and telling me it’s the offense of the century that the president of the United States dares to mention something that’s in the American newspapers to the Ukrainian president.”

“He doesn’t say get Biden,” Levin continued. “He doesn’t say I’m digging up dirt on Biden. He doesn’t say do me a favor and get Biden. He says, ‘Why don’t you talk to my attorney general, look into this. People have questions.’ Wow. And all the sleazy activity that’s going behind the scenes. I want to know. I want to know if Adam Schiff and his staff, working with this phony whistleblower. I want to know who the lawyers are who helped him write that complaint as I was the first to point out before. I want to know the whole activity that’s taking place in the shadows of this government to try and bring down a president of the United States.”

“Things are being done to this president that have never been done to prior presidents,” he added. “Where did they keep the transcript of the phone call? Who gives a damn! The president has a power to issue an executive privilege order. Doesn’t matter if he kept it in his pillow. He can still protect that, but he didn’t. He gave it up.”

Both the media and Wikipedia have ignored or minimized that President Trump’s biggest concern was Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election helping spark the discredited “Russiagate” investigation.

Wikipedia editors have also refused to mention in the intro that the Department of Justice concluded Trump committed no criminal wrongdoing and characterized mentions of liberal donor George Soros being involved in the controversy as “conspiracy theories” despite the proven role of organizations funded by Soros.

As media began reporting on the “whistleblower” complaint about Donald Trump’s call with Zelenskiy and other interactions with Ukraine, editors on Wikipedia began constructing an article on the topic as well. The article has seen heavy contributions from the site’s left-wing anti-Trump editors who constitute nearly all of the top ten contributors to the page. Wikipedia’s page on the “Trump-Ukraine controversy” authored by these editors presently states in the intro that the controversy is “Trump used a phone call on July 25, 2019, to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate business dealings of Joe Biden . . . and his son Hunter.”

Not included in the intro is any mention of the fact that a much larger portion of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian President was discerning what role officials in the country played in crafting the discredited narrative of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia to rig the 2016 election. Several media outlets, including CNN and MSNBC, have similarly misrepresented the transcript of the call by not mentioning that request in their coverage and claiming the “favor” he requested concerned investigating Biden instead. Biden is actually mentioned some time later with no clear connection to the “favor” request.

One reason for this detail’s exclusion from Wikipedia’s article on the controversy is its exclusion from sources deemed “reliable” on the site, though some have covered it, including sources cited in the article. However, most coverage of these facts has occurred in sources deemed “unreliable” thus preventing their inclusion. Despite sourcing being available to elaborate on Trump’s concerns about the Russia investigation’s origins, Wikipedia almost completely avoids mentioning this detail at all. In the article body, mention is made of efforts to determine whether Ukrainian officials in 2016 investigated Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort in order to help Clinton win the election, though portrayed as entirely the effort of Trump’s attorney and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.

In fact, allegations of Ukrainian officials investigating Manafort and Trump to influence the 2016 election in Clinton’s favor have been made since Ukrainian official Serhiy Leshchenko first revealed the “black ledger” purportedly detailing illicit payments Manafort received for lobbying on behalf of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. A court in Ukraine concluded last year that Leshchenko improperly revealed information about Manafort to influence the 2016 election and Fusion GPS employee Nellie Ohr testified before Congress that Leshchenko funneled information to the firm, which was hired by the DNC and Clinton campaign to conduct opposition research against Trump.

An early 2017 Politico article further detailed allegations of then-contractor for the Democratic National Committee Alexandra Chalupa seeking assistance from Ukrainian officials in investigating Trump and Manafort. Politico reported Ukrainian embassy officials were told they were coordinating an investigation with the Clinton campaign, which sought to launch Congressional hearings. The Hill’s John Solomon later quoted one official as stating Chalupa claimed the DNC wanted to paint Trump and Manafort as Russian agents so Trump could be removed from the general election ballot.

Material mentioning Solomon’s reporting on alleged collusion between Ukrainian officials and the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election was added to the Trump-Ukraine controversy page as “background” until editor “SPECIFICO” insisted on moving it to a “conspiracy theories” section. The Solomon material was subsequently removed, though editors discussed adding it back so long as Solomon’s claims were presented as conspiracy theories.

Also included in the “conspiracy theories” section are mentions of Soros-funded groups being involved, even as one was directly cited in the error–laden whistleblower complaint. The section further includes Trump’s mention of DNC-contracted cyber-security firm Crowdstrike and claims his questioning of Russian responsibility for alleged election-related hacking involved a “far-right conspiracy theory” despite liberal outlets such as The Nation publishing criticism of the allegations. Wikipedia editors previously purged sources from the article on alleged Russian interference for noting criticism of the hacking allegations from cyber-security experts.

Editors have not only sought to exclude details about the full context of the call, but to also minimize any mitigating details. While the article on the Trump-Ukraine controversy mentions a Department of Justice finding that Trump’s call did not involve any criminal violations, this has been left out of the introduction to the article with editors arguing including it would give “undue weight” to the conclusions of the highest law-enforcement body in the country.

Past actions by left-wing Wikipedia editors to spin Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation to minimize Trump’s exoneration on Russian collusion are consistent with these efforts. This included minimizing criticism regarding the integrity of the Russia investigation to the point editors have smeared outlets such as The Epoch Times, whose Spygate coverage focuses on alleged improprieties at the heart of the investigation. Such questions are also the subject of investigations by the DOJ Inspector General. A report on the FISA warrant issued against Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, which relied on opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign, is reportedly set for release in October.

Partial transcript as follows:

BRENNAN: Big week here, but I want to begin where Nancy Pelosi just left off. She lays out what she says is most problematic the sequencing.

GRAHAM: Right.

BRENNAN: The president in this call record says–

GRAHAM: Right.

BRENNAN: –“Would you do us a favor?” He brings up debunked myth about the DNC server and then he brings up the Biden family and the need for an investigation. He repeatedly lays that out. And also the aid package is mentioned.

GRAHAM: Right.

BRENNAN: You have no problem with any of this?

GRAHAM: I have zero problems with this phone call–

BRENNAN: Even with that sequencing?

GRAHAM: I just told you I have zero problems with this phone call. There is no quid pro quo here but I do have a problem with Nancy Pelosi. If you believe that Donald Trump did something to hurt this country you owe it to vote not talk about impeaching the president. The only way to open up an impeachment inquiry is to vote. We need a John Hancock moment from House Democrats. Quit hiding behind Nancy Pelosi. If you think the president did something wrong in this phone call then vote to open up an article of impeachment inquiry and a lot of House Democrats won’t because they’re afraid.

BRENNAN: Well putting that political calculus aside I want to ask you about the content though–

GRAHAM: Yea.

BRENNAN: –of this conversation.

GRAHAM:Can I tell you about this conversation?

BRENNAN: Do you think it was ethical for–

GRAHAM: Yes.

BRENNAN: –the president to bring up Joe Biden?

GRAHAM: Yes, absolutely. I think somebody ought to look at whether or not Joe Biden had the prosecutor fired in an improper way. I love Joe Biden. I don’t want to look at it. I want an inspector general somebody like Mueller. Did Biden know that his son was receiving 50,000 dollars a month from a gas company being investigated by the prosecutor–

BRENNAN: Isn’t that just–

GRAHAM: –wait a minute–

BRENNAN: –his payment–

GRAHAM: –wait a minute–

BRENNAN: –for being on the board?

GRAHAM: The–

BRENNAN: Do you have reason to believe–

GRAHAM: The board- the guys–

BRENNAN: it was anything more than that?

GRAHAM: –on a board being investigated for corruption and the guy doing the investigation is asked to be fired by Biden. I don’t know what happened. It smells to high heaven. I never said the Mueller witch hunt- the Mueller investigation was a witch hunt. I introduced legislation to protect Mueller. This seems to me like a political setup. It’s all hearsay. You can’t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistle blower didn’t hear the phone call.

BRENNAN: Right.

GRAHAM: Who told the whistleblower–

BRENNAN: — Which he says.

GRAHAM: –about the phone call and everything else?

BRENNAN: He says–

GRAHAM: Donald Trump is–

BRENNAN: –multiple White House officials were discussing it.

GRAHAM: –still an American. Every American deserves to confront their accuser. So this is a sham as far as I’m concerned. I want to know who told the whistleblower about the phone call. I want to know why they changed the rules about whistleblowers not- the hearsay rule was changed just a short period of time before the complaint was filed. The complaint sounds like a legal document who help him- who helped this guy write it or this girl write it? We’re not going to try the president of the United States based on hearsay. Every American has a right to confront their accuser.

BRENNAN: You wanted the president to release this partial call record–

GRAHAM: I did.

BRENNAN: –but you’re saying this is hearsay.The complaint on a number of fronts–

GRAHAM: –who–

BRENNAN: –is matched by

GRAHAM: –the–

BRENNAN: –the call record–

GRAHAM: –the transcript and the complaint are not matched–

GRAHAM: –now- now wait a minute–

BRENNAN: –the reference to the DNC server–

GRAHAM: –please let me talk–

BRENNAN: –the will you do–

GRAHAM: –please, please–

BRENNAN: –a favor. I’m laying out the facts here.

GRAHAM: No- no you’re not.

BRENNAN: The repeated–

GRAHAM: No, you’re making an argument that–

BENNAN: –reference to Joe Biden–

GRAHAM: Here’s the point–

BRENNAN: All of those things–

GRAHAM: Joe Biden–

BRENNAN: –are laid out here–

GRAHAM: –went to the–

BRENNAN: –the face that the attorney general was brought up.

GRAHAM: Nevermind. You know you’ve got an opinion and I got an opinion. You’ve got me on the show to tell me what- what I think. I think Mueller did a good job for the country and there was nothing there. I think this whole thing is a sham. I can’t believe we’re talking about impeaching the president based on an accusation based on hearsay. Who is this whistleblower? What bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint. What’s going on here? Why did they change the rules about a whistleblower you can use hearsay when you could not just weeks before the complaint? So I think this thing stinks and let me tell you about Republican’s – you want to know about Republicans? Republicans believe that you’re guilty just by the accusation if you’re Brett Kavanaugh it doesn’t matter. They don’t tell you when it happened and where it happened it just happened 30 years ago. If you’re Donald Trump you don’t get to confront your accuser like every other American. Republicans believe this president is being persecuted. They don’t love Donald Trump and the way he does business. They like what he does, but they believe he’s being persecuted. They believe that everybody’s out to get him and I believe as to this complaint it smells.

BRENNAN: So the acting director of national intelligence who was put in that job by the Trump administration–

GRAHAM: Yeah.

BRENNAN: –said he believed that the whistleblower was–

GRAHAM: No, he did not–

BRENNAN: acting in good faith–

GRAHAM: No, he did not. He said they couldn’t question his motives–

BRENNAN: Right–

GRAHAM: But he didn’t know if it’s true or not. So Adam Schiff read the- the- the- the transcript in a way that everybody would believe that Trump’s guilty. The DNI did not say he- he could confirm this–

BRENNAN No.

GRAHAM: He didn’t know- he didn’t have any reason to believe the- the whistleblower’s doing anything wrong. What I want to know, who told the whistleblower about the transcript? Who told the whistleblower about a phone call between the president of the United States and a foreign leader–

BRENNAN: Yeah, he–

GRAHAM: This is the third time a phone call has been compromised–

BRENNAN: Right–

GRAHAM: I’ve read the transcript. I’m fine with it, but I’m not fine with this president being impeached based on hearsay. Every American should be able to confront their accuser, including Donald Trump.

BRENNAN: But the-the whistleblower here says that multiple White House officials conveyed this to him–

GRAHAM: Who are they?

BRENNAN: And the fact–

GRAHAM: Who are they–

BRENNAN: –pattern was laid out–

GRAHAM: What- what bias do they have–

BRENNAN: To- to move on to another point–

GRAHAM: No, wait a minute. Let’s stop right there. The whistleblower says I have no direct knowledge–

BRENNAN: Right.

GRAHAM: –multiple White House officials told me this–

BRENNAN: Yes.

GRAHAM: They tell me about a phone call. There’s a disconnect. Who are these people, and what are they up to? You know, this is- Mueller wasn’t a witch hunt, but this is- Salem witch trials have more due process than this–"

The administration “hid it on a very highly sensitive, highly compartmentalized server that very few people in the U.S. government have access to in order to bury it,” she claimed on Friday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.

Rice addressed accusations by the “whistleblower,” who said President Trump wanted to hide the call because he allegedly told Zelensky he would give the Ukraine funds for its military if Kiev would investigate the Biden family’s relationship with the eastern European country.

“It’s rare that a presidential conversation would be classified to that highest level,” Rice said. “It’s not impossible. It’s very rare. Even when they are two leaders discussing classified information. Here’s a case where there was nothing classified and it was moved to the most secure, sensitive server.”

Fox News reports: “She was asked by the moderator if the Obama administration ever kept calls on a separate server. She responded by saying only if “they were legitimately in their contents classified.”

However, Breitbart News reported Thursday that the transcript did not contain any mention of “quid pro quo” that might justify the Democrat’s efforts to impeach President Trump.

The report stated:

The much-discussed phone call did not include an exchange where Trump said he would only release temporarily frozen military aid to Ukraine if Zelensky agreed to investigate the unusual and highly lucrative relationship between a Ukrainian firm and Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, Trump highlighted how Congressional Democrats communicated with Ukraine officials in the past when they asked them to investigate the president.

“The Democrats, they went down to see the president of Ukraine and they asked him for all sorts of things,” he commented, adding that the Democrats had urged the Ukraine officials not to work with Republicans and to remain in step with their party.

“U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018, urging them to cooperate with investigators in the Russia investigation and the investigation of President Donald Trump,” the report concluded.

On Saturday, the president defended himself on Twitter by stating that Zelensky said he never felt any kind of pressure during their phone conversation in July.

Appearing at the Texas Tribune’s Tribune Fest, Pelosi stated it’s more important for Congress to uphold its duty of holding the president accountable than maintaining power over the lower chamber.

“It doesn’t matter,” Pelosi replied when asked by Tribune CEO Evan Smith if she harbors any “anxiety” over the Democrats’ ability to keep the House if their impeachment inquiry goes awry.

“Our first responsibility is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” said the speaker.

“People say you have to take a political risk doing that,” she went on. “That doesn’t matter. Because we cannot have a president of the United States undermining his oath of office, his loyalty to his oath of office, undermining our national security, and undermining the integrity of our elections.”

Pelosi’s comments come after the speaker announced an impeachment inquiry this week against President Donald Trump over a telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the pair discussed U.S. military aid and the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden. The July 25th conversation was the subject of so-called “whistleblower” complaint, which according to its author, a CIA officer, is comprised entirely of second-hand knowledge of the call. Additionally, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel’s (OLC) affirmed that the Deep Stater has a bias in favor of a political rival of President Trump. Further, CBS News and Fox News report that the complaint includes inaccuracies, including the false claim charging that Ulrich Brechbuhl, the Counselor to the U.S. State Department, was on the call.

Notwithstanding, in a nod to transparency, the White House released the Trump-Zelensky call transcript on Wednesday. The complaint was published by the House Intelligence Committee the following day.

President Trump lambasted critics of the call in a pair of tweets Saturday, writing: “The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called “Whistleblower” knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong, just like Liddle’ Adam Schiff.”

“The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!” the president added."

The administration “hid it on a very highly sensitive, highly compartmentalized server that very few people in the U.S. government have access to in order to bury it,” she claimed on Friday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.

Rice addressed accusations by the “whistleblower,” who said President Trump wanted to hide the call because he allegedly told Zelensky he would give the Ukraine funds for its military if Kiev would investigate the Biden family’s relationship with the eastern European country.

“It’s rare that a presidential conversation would be classified to that highest level,” Rice said. “It’s not impossible. It’s very rare. Even when they are two leaders discussing classified information. Here’s a case where there was nothing classified and it was moved to the most secure, sensitive server.”

Fox News reports: “She was asked by the moderator if the Obama administration ever kept calls on a separate server. She responded by saying only if “they were legitimately in their contents classified.”

However, Breitbart News reported Thursday that the transcript did not contain any mention of “quid pro quo” that might justify the Democrat’s efforts to impeach President Trump.

The report stated:

McCarthy and host Scott Pelley sparred over the July 25th conversation in which President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed U.S. military aid and the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House candidate Joe Biden. Their exchange — which is the subject of a so-called “whistleblower” complaint based on a partisan CIA officer’s interpretation of news reports and second-hand information — sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry last week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has attempted to justify the probe, saying President Trump was using taxpayer money to “shake down” Zelensky — a claim that both Ukraine’s president and Trump have vehemently denied.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky, flanked by the president, told reporters at the United Nations in New York City last week.

The White House released a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call last Wednesday. Democrats — and CBS’s Pelley — accused the president of telling Zelensky that he had to perform a “favor” before Ukraine would receive defense funding. However, these operatives rip the phrase “I would like you to do us a favor” from its context — Trump asking for help getting to the bottom of what really happened in 2016 with Democrats’ emails and Russia — after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report gave little new information. The discussion of Biden comes a whole page later in the transcript — after several hundred more words on other topics.

Amash quit the Republican Party in July after announcing his support of impeachment in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on now-debunked collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.

Meanwhile, President Trump and McCarthy appear none-too-worried about the impeachment probe, suggesting it will help the Republicans in the 2020 election.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News last week. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”

“America is too great to be led by a vision so small — I’m 100 percent confident Democrats obsession with impeachment will backfire on them in 2020,” he added."

“We would appreciate any and all support US citizens can give,” Zaid tweeted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed Wednesday that the identity of the unknown “whistleblower” has a political bias in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 rivals.

The “whistleblower”— who is reported to be a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer— said in the complaint the knowledge was obtained from “White House officials” but was not firsthand knowledge, according to a Justice Department official.

Members of Congress had opinions largely along partisan lines about whether the “whistleblower” was really a true “whistleblower.”

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said in a Thursday interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow that the purported government bureaucrat not only does not meet the standard as a “whistleblower,” but is also someone with a political bias.

2020 Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a Friday CNN interview she feared for the “whistleblower’s” safety, framing the person as someone “trying to get to the truth.”"

The Washington Post unveiled a column Monday, speculating whether Pelosi could become president if President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence left office.

The writers, Robert Atkins and Adam Frankel, noted that it remains “far-fetched” that Trump and Pence could be forced from office over “abuse of power related to the administration’s dealings with Ukraine or other misdeeds.”

The Post piece arises as Democrats have moved towards an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the conversation, Trump asked Zelensky about a former Ukrainian prosecutor’s investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his shady business dealings.

Democrats have contended that this amounts to asking a foreign power to interfere with an American presidential election, while Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have said that this does not amount to a quid pro quo.

The column writers compared Democrats’ current move to impeach the president to when former Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned amidst charges of tax evasion, which left the office of the vice president temporarily vacant in 1973. At that time, if President Richard Nixon were to have resigned or been impeached, House Speaker Carl Albert (D-OK) would have assumed the presidency.

The writers contended that because Pence has appeared to be a “witness” to the president’s conversation with Zelensky, the “prospect of the House speaker’s ascension is not as remote at is seemed just a week ago.”

Atkins and Frankel said that the chaos America currently faces lies with the president’s “heedless, indulgent, and volatile leadership,” not the Democrats moving towards another investigation to oust Trump."

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) on Monday urged Republicans to “save your souls” by pulling support for President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign as the House Democrats move forward with an impeachment inquiry.

In the Washington Post, Flake writes the GOP should “obviously” not back the president in 2020, regardless of the impeachment inquiry’s outcome.

Flake, an outspoken Trump critic who resigned from Congress, admitted that opposing President Trump comes with negative political ramifications — which he succumbed to himself. The Arizona Republican, had he ran for re-election, would have faced a daunting primary fight against a more conservative challenger.

“My fellow Republicans, it is time to risk your careers in favor of your principles. Whether you believe the president deserves impeachment, you know he does not deserve reelection,” Flake wrote in his op-ed. “Trust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job. But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.”

Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have seemingly already heeded Flake’s advice. Speaking to CNN earlier this month, Romney, another staunch Trump critic, said he was “not planning on endorsing in the presidential race.”

Flake’s emergence comes as the White House is gearing up to battle a Democratic impeachment probe sparked by a partisan CIA officer that alleged — based on second-hand information — that President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the business activities of Hunter Biden, the beleaguered son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden. Last week, Zelensky dismissed the claims, telling reporters at the United Nations: “We had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me.” Last week, in a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call to show no wrongdoing occurred during the leaders’ conversation.

However, according to Flake, impeachment “now seems inevitable,” and “with what we now know, the president’s actions warrant impeachment.”

“Although Article II, Section 4 is clear about remedies for abuse of office, I have grave reservations about impeachment. I fear that, given the profound division in the country, an impeachment proceeding at such a toxic moment might actually benefit a president who thrives on chaos. Disunion is the oxygen of this presidency,” he wrote.

Meanwhile, high-profile Republicans — including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (D-OH) — have mounted a vigorous defense of President Trump’s call with Zelensky and say that both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) impeachment probe is a grave political miscalculation and the so-called “whistleblower” is nothing more than a disgruntled anti-Trumper that is out to hurt the administration.

“The left has officially lost their minds — they are so fixated on their imaginary impeachment that they are getting nothing else done,” McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News last week. “266 days in power and what have Nancy Pelosi and the Socialist Democrats accomplished? Absolutely nothing.”

“America is too great to be led by a vision so small — I’m 100 percent confident Democrats obsession with impeachment will backfire on them in 2020,” he added.

“A bureaucrat who didn’t like the president files a claim saying the president did something wrong in a call. This guy wasn’t on the call, somebody else told him about the call, so the White House does something they’ve never done before, they released the transcript, but the Democrats say we don’t care we’re going to move towards impeachment,” Jordan said of the partisan CIA officer in a heated Sunday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.

“You know why we know that because Nancy Pelosi did a press conference the day before and said she was going to move towards impeachment, the day before we even saw the transcript. It shows these folks with bound and determined to go after this president no matter what. They put the country through three years of this false Russian Trump collusion issue all the way through,” he added."

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Breitbart News exclusively on Monday evening that his committee is planning hearings soon, beginning with Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz as soon as Horowitz releases his imminent report on the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“The Horowitz report is coming soon,” Graham said Monday evening when reached by phone. “The focus of the Judiciary Committee will hear testimony from him, and follow whatever leads the report gives us about the FISA warrant and the counterintelligence investigation. So my number one goal is to hear from Horowitz and make a record of how the system got off the rails regarding the counterintelligence investigation and the FISA warrant.”

Graham said he expects Horowitz’s report to come “in a couple of weeks,” and his Judiciary Committee will be holding a hearing with the Inspector General as soon as that comes out.

“I would expect that we start with him, and see where it takes us,” Graham said of Horowitz’s expected report and forthcoming testimony.

Graham’s interview here confirming forthcoming Senate hearings on this matter comes in the wake of last week, when House Democrats formally launching an “impeachment inquiry” into President Donald Trump after a “whistleblower” complaint alleged he had committed wrongdoing in a phone call with Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky. The Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry before they had the transcript of the call or the whistleblower complaint, and neither—since publicly released—have lived up to their hype.

This also comes after the years-long investigation by Mueller failed to uncover any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russian efforts to interfere in the election or to show that Trump obstructed justice. The Mueller probe, and Democrats’ efforts to investigate the Russia hoax in Congress, fell flat in the summer, leaving Democrats without much to go after Trump on heading into the August recess.

Then this whistleblower complaint came to light in the last few weeks, with Democrats in Congress reportedly becoming aware of it over the August recess. Things eventually hit a fever pitch last week when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rushed forward with impeachment proceedings into Trump before obtaining the evidence.

Horowitz, the DOJ’s Inspector General, has for months been looking into the origins of the Russia collusion investigation. Some have suggested that the Democrats perhaps moved forward with this impeachment proceeding against Trump as part of a bid to pre-empt whatever comes out in the soon-to-be-published report and eventual further actions.

As for the newer whistleblower element of things, for now, Graham said the Senate Intelligence Committee is where the whistleblower complaint angle on this lies, although he did say other committees may get involved soon.

“As for the whistleblower complaint, it’s been referred to the Intel Committee,” Graham said. “I will expect that they will look at the complaint. Whether or not other committees get involved, it’s too early to tell, because we’ve got to wait to see what Intel does.”

When it comes to conversations Attorney General Bill Barr has had with foreign leaders about their countries’ roles in the creation of the counterintelligence operation, Graham said he sees absolutely nothing wrong with that.

“As for Barr talking to foreign governments as to what role they may have played in the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign—very appropriate,” Graham said. “I find it laughable that the Democrats are objecting to the Attorney General trying to find out what role foreign entities played in the counterintelligence investigation when Democratic senators wrote a letter to the Ukrainian government threatening to cut off aid if they didn’t cooperate with Mueller.”

Graham added, too, in response to the latest story in the New York Times that Trump brought up the Mueller probe origins with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, that the president did nothing wrong, and this is completely normal despite what Democrats say.

“I am glad that Australia is cooperating with Barr and [Connecticut’s U.S. Attorney John] Durham and trying to find out if any laws were broken regarding the counterintelligence investigation,” Graham said. “Again, Democrats are okay with talking to foreign governments if it’s to get Trump. But they’re not okay with talking to foreign governments when it comes to whether or not Trump was treated unfairly.”

“Now, all of a sudden, it would be bad for Barr to talk to somebody or the president wanting his attorney general to find out what happened? Give me a break,” Graham added.

What’s more, Graham expects the forthcoming Horowitz hearings to be just the beginning.

“Start with Horowitz. Start with Horowitz,” Graham said. “I think what the system needs to do is look at the other side like Mueller looked at Trump. We had Mueller do a two-year probe of the Trump campaign and how it operated. Now it’s time to figure out how the system got so far off the rails.”

“So, if Horowitz tells us that the system got off the rails with the warrant and counterintelligence investigation, then it will be up to Durham to look at criminality and it will be up to Congress to make sure it never happens again,” Graham continued.

Graham said he thinks that former President Barack Obama himself was likely at the top of all of this, and was aware of it all.

“You don’t think Obama knew about the counterintelligence investigation?” Graham said. “I’ll bet you everything I own that Obama knew about the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.”

He also said that he is unsure what comes of this, with particular regard to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden—who was working for Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma despite having no experience in the field. The then-Vice President infamously told the Ukrainians to fire the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma when Hunter Biden was working for the company, or he would hold up significant U.S. aid to Ukraine. Biden bragged at a public event later that Ukraine gave in to his demands.

“As to the Bidens, where this goes I don’t know, but stay tuned,” Graham said."

The federal government states: “Under the modern practice, an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges against the officer in question.”

In a blog in the Hill, even an anti-Trump commentator explained Pelosi’s unorthodox approach:

Ordinarily, such a resolution would be dropped in the hopper and referred to the Rules Committee, then reported to the House floor for a vote. Both the 1973 and 1998, the Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquiries were authorized by House adoption of such resolutions. The press revealed that the leadership briefly considered establishing a special select committee to conduct the inquiry, but that was quickly dashed by caucus liberals defending Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler’s (D-N.Y.) right to preside over the impeachment proceedings. Instead, Pelosi directed the six House committees currently investigating President Trump and his administration “to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.”

The press is also advancing Pelosi’s strategy, including USA Today, which published a story on Sunday headlined, “Nancy Pelosi has put the Trump impeachment inquiry on a fast track. Here’s the plan, timeline, and key players.”

The article begins with a false claim that Trump “abused his power by pushing Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.”

USA Today reported on “the plan:”

Some lawmakers want the House to decide whether to file articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, a timeline that could avoid having the issue spill over into the 2020 election year. The plan for now, according to lawmakers, is to prioritize the Ukraine investigation, which is being led by the House Intelligence Committee, while other panels wrap up their probes and send their best cases to the House Judiciary Committee. Then lawmakers will decide whether to bring forward articles of impeachment, which would require a full House vote. If it passes, Trump would be impeached – sort of like a criminal indictment.

USA Today notes that if the impeachment articles are approved, the Senate would hold a trial, and then a 2/3 vote would be needed “for Trump to be removed from office.”

But as Reuters reported, removal is far from certain:

The Senate now has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with the Democrats. Conviction and removal of a president would require 67 votes. So, for Trump to be removed from office via impeachment, at least 20 Republicans and all the Democrats and independents would have to vote against him. The Republican majority in the Senate could vote to immediately dismiss the charges against Trump without considering evidence. No president has ever been removed as a direct result of impeachment.

USA Today said despite Congress being on a two-week recess “things are moving rapidly,” including setting up depositions of state department officials with ties to Ukraine.

And while some have criticized Congress taking a break, it is part of “the plan,” according to Democrats.

“I think it’s very important that members go home to their constituents and explain what they are thinking,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in the USA Today report. “This is a matter of grave importance and the American people need to understand what is occurring.”

“It’s also a chance to possibly sway public opinion on the issue as voters remain fairly split on impeaching Trump,” USA Today reported.

Partial transcript as follows:

STEPHANOPOULOS: We begin with President Trump’s first homeland security advisor, Tom Bossert, whose core responsibilities included election security and helping coordinate the U.S. government response to Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Tom, thank you for joining us this morning. You know, the whistleblower’s complaint says that White House officials were deeply disturbed by the president phone call with Zelensky. What was your reaction?

BOSSERT: Yes, I’m deeply disturbed by it as well and this entire mess has me frustrated, George. Thanks for having me on. You and I both lived through the impeachment of President Clinton and saw how frustrating and dividing it can be, and I’ve just spent a week overseas, and I’ll tell you, the whole world is watching this. The removal of a president is a — is a big and serious deal. But the removal of a president in not only a democracy but the biggest democracy in the world is really a weighty matter and I hope that everyone can sift through the evidence and be very careful, as I’ve seen a lot of rush to judgment this week. That said, it is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent.

But it looks to me like the other matter that’s far from proven is whether he was doing anything to abuse his power and withhold aid in order to solicit such a thing. That seems to be far from proven and it’s going to be the focus of I think our Congress for the next year.

STEPHANOPOULOS: That’s the investigation. Let’s walk through some of what’s in the whistleblower’s complaint. And I want to show it up on the screen. It starts with President Zelensky saying “I’d really like to thank the president for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from United States for defense purposes.” And then the president says, “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say Crowdstrike…I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on. The whole situation.”

Now, what the president is referring to there is a debunked conspiracy theory that somehow Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic emails in 2016 and that Ukraine might have the DNC server or Hillary’s emails. The details are both convoluted and false. And during your time in the White House, you explained that to the president, right?

BOSSERT: I did. It’s not only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked. You know, I — I don’t want to be glib about this matter, but last year retired former senator Judd Gregg wrote a piece in The Hill Magazine, saying the three ways or the five ways to impeach oneself. And the third way was to hire Rudy Giuliani. And at this point I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.

And for clarity here, George, let me just again repeat that it has no validity. United States government reached its conclusion on attributing to Russia the DNC hack in 2016 before it even communicated it to the FBI, long before the FBI ever knocked on the door at the DNC. So a server inside the DNC was not relevant to our determination to the attribution. It was made up front and beforehand. And so while servers can be important in some of the investigations that followed, it has nothing to do with the U.S. government’s attribution of Russia of the DNC hack.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yet the president keeps on repeating it. You — you — you condemned Mayor Giuliani for continuing to tell the president (inaudible). How do you explain why the president brings this up in a meeting with the Ukrainian president? That is a form of pressure, isn’t it?

BOSSERT: Well, I didn’t see, like others have seen, pressure in this call. I understand why people are interpreting it that way. But I’ve spent a lot of time with this president, and I can easily see other reasons for why this president might have delayed the aide to Ukraine and those Javelin missiles. In fact, as you know, President Obama considered this deeply and decided not to provide lethal military support. President Trump and I and others spent quite a bit of time talking about this. In fact, in the call itself, although there are a lot of other reasons, he alludes to one that’s kind of quintessentially Donald Trump, and that is his frustration that Angela Merkel and the German nation member of NATO is doing nothing to help Ukraine, and — and he expressed some lamentation over that fact. So why he delayed is the key question. And — and — and you know, important, George, to remind everyone that he did ultimately provide the money and the Javelin missiles…

STEPHANOPOULOS: And that’s your…

BOSSERT: …but this was the second time that he considered doing it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And that’s your judgment on whether or not it would be an impeachable offense. But on its face, requesting the Ukrainian president to investigate this debunk conspiracy theory and to investigate a political rival, that’s not appropriate for a president, is it?

BOSSERT: The DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go. They have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated in our — in our discourse. On the other matter, I honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation. I believe he and his legal team have been looking into this, probably even prior to Joe Biden announcing that he would run for president. And they’re continuing to focus on everything they can, in their belief — understandably, in this case — that the president was wrongly accused of colluding with Russia the first time around. But George, if he continues to focus on that white whale, it’s going to bring him down. Enough. The investigation’s over. There was no evidence of collusion. He’s won and he should take that victory and move forward."

Biden entered the race in the spring as the clear front-runner in the Democratic field. Since that time he has appeared in three debates with a varying cast of Democratic characters. His performances in those debates have ranged from ""not bad"" to ""oh man."" Biden's best debate was the last one in Houston, in which he started quite strong and authoritative but faded badly as the debate wore on -- culminating with an answer on reparations for slavery that was cringingly bad.

Despite mediocre-ish performances, Biden has, generally speaking, not suffered greatly in the media after-action reports. (I, myself, named Biden a ""winner"" in the last debate , noting that he did just enough to keep the wolves from his door and benefited greatly from the widely panned attack on his age/competence from Julián Castro.)

But even between the last debate and the one tonight -- 8 p.m. on CNN! -- things have changed for Biden -- and make a so-so debate performance harder to write off.

First, this is the FOURTH Democratic debate. If the first one or two were Biden getting his sea legs after years of not being a candidate for national office, then he has to have moved beyond that feeling-out period by now. If he hasn't, it's evidence that something bigger is wrong.

Corruption fighter?

Trump argues he has an absolute right to urge other countries to investigate ""corruption."" But, of course, it is his focus on Biden -- without any actual evidence of corruption -- that is the flashpoint.

Four historians delivered a verdict: ""In the history of American foreign relations, delivered a verdict: ""In the history of American foreign relations, we are unaware of any prior case — in 230 years — of a president asking a foreign leader to intervene in American domestic politics ,"" something Trump has now done multiple times.

John Dean: Protect the whistleblower

The Watergate scandal blew wide open in 1973 when White House counsel John Dean revealed Nixon's effort to cover up the facts.

After a stream of death threats against Dean, the Justice Department provided US marshals to protect him for 18 months. ""Those marshals were consummate professionals, and I am sure their successors are, too,"" Dean wrote for CNN Opinion.

Now the same needs to be done for the whistleblower in the Trump impeachment inquiry, he said: ""It is difficult to imagine a more important federal witness than one who testifies in an impeachment proceeding. That witness needs to be protected.

Elie Honig, ""Trump has claimed that the person or people who gave information to the whistleblower are 'close to a spy' and longingly noted that 'in the old days ... we used to handle it a little differently than we do now' -- referring, not so obliquely, to executing disloyal spies.

Jill Filipovic. The now former officer, Amber Guyger, was convicted and sentenced last week to 10 years in prison.

The now former officer, Amber Guyger, was convicted and sentenced last week to 10 years in prison. "" What this guilty verdict may at least show is there are some lines even white police officers can't cross when killing unarmed black people,"" Filipovic wrote.

Many Americans were taken by the embrace of forgiveness Jean's 18-year-old brother, Brandt Jean, offered Guyger during her sentencing. ""I get why others only felt inspiration, and were moved by such a selfless act,"" wrote Issac Bailey. ""The faith that moved Brandt Jean to say those words is the faith that convinces me to hold onto the idea of redemption for all, even those who do dastardly things.""

Even so, he added, "" Brandt Jean and his family had every right to be angry. But had he expressed that black anger, many in white America would not be celebrating him today. Heck, had Brandt Jean decided to silently, peacefully kneel in the middle of the courtroom instead of hugging Guyger, I have no doubt that much of white America would have written him off as just another ungrateful, unpatriotic black man-- the way they have Kaepernick.""

Wally Conron, the breeder of the first named Labradoodle, would like to take back what he now calls a ""gimmick,"" wrote Alexandra Horowitz. He worries that he ""created a monster."" And he's on to something, she noted.

But the point applies more broadly: "" The rise of pedigree dog-breeding prioritized looks over function and the result are the genetic problems we see in so many breeds today. "" The standards used to breed bulldogs for example, ""led to a dog with such a short nose that they have severe problems breathing in the heat, or with even the least amount of exercise — which includes 'walking.'""

""Interestingly, by cross-breeding dogs, as with the oodles, the genetic problems purebred dogs face can be eliminated, if one continues cross-breeding (as usually does not happen in oodle breeding).

The former vice president's plan, unveiled Tuesday morning, also aims to cut student loan obligations -- particularly for those with public service jobs.

The plan formalizes measures that Biden has frequently discussed on the campaign trail. It builds on the existing higher education framework, rather than including further-reaching proposals such as four years of free college and wiping away all student debt.

It stops short of the four years of free college tuition proposed by Biden's two leading rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont

It's also a step away from what Biden called for in 2015, as he announced he would not run for president in 2016. He said then that ""we need to commit to 16 years of free public education for all our children"" and the nation should ""make the same commitment to a college education today that we made to a high school education 100 years ago."" Instead, it builds on the two-year proposal that Biden and former President Barack Obama had advocated for while in office.

The gun control plan that Biden's campaign unveiled on Wednesday also aims to tackle urban gun violence with an eight-year, $900 million program that would go toward efforts to combat shootings in 40 cities with the highest rates of gun violence.

It would eliminate legal protections that prevent gun manufacturers from being held liable for how their products are used.

And it includes a series of measures backed by nearly all of the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential primary contenders. Among them: closing loopholes in background checks before gun purchases, banning the sale of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, and allowing states to implement ""red flag"" laws.

The former vice president's package of gun proposals stops short of the high-profile plans other Democratic presidential candidates have offered, such as former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's call for mandatory buybacks of assault-style rifles and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's proposed national gun registry.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump arrives for a news conference in New York on September 25. It was held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and it came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

President Donald Trump's July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine is at the center of a whistleblower scandal that prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch a formal impeachment investigation.

According to a transcript of the call released by the White House, Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a former vice president and potential 2020 political rival. He also asked Ukraine to investigate Biden's son, Hunter. The essence of Trump's argument is that Joe Biden was improperly trying to help Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the country's prosecutor general.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.

CNN confirmed that Trump ordered a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before the call with Zelensky. Trump said he withheld the aid because he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share and that the delay wasn't related to the investigation request.

Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong in his phone call with Zelensky, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever."" He has called the impeachment inquiry ""the greatest hoax,"" lashing out at Democrats, the media and the anonymous whistleblower who submitted a complaint to an intelligence inspector general."

Volker appeared Thursday before three committees that are investigating allegations made by a whistleblower that the President sought Ukraine's assistance digging up dirt on his political rival and then the White House tried to cover it up.

In the interview, Volker told lawmakers that the Ukrainian government had a lot of questions about why the military aid was being held up and he did not have a good explanation, according to the sources describing the testimony.

Volker also testified that the Ukrainian government was concerned that a meeting with the Ukrainians and Trump was being put on hold but did not understand the reason.

JUST WATCHED Sources: Special envoy to Ukraine resigns Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sources: Special envoy to Ukraine resigns 00:56

The meeting was important to Zelensky, who pushed to come to Washington on the July 25 call. According to the rough transcript, the President responds first that he will have Attorney General William Barr and Rudy Giuliani get in touch and then says: ""Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.""

But the meeting never happened. A planned meeting in Poland ended up being scrubbed because the President stayed in the United States to deal with a hurricane and he sent Vice President Mike Pence in his place.

Volker also told congressional investigators that he raised concerns with Giuliani about using former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko as a source for information about the Bidens and other controversies, warning that Lutsenko was not credible.

Volker, who resigned one day after he was named in the release of the whistleblower report last week alleging Trump was using the power of the presidency to ask Ukraine to investigate the Bidens for political gain in the 2020 election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

Republicans, however, said that Volker's testimony did not provide any evidence to support the Democrats' claims of impeachment.

Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, told reporters after leaving the interview that ""not one thing"" Volker said ""aligns with the Democratic impeachment narrative.""

""I do not believe that Volker's testimony advanced Schiff's impeachment agenda,"" Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican and House Intelligence Committee member, said in a statement after attending Wednesday's interview. ""It is deeply unfortunate and regrettable that Schiff's show trial investigation has clearly affected Volker's ability to advance U.S. interests with Ukraine.""

A rough transcript of Turmp's July phone call with Zelensky shows he repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son, Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

The allegations prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announce that she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers.

The complaint labels Giuliani as a ""central figure"" in the controversy.

US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges that US officials believed Giuliani was a conduit for messages between the President and officials in Kyiv and that he was at the helm of a problematic ""circumvention of national security decision making processes.""

Speaking to CNN last week, Giuliani said he has ""no knowledge of any of that crap"" in the complaint.

Ahead of his deposition Thursday, dozens of pages of documents were delivered to the House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees on behalf of Volker, two sources familiar tell CNN.

Analysts previously told CNN that Volker's testimony could be damaging to the President and his allies.

Volker is seen as ""a well-respected straight shooter who is likely to testify in ways that will damage other Trump allies,"" wrote Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, in an emailed analysis. ""It's possible others, including key administration members like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr would also be forced out.""

This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."

""Giuliani has been involved up to his neck in this entire mess,"" the senator said. ""He has an obligation to testify under oath so he can be asked questions so this can come to light.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said this week he wants to convene hearings to examine allegations of corruption in Ukraine.

""Given the House of Representatives' behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,"" said Graham in a tweet. ""Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.""

The Times' report, citing two people briefed on the matter, comes as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry centered on Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by issuing a subpoena to the White House and a documents request to Vice President Mike Pence

The second official is one of the people interviewed by Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson in his efforts to confirm the initial complaint, one of the people told the Times. It is unclear whether Atkinson mentioned the second official's potential complaint in his closed-door briefing on Friday with lawmakers explaining how he corroborated the initial whistleblower's complaint, which alleged that Trump had pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden -- Trump's potential Democratic rival -- and Biden's son Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing in Ukraine by Joe or Hunter Biden.

A more direct complaint could draw greater scrutiny to Trump's attacks discrediting the original complaint as composed of secondhand information. The President has said he wants to meet not only the whistleblower , ""who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the 'Whistleblower.' ""

Last week, Trump also described whoever had provided the whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian President as ""close to a spy, "" adding that in the old days spies were dealt with differently."

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Lawyers for the whistleblower sent a letter to the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Saturday outlining ""serious"" safety concerns for their client as Trump continues to take aim at the person.

""The purpose of this letter is to formally notify you of serious concerns we have regarding our client's personal safety,"" the letter says, adding that recent comments by Trump are reason for ""heightened"" concern."

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73.

(CNN) Finally, the Trump administration is taking seriously the pervasive problem of children of the powerful and politically connected trading on their family names for money and access.

Too bad they're not turning the lens on themselves.

In a move that is stunningly insincere and hypocritical even by President Donald Trump's standards, the latest strategy to deflect from the impeachment inquiry against him seems to be to point a finger at Hunter Biden. Biden spoke with ABC over the weekend and conceded ""poor judgment"" in sitting on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, a position for which he seems to have had few qualifications and for which he was paid $50,000 a month. Ronna McDaniel, the GOP chairwoman who is Mitt Romney's niece, accused Biden of ""obvious nepotism,"" tweeting , without irony, ""If that's not the swamp, I don't know what is!""

Donald Trump Jr. had the audacity to tweet a quote from the interview, when Biden said that he of course had to disclose his ties to the then-Vice President. As Trump Jr. inelegantly rendered the quote , ""I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happen in my life that if my name wasn't Biden.""

Again, this was tweeted as something of a gotcha from ... Donald Trump Jr.

By all reasonable and reliable accounts, Hunter Biden did not break the law . The obsession on the right and among the Trump family over Biden's role in Ukraine has nothing to do with ethics and everything to do with targeting a political opponent and attempting to redirect scrutiny from the president himself. We should all be spending far less time on Biden and far more time on the man who currently sits in the Oval Office, flanked by his incompetent and unqualified children.

JUST WATCHED Biden: Family won't be part of any foreign operation, period Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden: Family won't be part of any foreign operation, period 01:35

But that doesn't mean we should shrug off the background story here, which is that family members of politicians, and politicians themselves, have too much latitude to trade on their names and connections. Hunter Biden didn't break the law, but his story is an opportune moment to point out that the law is too loose on this question. Ethics rules should absolutely be tightened so that family members of politicians cannot profit from those connections. And in a saner society, we would make it harder for politicians themselves to profit.

But far less flagrant and extreme profiting should also be curtailed ""among politicians"" — for example, going from Congress into a plum private sector job, where it's implied that one's political connections will be commercially advantageous. An astonishing number of former federal government employees and staffers get hired to lobby in the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, among others (there are more than 7,000 congressional staffers in what Open Secrets calls the ""revolving door"").

Trump is right about one thing: There is a Washington swamp. What's shocking is the degree to which his family has jumped in with both feet. The Trump clan has gone far beyond even normal self-dealing — that is, you get rich after you leave office — and are explicitly profiting during his presidency, while having the nerve to accuse others of nepotism.

JUST WATCHED Trump in 2006: 'I like nepotism' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump in 2006: 'I like nepotism' 00:58

The entire Trump presidency is an ethical wasteland. It's far beyond time that there were consequences — and they should certainly come for the Trump children and the president himself before they're visited on Hunter Biden.

Just a few of the many examples:

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a special adviser to the president, retains millions in various investments and holdings. A company he co-founded has allegedly profited handsomely from secretive foreign funding.

Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser, is the subject of an ethics complaint that she violated federal conflicts of interest laws. She managed to secure 16 new trademarks for her products from China, while her father was engaged in trade talks with the nation. The list of ethical violations and conflicts of interest goes on and on

There are worrying signs that Trump's business interests, not the country's, are dictating his foreign policy decisions: Trump has pulled US troops from northern Syria at the request of Turkey — a nation where he stands to make as much as $1 million a year from the Trump Tower Istanbul.

JUST WATCHED China approves trademarks for Ivanka Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China approves trademarks for Ivanka Trump 02:24

Plus, there is the simple fact that Ivanka and Jared, who have absolutely no qualifications for their adviser roles and no previous political experience, are in the White House at all. There is no more obvious example of nepotism than the fact that the Trump administration defends their hiring by claiming that federal anti-nepotism laws just don't apply to them.

The one potential upside to the Trump style of slash-and-burn politics is that it threatens to expose the whole elite scam of using political access for personal enrichment. Right now, impeachment is the word of the day. But once this absolute abomination of a presidency is over, we need to recalibrate our ethics rules and enshrine stricter ones into law.

Children of elected officials should not be able to profit from their names. Elected officials themselves shouldn't be able to profit, as the president is, from their private businesses while in office. We should even consider a several-year bar after leaving office to employment in private sector jobs with potential conflicts of interest for civil servants.

This administration is the swampiest in living memory. But getting Trump out of office won't clean it up nor will making an inapt example of Hunter Biden fix the fundamental and widespread problem. Only the boring, tedious and necessary work of implementing and enforcing stricter ethical rules for politicians will do that."

The intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, acknowledged an indication of possible political bias in his assessment of the complaint but made clear that it did not change his overall conclusion that it appeared to be credible.

""Further although the ICIG's preliminary reviewed identified some indicia of bias of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate, such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible' particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review,"" Atkinson wrote.

Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, responded to this story on Twitter by saying, ""We won't comment on identifying info but if true, give me a break! Bias? Seriously? Most ppl are.""

A week after the source spoke to CNN, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, another attorney for the whistleblower, acknowledged that the indicia could possibly also include that the whistleblower as a government employee came ""into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials -- not as candidates."" They said that the whistleblower ""has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign or party.""

The documents, which were obtained by CNN, include claims against the Bidens that formed the basis of President Donald Trump's accusations in his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as accusations against former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled earlier this year and whom Trump also criticized in the call. In addition, the packet contains internal State Department emails from officials discussing articles critical of Yovanovitch, calling some of it a ""fake narrative.""

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Giuliani told CNN on Wednesday evening that some of the documents provided to Congress by the State Department's inspector general had originated with him. Giuliani gave the documents to the White House, which then passed them to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Pompeo gave the documents to a subordinate, who provided them to the legal counsel at the State Department, the source said. The documents were ultimately given to the inspector general.

Giuliani said that in late March, he had ""routed"" what he called an ""outline"" of allegations against Biden, as well as Yovanovitch, to Pompeo's office. He said he also had sent details of his interviews from earlier in the year with the incumbent and former top prosecutors in Ukraine, who helped provide him with the information in his outline.

Giuliani said he received a phone call shortly thereafter from Pompeo, who told Giuliani he would be referring the documents for investigation.

""They told me they were going to investigate it,"" Giuliani told CNN.

State Department Inspector General Steve Linick told Congress that the department's office of legal counsel had provided the documents to him in May. A State Department spokesperson confirmed that the materials had been provided to the inspector general ""for his review and for such action as the inspector general deemed appropriate.""

The inspector general provided them to the FBI, and the FBI did not object to the documents being released to Congress, which could suggest the FBI is not actively investigating the matter.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, was the lone lawmaker who attended Wednesday's briefing. He told reporters afterward that it felt like a ""completely irrelevant distraction.""

""It's essentially a packet of propaganda and disinformation spreading conspiracy theories,"" Raskin said.

State Department inspector general Steve Linick enters a briefing with lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon.

New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the documents ""appear to contain long-debunked theories and false statements about the former US Ambassador to Ukraine and one of President Trump's political opponents.""

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a joint statement that the briefing and documents ""raise troubling questions about apparent efforts inside and outside the Trump Administration to target specific officials,"" including Biden's son and Yovanovitch.

But a Republican source said that Democrats appeared to be frustrated that the inspector general was injecting these accusations of wrongdoing from Biden and his son back into the bloodstream as the Democrats have sought to put the focus on the President's handling of the Ukraine situation.

The bizarre briefing from the State Department inspector general came after he caused a stir on Capitol Hill by requesting an urgent meeting one day earlier to share the documents.

Linick on Tuesday asked to meet with congressional staff from eight House and Senate committees to discuss and provide documents from State's acting legal adviser related to Ukraine, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The sudden briefing request from the State Department inspector general adds a new layer of intrigue to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry over allegations that Trump sought help from Ukraine's government to interfere in the 2020 elections.

Linick's request was sent to Congress on Tuesday after Pompeo pushed back on Democrats' demands to interview State Department officials as part of the impeachment investigation. Pompeo accused the committees of ""intimidating and bullying"" the officials by calling them for depositions, not giving them sufficient time to prepare and not allowing administration lawyers to attend.

The House Democratic chairmen shot back later Tuesday that it was Pompeo who was intimidating the State Department witnesses, charging that any attempt to prevent them from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

""We are deeply concerned about Secretary Pompeo's effort now to potentially interfere with witnesses whose testimony is needed before our committee, many of whom are mentioned in the whistleblower complaint,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said at a news conference Wednesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Emails and notes about Ukrainian ambassador

The first set of notes in the packet appears to be the ones Giuliani provided to the State Department, as the allegations are consistent with the narrative he has put forward about the Bidens and Yovanovitch.

The packet also includes internal State Department emails discussing Yovanovitch. Career officials undertook a concerted effort to shield the then-ambassador to Ukraine from conspiracies peddled by conservative media outlets beginning in March.

Acting Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker and George Kent, a State Department official who oversees Ukraine policy and was previously the deputy chief of mission in Kyiv, sought to provide counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl and Undersecretary for Political Affairs David Hale with facts to counter the conspiratorial narratives being pushed about the career diplomat.

On March 31, Reeker forwarded a list of ""fake news driven smear out of Ukraine"" and counter-examples to Brechbuhl, writing: ""It's a good summary of the story lines being peddled in the this, with a good balance of facts.""

""Reading through helps with context,"" Reeker added. Not long after, he followed up with another email of US coverage on Ukraine to Brechbuhl, highlighting a particular paragraph as an example that ""captures the basic fake narrative.""

""(The) assumption that (Yovanovitch) is some kind of 'liberal outpost ... leading a political struggle' really is without merit or validation,"" he wrote.

In an email from March 27, for example, Kent calls the ""do not prosecute"" list that then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko claimed was given to him by Yovanovitch ""complete poppycock."" Kent suggested taking a similar approach to the US Embassy in Moscow ""if (they) wanted to push back hard(er),"" writing, ""I know US Embassy Moscow has in the past derided fake letters by circling in red all the misspellings and grammar mistakes and reposting it.""

In early May, the State Department confirmed that Yovanovitch would leave her post at the end of the month -- months earlier than expected.

Brechbuhl was mentioned in the whistleblower complaint that was filed with the intelligence community inspector general alleging that the President was seeking campaign help from the Ukrainian President and the White House sought to cover it up, and both Brechbuhl and Kent have been scheduled for depositions with the House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry.

Ukraine depositions begin Thursday

Linick briefed Democratic and Republican staff in a secure setting Wednesday, from the three committees leading the impeachment investigation — House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight — as well as the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Intelligence, Foreign Relations, Homeland Security and Appropriations Committees.

The State Department inspector general has already been investigating allegations of ""improper personnel practices in the office of the Secretary,"" though he has yet to release the findings the probe. Linick testified in July that the report -- the second of two inquiries into retaliation at the Department -- was expected to be sent to the Department in August, and he declined to discuss the findings in that hearing. Months later, that report still has not been published.

Linick appeared on Capitol Hill one day before the House panels will begin holding depositions of current and former State officials, despite Pompeo's call for the State employees not to attend.

The committees will interview former US special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker on Thursday. Volker, who was named in the whistleblower complaint about Ukraine, resigned last week and is no longer a State Department employee.

Next week, the former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who is still a State Department employee, is scheduled to appear on Friday, according to an aide, after an agreement was reached between the committees and her counsel. The committees have also scheduled depositions with three other State Department officials next week, although it's not yet been confirmed that they will appear.

The depositions come as the House is swiftly moving to investigate following a whistleblower complaint released last week involving Trump's contacts with Ukraine that alleges that Trump attempted to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election and the White House tried to cover it up.

A rough transcript of the President's July 25 call with Zelensky shows Trump urged him to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.

In addition to the depositions, the committees are ramping up their investigation with subpoenas. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings announced Wednesday he plans to issue a subpoena to the White House on Friday if the White House will not voluntarily provide a host of documents related to the President's call and the holding up of foreign aid money to Ukraine. The House Intelligence Committee on Monday issued a subpoena to the President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has been pushing the Biden investigation, while the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week sent a subpoena to the State Department for documents.

Giuliani tweeted Wednesday that he was threatening to ""seek redress against Congress and individual members"" over attempting to remove the President on ""deliberately falsified charges.""

The President, meanwhile, has been on a Twitter barrage of his own, attacking Pelosi, Schiff and Democrats for moving forward with their impeachment inquiry.

""He should be forced to resign from Congress, Adam Schiff, he's a lowlife,"" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Finland's President on Wednesday, adding that Schiff took a ""perfect"" conversation and ""realized he couldn't read it to Congress"" because it was so nice.

This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."

Trump's presidency is threatened by the secrets revealed by a whistleblower inside the national security community who reported that the President was seeking foreign help to get dirt on his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The whistleblower's complaint drew attention to the now-infamous call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.

As a record released by the White House shows, Trump used the call to ask the Ukrainian government to investigate two conspiracy theories for which there is no evidence. The first holds that Ukraine and not Russia waged an information war on America's 2016 election. The second suggests that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden were involved in some sort of wrongdoing related to Ukraine's energy industry.

Couched in the words ""do us a favor,"" Trump's requests followed the administration's halt of the transfer of about $400 million in aid scheduled to help Ukraine defend against a Russian-backed armed rebellion in its east. In a classic display of Trumpspeak, the President told Zelensky, ""there's a lot of talk"" about Biden and he hoped Ukraine would help Attorney General William Barr's probe into it."

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

Our nation has always aspired to place the interests of our democratic purpose over the interests of markets. Silicon Valley should be no exception."

Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

""All the President's Men"" were immortalized in the classic scandal-pic starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. As Trump faces his impeachment cliffhanger , he's got his own crew of Washington heavies fighting to keep his presidency alive. Here's a brief guide:

Attorney General William Barr

Ever since joining the administration in February, Bill Bar has served as a kind of high-level legal bodyguard for Trump. From shielding Trump from the Mueller report fallout to being detailed to deal with the Ukrainian government, Barr's conduct has raised concerns that the wall between the White House and the once-independent Justice Department is falling.

Instead of personal ambition, Barr seems motivated by his view of an all-powerful presidency. There's a reason the President loves him.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

As a congressman, Pompeo tormented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. Now this poacher turned gamekeeper is trying to stop Congress from holding the current administration to account by withholding information.

Pompeo, who was on the much-scrutinized July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine's President, has perfected the art of keeping the President happy. His higher political aims mean he's keen to please Trump's base, too.

Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani

The hero of 9/11 is supposedly Trump's personal lawyer. But his incessant cable news hits are not from any courtroom manual. Rudy Giuliani openly crusaded for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, and met a government official from Kiev in Spain. Critics wonder whether his freelancing over Ukraine has led the President into a dangerous place.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham

Once a disciple of late Sen. John McCain (who despised Trump) Lindsey Graham is now the President's golf buddy and most vigorous defender. Twenty years ago as a congressman, he helped run the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton, and his defense of Trump has enemies branding him a hypocrite. But Graham knows his role likely means he will be spared a primary challenger next year in his fervently pro-Trump home state.

The controversy stems from a whistleblower's recent allegations that President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this year to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his family, and that the White House attempted to cover up the conversation.

Perry was one of what one official called the ""three amigos"" leading US relations with the country, meeting at least three times with Zelensky.

In an interview with CBN News on Friday , Perry said, ""as God is my witness,"" that neither Joe and Hunter Biden's name came up.

""I never heard, and I talked to the President about this, I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador -- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name -- not the former vice president, not his son ever mentioned.""

The businessman, Reza Zarrab, had ties to top Turkish government officials, who had pushed the US to drop charges that Zarrab had violated US sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. He was a client of Giuliani's.

During the White House meeting, the President invited Giuliani and Michael Mukasey, the former attorney general, to make their pitch to Tillerson, the source says.

After the meeting Tillerson mentioned the discussion to then-chief of staff John Kelly, who was not in the meeting, noting that it was a deal he could not support.

The episode is another reflection of Trump attempting to use his office to influence ongoing Justice Department proceedings. And news of it comes as his relationships to both Giuliani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan come under scrutiny.

Giuliani suggested the swap of Zarrab for an American pastor held by Turkey, Andrew Brunson. Asked by the President whether the deal was one he could support, Tillerson said he couldn't intervene, citing the ongoing Justice Department court case.

The President asked Tillerson if the deal was something Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, could do. Tillerson responded that Sessions would have to contend with the fact it was an ongoing case headed for trial. He also told the President that it would be bad policy because it could put other Americans in danger, raising the prospect more hostages could be used as leverage for similar deals.

Mukasey, who was working alongside Giuliani to represent Zarrab, told the President it was an arrangement he could order as president, since it was within his power. Trump told Tillerson and Giuliani to see if they could work out an arrangement.

Tillerson said after he could not support it.

Giuliani pursued the possible deal directly with Tillerson after the Oval Office meeting and was rebuffed, the source said. Giuliani and Mukasey also made a similar pitch to Justice Department officials, who objected, according to sources briefed on those discussions.

Mukasey, reached Thursday, said he wouldn't discuss the White House meeting and declined comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Tillerson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Giuliani initially denied the episode to Bloomberg, but later, he told the outlet it was possible that it was true.

""Suppose I did talk to Trump about it -- so what? I was a private lawyer at the time,"" Giuliani told Bloomberg. ""Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe at some point I dropped his name in a conversation. Or maybe one of his people talked to him about it because I was trying to do a prisoner swap.""

The revelation comes as Democrats probe Trump's ties with Giuliani, who played a central role in efforts to secure dirt on Joe Biden from Ukraine. Trump's own phone call with Ukraine's President asking him to investigate Biden is central to ongoing impeachment efforts.

Meanwhile, Trump's relationship to Erodgan has gained renewed attention after he spoke with the authoritarian leader over the weekend and abruptly announced that US troops would withdraw from northern Syria, clearing the way for a Turkish incursion.

Since leaving the State Department in 2018, Tillerson has spoken out about Trump's habit of asking him to do things unaware that such actions would violate the law.

""When the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it.' And I'd have to say to him, 'Well Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law,' "" he said during a fundraiser in December.

Tillerson said Trump would get ""really frustrated"" when told his requests would be illegal."

Trump has offered scant indication he is turning his focus to governing, despite his lawyers writing in a letter to Democrats that ""he remains focused on fulfilling his promises to the American people.""

Instead, the President has spent hours tweeting about the impeachment and lighting up the phone lines of his allies on Capitol Hill -- including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , to whom he's stressed the importance of Republican unity.

In private, Trump is increasingly leaning on the Republican leader in the Senate. In a return to the President's panicked behavior during the height of the Mueller investigation, Trump is calling McConnell as often as three times a day, according to a person familiar with the conversations.

McConnell has told a small number of Republicans about the President's calls.

""This story, based on a single anonymous source, is categorically false. Leader McConnell never said anything like this,"" Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said.

Trump has been lashing out at GOP senators he sees as disloyal, according to the person familiar with the conversations, telling McConnell he will amplify attacks on those Republicans who criticize him.

McConnell faces his own dilemma of having to preserve the Republican majority in the Senate, while also placating an erratic President who demands nothing short of total loyalty. That will become harder as more details about Trump's dealings with Ukraine trickle out.

Trump has already demonstrated his willingness to go after Republican defectors. After Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said it was ""wrong and appalling"" for Trump to suggest Ukraine and China investigate Joe Biden, Trump unloaded, calling Romney a ""pompous ass"" and suggesting Romney himself be impeached.

Trump has also been mistrustful of Republicans who are reticent to defend him publicly, often lamenting that Democrats are much better at staying in line with their party heads than his own.

Refusing to cooperate

JUST WATCHED Trump predicts his impeachment fight will go to Supreme Court Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump predicts his impeachment fight will go to Supreme Court 04:20

A letter from White House lawyers on Tuesday made clear Trump plans to wage war on the impeachment effort, refusing to cooperate with what it described as an illegitimate effort to reverse the 2016 election. An announcement that Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman, was joining Trump's outside legal team was a signal of the growing recognition the President will require additional help combating the impeachment threat.

Trump had initially been resistant to the suggestion that he hire additional attorneys, believing he was well positioned to combat Democrats as they advanced their impeachment probe without outside help. But after a lengthy meeting with Gowdy in the Oval Office, and much wheedling from Gowdy's allies, the President was convinced he needed an aggressive fighter, such as the former House Oversight Committee chairman who led the Benghazi probe.

Trump's confidants had urged him for weeks to find another voice who could represent him on television, warning that his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was doing too much damage.

Trump's focus on the impeachment issue is plain, even as his allies encourage him to train his attention on other issues. On Wednesday, as former Vice President Joe Biden came out in favor of impeachment, Trump had responded on Twitter before Biden's speech had even concluded. And speaking in the Roosevelt Room, Trump went off-script to link a regulatory announcement to his ongoing predicament.

""No American should ever face such persecution from their own government,"" Trump said, reading from a script, before looking up from his paper: ""Except, perhaps, your President.""

Internal strife

JUST WATCHED Biden calls for Trump impeachment for first time Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden calls for Trump impeachment for first time 02:40

Internal disputes, long rife in Trump's West Wing, have also heightened the sense of disorder at Trump's approach to impeachment. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is seen by many aides as leading the impeachment strategy efforts. A source close to the President's impeachment team said Kushner is playing a ""growing role"" in how the White House handles the response, though other officials said much of the response will be left to ""Jay and Trey,"" a reference to Gowdy and Jay Sekulow, members of the outside legal team.

Others say the only real point person is Trump himself, who has tweeted furiously on the subject for the past three days.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, has remained largely under the radar as the impeachment proceedings unfold. But Gowdy's hiring is evidence that Mulvaney -- who is close friends with his former House colleague and advocated on Gowdy's behalf -- also has some leeway in overseeing the strategy.

In an effort to channel some of Trump's frustrations, campaign aides have scheduled a spate of campaign rallies over the next week, including one in Minnesota on Thursday and in Louisiana on Friday. Trump announced the Louisiana rally on Twitter as his campaign was still confirming the venue. They believe Trump's anger at Democrats and arguments against impeachment will be amplified when delivered before a receptive audience.

Yet that dynamic is partly what concerns many of Trump's allies, who worry the President's obvious fixation on the impeachment matter is causing him to lash out in unhelpful and erratic ways.

In private, Trump has vacillated between telling confidantes the impeachment effort will benefit him politically to complaining it will stain his legacy. As Trump reflexively reacts to each development, many Republican lawmakers and others who the White House relies upon to defend the President have gone silent.

Others have expressed concern that Trump isn't taking the impeachment inquiry seriously enough, even as polls increasingly show Americans support it.

""I believe it's a mortal threat to the presidency. He should treat it that way,"" said Chris Ruddy, a friend of Trump's and the CEO of Newsmax, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour . ""The number of people saying the President should be impeached is increasing. Not significantly, but moving in a bad direction for the President. I think it should be treated very seriously.""

'All bulls***'

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Trump and Nixon similarities getting ridiculous Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Trump and Nixon similarities getting ridiculous 02:53

A Trump ally who spoke with the President recently said Trump's view on impeachment is ""it's all bulls***"" and he believes he and his GOP allies are well positioned to fight back politically. Trump was ""praising the (Republican National Committee) targeting those Trump-district Democrats,"" the source said. ""He seemed in good spirits.""

The RNC is targeting roughly 60 Democrats with a ""stop the madness"" campaign through paid media and earned media, including conducting press conferences, crashing town halls and holding demonstrations.

McConnell has said little publicly about impeachment since the inquiry began. He admitted last week in an interview with CNBC that he would ""have no choice"" but to take up a trial if the House voted to impeach Trump -- a point he's made to Trump in their phone conversations, according to one person with knowledge of the situation.

But on strategy, McConnell's said nothing more to the Republican conference, which has been in recess for two weeks. That, say multiple people with knowledge, reflects McConnell's ""watch and wait"" approach to all controversies, including impeachment.

While at home on recess the past two weeks, many Senate Republicans have stayed quiet on the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. But some have already laid out messaging that could gain steam once everyone returns next week, including admitting that while Trump's call with Ukraine was perhaps inappropriate, it does not rise to impeachable conduct.

Sondland's text message was sent to the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who raised concerns in a text to Sondland about the US withholding nearly $400 million of US military and security aid. This text message exchange has become a major focal point of the impeachment inquiry into the President.

Sondland is expected to testify to Congress that he has no knowledge of whether Trump was telling him the truth at the time, the Post reports. ""It's only true that the President said it, not that it was the truth,"" the person familiar with Sondland's planned testimony, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic matters, told the Post.

The congressional testimony by Sondland , a key witness within the State Department and to the President's action in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, could prove damaging to the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, the Post reports. Sondland intends to testify to the House under subpoena Thursday, according to his lawyers.

Sondland is a Trump donor and hotelier who has been EU ambassador since 2018. He exchanged messages with former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and a senior US diplomat in Ukraine about setting up the call between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump. He also exchanged messages about whether foreign aid was being withheld while Trump and Giuliani pushed for Ukraine to open an investigation into business activity by the son of one of the President's 2020 Democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden."

Rather than traveling to Warsaw, Poland, last month to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump decided to stay home to track the damage from Hurricane Dorian. In his place he sent Pence, whose face-to-face meeting with Zelensky now puts him at the heart of events that led to the impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives.

Trump isn't making it easy for Pence to distance himself, even suggesting that the details of Pence's phone calls and conversations with Zelensky should be released.

""I think you should ask for Vice President Pence's conversation, because he had a couple conversations also,"" Trump told reporters last week after the release of the White House transcript of his own July 25 call with Zelensky.

On Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that Trump has involved Pence on multiple fronts in his interaction with Ukraine.

Pence did not mention to Zelensky the President's unfounded allegations against Joe Biden in regard to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the situation. ""There was no reason to bring up Biden,"" the person says.

Pence aides maintain that when he went to Warsaw he was unaware of the Biden allegations being made by the President's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. But one of the vice president's top aides had listened in on the call the President had with Ukraine's leader, according to a source familiar with the matter, confirming a report in The Washington Post.

Instead, according to one of the sources, the vice president spoke broadly about corruption in Ukraine and received assurances from Zelensky that he would crack down on it. Pence took that message back to Trump and helped convince him to release the aid to Ukraine, according to three senior administration officials. That, along with pressure from Congress, was a key factor in Trump's decision to finally support the release of $391 million to Ukraine after a months-long delay on the money, these sources say.

""The President consistently raised concerns about corruption and the lack of burden sharing by European partners, so having run on an anti-corruption campaign, Zelensky was receptive to those messages,"" said Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff. ""The vice president reported back to the President after the meeting and the aid was released.""

""We do not comment on conversations between the President and the vice president,"" Short said.

Pence frustrated

Recent conversations with a person close to the matter reveal a deep level of anxiety inside the vice president's office. Pence advisers are frustrated with how the White House has handled the fallout from the Ukraine disclosures, including bringing the vice president into the mess. An additional Pence adviser tells CNN, ""It's a challenging environment,"" in response to the controversies and scandals the vice president has had to dodge, most recently Ukraine.

There is also concern within Pence's team over his standing with Trump.

Publicly Trump has consistently praised the vice president, insisting Pence will be his running mate next year, yet privately he is more circumspect. One person close to Trump says he is cagey when it comes to whether he will keep Pence on the ticket, always cautious not to tip his hand one way or another.

One Pence adviser pushed back on that, telling CNN that privately Trump has asked Pence to stay on the ticket.

Regardless, the challenge for Pence, as it's always been, is balancing the need to appear loyal to Trump with staying clear of the President's countless controversies. The plan to protect him, according to sources close to the vice president, is to get him on the road. On Wednesday Pence traveled to Arizona, where he attended events in Tucson and Scottsdale alongside Republican Sen. Martha McSally.

This strategy is largely in keeping with the traveling envoy role Pence has inhabited for much of the past year. During the spring and summer, he was busy flying around the country to talk up the administration's North American trade deal, the USMCA. From March through August, Pence attended 26 separate events, from CEO roundtables to Midwestern factories.

Interviews over the past several months with more than 15 sources shed light on what was always a forced union between Pence and the President.

Pence remains a crucial link for Trump to evangelicals, a segment of the Republican base he will need in 2020. Yet temperamentally, the careful and scrupulous vice president couldn't be more different from a commander in chief who prefers to make decisions on the fly.

""Whenever the vice president does anything with foreign leaders, he is totally buttoned up -- prepared note cards, legal (advisers) present,"" a source familiar with the matter said. ""He has always been squeaky clean,"" the source added, drawing a contrast with Trump's more freewheeling style on the calls.

Beyond their political relationship, Trump and Pence have little in common. Pence, hardly a scratch golfer, has only recently taken up the game Trump loves. While Trump frequently starts his day turning on cable news and firing up his Twitter feed, Pence begins each morning reading his Bible.

In his 2019 book ""Let Me Finish,"" former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie describes brokering the first meeting between the men at the governor's mansion in Indianapolis shortly before the Indiana primary in March 2016. At the end of their meeting, Pence surprised Trump by asking the small group to join hands and pray.

""Does he do that all the time?"" Trump asked Christie afterward. When Christie told him yes, the New Jersey Republican says, Trump responded with one word: ""Interesting.""

A devoted deputy

As the midterm election returns came in on the night of November 6, 2018, Trump began asking people, ""Do you think Pence is good for me?""

While Trump didn't overtly criticize Pence that night, it was clear that the President was wondering what Pence contributes to his coalition. A close ally of Trump's stressed to him that Pence's steady presence and even keel made him the perfect running mate and vice president. The ally likened Pence to ""a sommelier who doesn't drink.""

Trump seems to have listened, jokingly asking in his post-election news conference the next day if Pence would be his running mate in 2020. Pence stood up and wordlessly agreed to do so.

""Thank you, OK, good,"" Trump said.

For a President who values personal loyalty above all, Pence has been nothing if not publicly and privately devoted to Trump. He has not spoken out to counter or undercut Trump -- not following the President's comments after Charlottesville, not during Trump's attacks on members of his Cabinet and not when Trump criticized Paul Ryan, one of Pence's closest friends from his time in Congress.

One source who once worked in the White House with the vice president says the guiding principle for Pence is unwavering fealty, in recognition that he would not be in power without Trump. Pence's model is George H.W. Bush, who loyally served alongside Ronald Reagan without any daylight between the two former rivals. The source says that if Pence has disagreements with Trump, he shares them privately.

Short, Pence's chief of staff, told CNN late last year that the vice president has avoided pushing forward his own pet projects or issues. ""He would never say, 'Here's my agenda and here's how it fits in.' He's going to support the Trump agenda,"" said Short.

Moreover, Pence has taken on tasks that might be less interesting to Trump, such as international trips and leading the charge to create the Space Force division at the Pentagon. The idea, from the vice president's perspective, is to do whatever he can to endear himself to Trump.

A key to evangelicals

Most endearing -- or at least the most valuable -- to the President may be Pence's direct link to the GOP's social conservative wing. As a House member, Pence was active in a congressional Bible study and cultivated relationships with the politically active evangelical network in the nation's capital. People in that network say Pence is a key

""I found Mike Pence to be one of the like-minded and one of the most reliable people that I could work with in the Congress,"" said Dr. Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary who was the longtime head of the public policy office of the Southern Baptist Convention. ""He cared about the things that I as a Southern Baptist and the majority of Southern Baptists cared about.""

Pence's record and reputation have continually prompted questions of how a devout Christian could continue supporting a President accused of having multiple extramarital affairs. Trump has denied having affairs with his accusers. Even those who have worked closely with Pence for years say he and Karen Pence are buttoned up on their true feelings about Trump's moral failings.

One clue comes from Jane Mayer of the New Yorker, who reported in October 2017 that Pence sent a letter to Trump just after the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape a month before Election Day 2016. Pence told the Republican nominee that he and his wife were offended by Trump's comments on the tape and wanted to reassess Pence's placement on the ticket.

However serious Pence was at that moment, those concerns appeared to have been allayed shortly thereafter. Publicly, Pence went on to say he was ""grateful that [Trump] expressed remorse"" for the comments on the video, and he remained on the ticket.

Pence's future in the air

If the President keeps Pence on the ticket through 2020, as expected, it will be for the political utility he provides Trump. He's already resumed the role of top Trump campaign surrogate as the 2020 reelection effort ramps up, working to woo the traditional groups like donors and trade groups to the Keep America Great cause.

What remains Pence's competitive advantage is his long-standing connections with the broader conservative movement, which remains an integral part of the Republican coalition. Pence is a particularly important bridge to the politically active evangelical community, that network of activists and donors that has prioritized issues like abortion, religious freedom and judicial nominations.

""I would say that it's a wonderful thing to have someone of Mike Pence's caliber and integrity as vice president of the United States,"" said Tim Goeglein, a White House official under George W. Bush and a vice president at Focus on the Family. ""It's a very good and very helpful thing that we can express our views to someone who shares our views on things like human life and on issues of judges and the Supreme Court and other issues of that nature.""

Goeglein, who has known Pence for 25 years, said the vice president has been one of the most important champions for evangelicals in Washington in years. ""He's someone we know and someone who we trust,"" Goeglein said.

A member of the Trump campaign's evangelical advisory board in 2016, Richard Land recalled being asked that summer what his first piece of advice for the Republican candidate would be. Without hesitation, Land answered, ""Pick Mike Pence.""

""It was the first thing that popped into my mind, because I could think of nothing which could more assure evangelicals that they were going to have a seat at the table in the Trump administration than making Mike Pence his vice president,"" Land told CNN.

Neither Goeglein nor Land put much stock in the idea that Trump might replace Pence, though the latter says he fears doing so could hurt the President among evangelical voters. ""That would be a problem,"" said Land. ""I think it might depress [turnout] some.""

That might be enough reason for Trump to keep Pence around, but Pence offers one more critical benefit to the President: his willingness to completely submit himself to Trump and his agenda.

""He's very loyal to the President,"" said Pence's close friend, former Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. ""He's always had a kind of orientation to authority.""

(CNN) Congress threw down the gauntlet Friday when it subpoenaed the White House for a broad set of documents relating to President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

And today the Trump administration blocked a US ambassador from testifying to Congress in the Ukraine probe. The parties now are careening towards a Supreme Court showdown that could redefine the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government. And the outcome could rival in historical significance the 1974 decision that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

The new House subpoena calls for essentially every White House document relating to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump laid it on the table: ""I would like you to do us a favor though..."" And the subpoena requires production of some documents stored on a highly sensitive electronic system where the transcript of that July 25 call was kept "" lock[ed] down .""

This reportedly includes similar conversations with other foreign leaders. Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein compared these documents to the infamous White House tapes that led to Nixon's resignation.

Do not expect the White House to comply with the subpoena. Ever since Trump announced his ""we're fighting all the subpoenas"" strategy, his administration has held the line and defied congressional subpoenas. If anything, expect the White House to dig in even deeper now that its own most sensitive -- and potentially damaging -- information is at stake.

If the White House stonewalls, Congress can seek enforcement of the subpoena in court. Given the enormity of the stakes, Congress could try to get the case quickly to the Supreme Court under a rarely-invoked rule permitting direct review if the case ""is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice and to require immediate determination in this Court.""

A legal dispute over the House's new subpoena seems destined for an all-in legal battle that will echo the monumental 1974 ruling , which required the White House to provide the Nixon tapes to the special prosecutor. The Nixon Court, by unanimous decision -- including three justices who had been appointed by Nixon (a fourth, future Chief Justice William Rehnquist, recused himself) -- ruled that while executive privilege existed, it did not extend to shielding Nixon from turning over the incriminating tapes. Nixon resigned just over two weeks later.

I see only two ways a decision on the Trump subpoena might come out differently. First, the Nixon Court held that executive privilege is not a general shield against criminal exposure but rather was intended primarily ""to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets."" So the court could find that the subpoena is at least partly invalid for that reason. But Congress might respond that Trump's efforts to dig up dirt on political enemies does not meet that description. Further, the White House itself already has voluntarily disclosed the summary transcript of the July 25 call, so how sensitive could it be?

Second, the Supreme Court's composition is entirely different today than in 1974. Five of the nine current Justices are Republican nominees with staunch conservative credentials -- including two Trump appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- though Chief Justice John Roberts has shown increasing signs of ideological independence and unpredictability.

If the case winds up in the Supreme Court, the future of the Trump presidency could hang in the balance. While Congress arguably already has enough to impeach -- the July 25 summary transcript, a damning series of recently-released texts between State Department officials and evidence of the White House effort to hide records of the call -- a decision enforcing the subpoena could open the floodgates, enabling Congress to discover the depth and breadth of the Ukraine scandal, and perhaps other similar incidents as well.

As much as Trump has defied traditional political expectations, it is difficult to imagine him surviving that.

Now, your questions:

Keith (Texas): The White House argues that the US House must hold a full vote before this is a valid impeachment inquiry. Is that right, and shouldn't House Republicans have the ability to subpoena materials and make their own arguments?

It its letter to House Democrats on Tuesday, the White House served notice of its blanket rejection of all Congressional subpoenas and information requests relating to the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Essentially, the letter memorializes under formal legal cover Trump's prior vow to ""(fight) all of the subpoenas.""

The White House's primary objection is that the full House has not voted to open an impeachment inquiry, rendering the inquiry -- as announced at a news conference by Pelosi, without any formal House action -- ""constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process."" The White House argues that the House has not established ""even the most basic protections demanded by due process under the Constitution and by fundamental fairness,"" including the ability for Trump's legal team to cross-examine witnesses and to subpoena its own evidence.

Article I of the Constitution broadly grants the House the ""sole power of impeachment."" There is nothing in the Constitution, statute or prior judicial decision to indicate that a vote of the full House is required to start an impeachment inquiry. However, the full House did formally vote to initiate impeachment proceedings against both Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.

The White House appears to have two primary strategic goals. First, the White House demands several procedural protections (or, depending on perspective, privileges) including the ability to subpoena its own witnesses and evidence. In the Nixon and Clinton cases, the House did grant subpoena power to the minority party, subject to override by majority vote of the investigating committee.

Second, the White House likely aims to force vulnerable Democrats in closely contested districts to vote either for an impeachment inquiry (and risk alienating voters opposed to impeachment) or against it (and risk alienating base Democratic voters and independents who favor impeachment).

Pelosi has signaled little interest in holding a formal vote. This is a calculated risk. On one hand, if the House does vote and approves the inquiry, Pelosi eliminates one of the White House's primary legal objections to House subpoenas. (There is little risk of Pelosi holding a vote and losing; as Speaker, she almost certainly would only take that step if she knew she had enough votes to carry the motion). On the other hand, a formal vote could enable Republicans to extract concessions including the subpoena power, as in the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings.

Even if the House does vote to open a formal inquiry, do not expect the White House to suddenly start complying with House subpoenas. Nowhere in its letter does the White House so promise. And given the White House's well-established pattern of obstructionism, I'd expect it simply to turn to another basis to fight House subpoenas -- executive privilege or absolute immunity , for example. So, while a full House vote would defeat one of the White House's primary objections, Congressional investigators still would have to overcome other obstacles to obtain evidence from the Executive Branch.

Gary (New York): Who serves as the prosecutor in a Senate impeachment trial?

If the House impeaches President Trump, then it will appoint a team of House ""managers "" to present the case for impeachment in the Senate trial. During the 1999 Senate impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, the Republican-controlled House appointed a team of 13 representatives to serve as managers and present the case against Clinton. I'd expect the current House to include former prosecutors Adam Schiff Ted Lieu and Eric Swalwell, among others, on its team.

The President would appoint a team of lawyers to defend him. Those lawyers can come from anywhere, including private practice. Clinton chose a team of high-powered attorneys -- including White House counsel and private lawyers.

The 100 Senators then serve essentially as a jury, with a ⅔ vote -- 67 votes out of 100 -- required to convict and remove the subject from office.

Dave (Virginia): What is Trump's culpability for the cover-up (moving documents to a separate server) if he did not know or direct that to happen? Would the parties that did move the records have potential criminal liability?

If Trump did not know about or direct the movement of records of the July 25 Ukraine phone call to a separate electronic system, then he is not criminally liable. Even if an illegal action is taken to benefit or protect a particular person, that person cannot be charged unless he participated in the conduct in some way.

Anybody who did participate in the movement of records to the separate system could face liability for obstruction of justice or evidence tampering , but it would depend on the person's knowledge and intent. If, for example, an administrative assistant was instructed to physically move the records, but knew nothing about what the documents were or why they were being moved, that person would not be criminally liable. But if a White House staffer ordered the movement of the records intending to hide them from investigators or even from a potential future investigation, then criminal charges could well apply.

According to a senior White House official , the direction to move the transcripts came from National Security Council attorneys who ""directed that the classified document be handled appropriately."" White House officials also say that because the transcript was classified, there was nothing wrong with moving it to another system.

Anne (California): Can William Barr be forced to recuse himself from the Ukraine case?

The Attorney General absolutely should have recused himself from the Ukraine case, but he cannot be forced to do so.

Barr is now a witness in the case. Trump repeatedly mentioned Barr during the July 25 phone call with Zelensky. ""[W]hatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,"" Trump tells Zelensky in one passage.

We do not yet know whether Barr actually did the things Trump said he would do, and the Justice Department has claimed Trump never contacted Barr about working with the Ukrainians. The Justice Department also denied that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians.

Either way, Barr now has questions to answer. Did Trump or anyone else ever ask Barr to contact Ukraine? Did Barr know about communications between Trump or Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine? Like it or not, he is now a witness, and he has Trump's own words to thank for that.

One of the most fundamental rules of legal ethics is that a person cannot be both attorney and witness in the same case. That is especially true for Justice Department attorneys, who hold extraordinary power to bring criminal actions. Barr's own potential involvement as a witness in the case, at a minimum, creates an appearance of impropriety that he could and should have avoided by recusing.

All that said, while Barr plainly should have recused himself, there is simply no mechanism in the law to force him to do so. That is a decision left up to Barr himself, and he has botched it.

Becky (Texas): The Justice Department declined to investigate Trump's dealings with Ukraine because they determined that campaign dirt is not a ""thing of value."" Do you agree with this conclusion?

No, I think the Justice Department got it wrong here, and -- given Barr's history of slanting matters to favor Trump -- perhaps intentionally.

It is a federal crime to solicit from a foreign national a ""contribution or donation of money or other thing of value"" connected to a campaign. As CNN has reported , Barr's Justice Department decided not to even open an investigation into the Ukraine matter because, in its reading, political dirt on a campaign opponent is not a ""thing of value."" That's a tortured reading so I suspect it raises questions about the Justice Department's true motives.

The Federal Election Commission has recognized the "" broad scope "" of the foreign-national prohibition and said that ""even where the value of a good or service 'may be nominal or difficult to ascertain,'"" such contributions can be illegal. It really boils down to common sense: If dirt on an electoral opponent has no value, then why do campaigns routinely spend tens of thousands of dollars (or more) on opposition research?

Three questions to watch:

1. What will we learn from the second whistleblower , and will more public servants come forward with information damaging to Trump?

2. How will the House respond to the Trump administration blocking the testimony of EU ambassador Gordon Sondland , who participated in a damning text chain discussing Trump's dealings with Ukraine?"

In a fierce counter-attack after days of failing to control a torrent of damaging disclosures, the Trump White House branded the inquiry an illegal bid to overthrow the 2016 election and blocked testimony from a top diplomat.

""Never before in our history has the House of Representatives -- under the control of either political party -- taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelos i and her key committee chairs.

The letter in effect gave notice of all out political warfare as part of the administration's strategy to deprive investigators of all the testimony and evidence that they have demanded, in a clear effort to throttle the capacity of the probe into whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political opponent -- Joe Biden.

Pelosi says there is no constitutional requirement supporting Trump's demand for a full House vote to initiate impeachment proceedings -- one justification given for the President's refusal to cooperate.

But Trump's move left her with grave strategic decisions on what to do next in a confrontation that puts to the test the integrity of America's bedrock separation of powers and will determine whether she truly gamed out this duel several steps ahead.

Challenging Trump's position in court could bog down the impeachment drive in months of legal challenges. Folding the President's obstruction into articles of impeachment in short order could play into his claims that she's running a ""kangaroo court"" and rushing the most consequential function of Congress.

The American people will now be effectively asked whether a President who accepts few limits on his power can be held in check by a separate branch of government or whether he can avoid such an examination, a decision that will echo through history.

Democrats are already arguing that Trump's position is a de facto admission of guilt based on a legal and political house of sand.

""I guess they haven't read the Constitution,"" said Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, a Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

""If they don't defend themselves, against the copious evidence that we already have, then I think it disadvantages them,"" Malinowski told CNN's Erin Burnett.

""This is not the kind of investigation where we are starting with nothing -- we are starting with everything.""

Trump's call 'crazy' and 'frightening'

The nation's most serious political crisis in decades came to a head as more shocking details emerged of Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine.

The now famous whistleblower wrote a memo that describes a White House official as characterizing the call with Volodymyr Zelensky as ""crazy"" and ""frightening,"" a source familiar with the whistleblower complaint said.

The New York Times , which first reported the new details, said in its piece that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the discussion because in the official's view the president had clearly committed a criminal act.""

In another break in the drama, CNN reported that Gordon Sondland -- the US ambassador to the EU who Trump prevented from testifying to Congress on Tuesday -- directly called the President in September to find out what was going on amid discussions among his peers over whether US military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.

The nugget raises the possibility that Sondland's text to a colleague that there was no quid pro quo involved was on the orders of the President himself -- a possibility Democrats will surely want to investigate.

House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff suggested Monday that Sondland had texts and emails on a personal device that the State Department was refusing to hand over.

The new revelations explain why the White House is refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. It can't allow a window into wild, self-serving and possibly even criminal behavior by the President in his dealings with Ukraine that could turn Americans against him.

As Democrats seek to make a case that the President defies constitutional norms and abuses his power by setting foreign policy for personal political ends, Trump's aides must try to slow their momentum and weave a tale of congressional overreach.

The struggle intensified further after multiple polls showed a majority of Americans now support opening an impeachment inquiry.

But there is not yet a majority for removing the President from office, underscoring the critical impact of the political battle in Washington now being fully joined by both sides.

Trump dares Pelosi to hold risky vote

Trump's letter effectively dares Pelosi, who may want to protect her more moderate members from political damage, to hold a full vote in the House on moving forward with the inquiry.

Such a vote was held in the last two impeachment sagas concerning Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, but there is nothing in the Constitution that mandates such a vote. Trump's team says the absence of such a vote means that he has no choice but to withhold cooperation to preserve the scope of his office for future occupants.

""At a constitutional level, that is what we call complete and total nonsense,"" said CNN legal and national security analyst Susan Hennessey on ""The Situation Room.""

The White House maintained that without such a vote, the President and other Executive Branch officials will be denied basic rights available to all Americans.

It accused Pelosi of denying Trump the right to cross-examine witnesses, to have access to evidence, and for counsel to be present during depositions.

""Put simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen,"" Cipollone wrote.

He also argued that the President did nothing wrong in his call with Zelensky, and claimed that Democrats had prejudiced the case with unfair process and had violated the separation of powers.

The tone of the letter however was far more partisan in tone than legalistic, reflecting that the battle over Trump's fate will now come down to a vicious political fight. Mostly, it appeared to defend Trump based on the perceived unfairness of the political process rather than the merits of the Ukraine case.

Pelosi vowed in her own letter to House Democrats: ""The President will be held accountable. When it comes to impeachment, it is just about the facts and the Constitution,"" she wrote.

""At the same time as President Trump is obstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency, we have a responsibility to strengthen the institution in which we serve. This is essential if we are to honor the separation of powers which is the genius of the Constitution.""

The Speaker could decide to call the President's bluff by scheduling a full House vote. But there is no guarantee that Trump would cooperate if a full House vote takes place.

""We don't want to speculate on what would happen in various hypothetical situations"" Cipollone wrote.

A vote would also give Republicans a platform to grandstand and to turn the impeachment process into a circus -- as they have done in previous Democratic oversight hearings -- a factor that might weigh on Pelosi's deliberations.

But there is also an argument that offering Trump a blueprint for an open process, with clearly defined impeachment goals, is not just politically smart but it's the right thing to do at a perilous national moment that demands basic standards of fairness.

As the shockwaves of Trump's letter rocked Capitol Hill, Democrats issued a subpoena for testimony and evidence from Sondland, who was stopped from offering a deposition on Capitol Hill by the White House hours before his Tuesday appointment.

Still, as this tumultuous presidency has shown, refusing a congressional subpoena is less risky than ignoring a criminal summons. Democrats could hold recalcitrant witnesses in contempt but that would entail the kind of legal imbroglio they are seeking to avoid, which Trump plans to create.

Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff hinted that the remedy for the refusal of Sondland and other key officials to testify would rebound against the President.

""The failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,"" Schiff told reporters.

Girding for the battle ahead, the White House contacted outside lawyers as it seeks impeachment counsel. One of those attorneys is former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, CNN's Pamela Brown reported on Tuesday."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise.

Sanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an “idiot” for not taking climate change seriously:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

806,"Analysis by James Griffiths, CNN",,Trump wanted China's help to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Here's why that's a bad idea.,2019-10-04,CNN,Why China is the worst country Trump could ask for a favor,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/asia/china-trump-biden-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) ""We do not want to get in the middle of the US politics.""

That was the reaction of a Chinese diplomat to the revelation that United States President Donald Trump had urged Beijing to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for their business dealings in China

But the diplomat wasn't simply expressing a desire to avoid what is turning into an increasingly messy scandal that could dominate the run-up to the 2020 election -- but a foundational tenet of Chinese foreign policy.

In a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump seemed to confirm China's worst suspicions about the US in this regard. According to two people familiar with the discussion , Trump promised to remain quiet on ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong if trade talks progressed ( they haven't, and he hasn't ).

Whether China actually sticks to its principles of non-interference is highly debatable. But the idea that Beijing would ever agree openly to a tit-for-tat deal on something like the Biden investigation represents a major misunderstanding of how Chinese politics works, and perhaps provides a clue why Trump has failed to make any breakthroughs in other areas with Beijing.

Self-serving policy

China's policy of non-interference dates back to the Sino-Soviet split of 1956, which redefined the Cold War as a tripolar dispute and set the stage for rapprochement between Beijing and Washington.

Under the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , China -- along with other non-aligned powers like India and Myanmar -- agreed to uphold ""mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.""

But despite many of the other principles being openly contravened, non-interference has remained a key public tenet of Chinese foreign policy -- both in terms of what it claims to practice, and what it demands of allies and rivals.

At the United Nations for example, where the People's Republic of China has sat on the Security Council since 1971, Beijing has worked to ""move away from human rights-related civil developmental goals to economic development as the main aim,"" according to a recent report on China's role at the UN.

It has also repeatedly voted against any external interference in other countries' affairs. Beijing was a strong critic of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, though it initially supported action against Saddam Hussein in the 1990s following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

In 2007, Beijing joined with Moscow in vetoing any criticism of Myanmar on its human rights record; the following year both also vetoed sanctions against Zimbabwe , as they have multiple times with regard to Syria . China has also been the strongest check at the UN on any action against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, restraining what the international community can do and when.

This has remained consistent even as Beijing has increased its own role in peacekeeping efforts overseas, expanded its military footprint to Africa and throughout Asia, and lobbied country after country to drop support for Taiwan in favor of China

""China appears to have struck a most convenient -- and shrewd -- balance of selective legitimate foreign intervention and soft power efforts, while at the same time maintaining the capacity to both veto Security Council resolutions as it sees fit and shake off any reproach of its domestic policies and strategies,"" according to Sherif A. Elgebeily, director of the London-based Center for the Study of International Peace and Security.

Tactical misstep

While it is often couched in noble terms, the principle of non-interference is all about China avoiding criticism of or meddling in its own policies. From Beijing's perspective, whatever other countries think about its actions in Xinjiang, Tibet or Hong Kong, their responsibility or ability to do anything about them stops at China's borders.

Speaking at the United Nations last month, Foreign Minister Wang Yi spelled this out , saying ""if the China-US relationship is to remain stable, it is most important that we respect each other's territorial sovereignty, social system and development path, and try not to impose one's will or model on the other.""

""China will never interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and we trust that the American people are capable of sorting out their own problems,"" Wang said. ""Likewise, we expect the US to treat China in the same spirit and not interfere in China's internal affairs.""

That's why it is so bizarre -- and such a potential tactical misstep -- for Trump to ask China, both in private and now openly, to investigate one of his potential electoral rivals.

Beijing may not stick to its principles in practice, and indeed there is plenty of evidence that China runs the type of influence campaigns and behind-the-scenes diplomacy that both Moscow and Washington are adept at, but it is never going to acknowledge this publicly or agree to a tit-for-tat deal.

Doing so would open the door to foreign interference in China's own affairs, one that Beijing has spent decades trying to jam shut as hard as possible."

He cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.

Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality.

The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a “closely divided Congress.” Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas – such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals.

“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” Bloomberg wrote.

“The fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,” he continued.

He added:

The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren’t up to the job.

The op-ed follows reports of Bloomberg’s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field” in March, Biden’s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision.

Bloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a source, described as a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

As CNBC reported:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

While Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes, mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as “expodentially,” mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are “clipping coupons in the stock market” during a discussion on the economy:

If Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China– particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is “not a dictator”:

Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, testified that around January 2019 Giuliani requested a visa for former Ukrainian prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin to travel to the United States. Shokin had been pushed out of his position as Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2016 after pressure from Western leaders, including Biden, over concerns that he was not pursuing corruption cases.

Giuliani has previously told CNN he wanted to interview Shokin in person because the Ukrainian promised to reveal dirt on Democrats.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified before congressional lawmakers on Oct. 15

Kent told congressional investigators the State Department had objected to the request, and State did not grant the visa. Giuliani, Kent said, then appealed to the White House to have State reverse its decision. Rob Blair, a White House aide to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, consulted with State about the decision and sided with the department's rejection of the visa, according to a person familiar.

Shokin's visa was never granted, although Giuliani eventually spoke with Shokin over Skype.

Adam Schiff, Syria, and his own approval rating.

A photo of Joe Biden

Trump tweeted Sunday of Biden: ""Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter...""

: The photo Trump appears to be referencing does not show Joe Biden playing golf with the ""company boss"" of Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian natural gas company where his son Hunter Biden was a board member. The person in the photo is an American named Devon Archer, a longtime business associate of Hunter Biden who has also served on the Burisma board. A board member is not the ""company boss"" -- nor an ""exec,"" as a previous Trump tweet had identified Archer.

The fourth person in the photo with Archer and the Bidens has not been publicly identified, but he is not Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky or top executive Taras Burdeinyi.

Hunter Biden

Trump tweeted Sunday that Hunter Biden was ""handed $100,000 a month (Plus,Plus)"" for his role at Burisma.

Facts First: There is no basis for the ""$100,000 a month (Plus, Plus)"" assertion. The New York Times : There is no basis for the ""$100,000 a month (Plus, Plus)"" assertion. The New York Times reported that Hunter Biden was paid ""as much as $50,000 per month in some months"" for his role on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.

The whistleblowers

Trump tweeted Saturday: ""The first so-called second hand information 'Whistleblower' got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another 'Whistleblower' is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info.""

Facts First: The first whistleblower's account of the call was mostly accurate, not ""almost completely wrong."" In fact, the : The first whistleblower's account of the call was mostly accurate, not ""almost completely wrong."" In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close. In addition, the inspector general for the intelligence committee said the first whistleblower had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct"" along with information the whistleblower was told by others. And the New York Times reported that another person considering becoming a whistleblower has ""more direct information about the events than the first whistleblower,"" not ""second hand info"" as Trump tweeted.

Lawyer Mark Zaid, who represents the first whistleblower, announced Sunday that he also represents another whistleblower who has firsthand knowledge that supports the claims from the first whistleblower. It was not clear if that is the same person described in the Times article.

The first whistleblower reported that Trump ""pressured"" Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, to help in locating Democratic computer servers and to speak with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. Trump can argue that he was making friendly requests, not applying pressure, but he did make all three requests, according to the rough transcript released by the White House.

The first whistleblower also alleged that Trump suggested Zelensky might want to keep Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, on the job. The rough transcript does not show Trump saying this. However, it is not a verbatim transcript.

The first whistleblower and Schiff

Trump tweeted Sunday: ""Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan ""Whistleblower"" & lawyer...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!""

Facts First: Members of the House are : Members of the House are not subject to impeachment , though they can be expelled. The actions of Pelosi and Schiff do not come close to meeting the Constitution's definition of treason. And it is not illegal for the House Intelligence Committee to offer guidance to a potential whistleblower about how to report alleged wrongdoing, as a Schiff spokesman said a committee aide did.

Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland said it was a ""regular occurrence"" for a whistleblower to contact the committee for guidance, and said that committee staff ""appropriately advised"" the whistleblower.

When Republicans controlled the committee in 2016, a spokesman for then-chair Rep. Devin Nunes told The Intercept that they had received whistleblower complaints from ""individuals who approach the committee directly.""

A timetable for Syria

Trump tweeted Monday morning about his decision to pull troops out of northern Syria: ""The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. (Trump had previously : There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. (Trump had previously claimed , eight times, that US involvement was supposed to last ""three months"" or ""four months."")

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small.

Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president’s deputy campaign manger, sent a letter to the Times on Wednesday, lambasting the paper for publishing an op-ed by Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailing several such instances. In particular, Schweizer, who helms the Government Accountability Institute, noted that the former vice president’s youngest son, Hunter, profited off deals with Ukraine and China that were inaccessible to the average American businessman.

Instead of refuting Schweizer’s argument, Bedingfield’s letter attacked the Times for having published the opinion piece in the first place. The deputy campaign manger even went to the extent of accusing the paper of not having “internalized the sobering lessons of 2016” by giving “top billing” to a “right-wing polemicist.”

“But today’s decision is hardly the first example,” Bedingfield wrote, before proceeding to claim the Times had an “outsized hand in the spread of a baseless conspiracy theory” concerning the Biden family. “What was especially troubling about the Times’s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting… this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon.”

The campaign’s line of attack, although unsurprising given their frequent broadsides against the media, comes as Hunter Biden’s dealings have spilled into the open amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. At the center of the inquiry is a conversation the president had with the Ukrainian government suggesting they probe how the younger Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden was appointed to the oil and gas giant’s board, a position which paid as much as $83,000 per month, in 2014, around the same time his father was made the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.

Breitbart News has followed that story, along with Hunter Biden’s ties to a private equity firm bankrolled by the Chinese government, since Schweizer published his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends."

Booker's comments come as Trump continues to lash out at Biden and his son, Hunter, after a House impeachment inquiry was launched last month. The inquiry came in the wake of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son.

A photo of Joe Biden

Trump tweeted Sunday of Biden: ""Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter...""

: The photo Trump appears to be referencing does not show Joe Biden playing golf with the ""company boss"" of Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian natural gas company where his son Hunter Biden was a board member. The person in the photo is an American named Devon Archer, a longtime business associate of Hunter Biden who has also served on the Burisma board. A board member is not the ""company boss"" -- nor an ""exec,"" as a previous Trump tweet had identified Archer.

The fourth person in the photo with Archer and the Bidens has not been publicly identified, but he is not Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky or top executive Taras Burdeinyi.

Hunter Biden

Trump tweeted Sunday that Hunter Biden was ""handed $100,000 a month (Plus,Plus)"" for his role at Burisma.

Facts First: There is no basis for the ""$100,000 a month (Plus, Plus)"" assertion. The New York Times : There is no basis for the ""$100,000 a month (Plus, Plus)"" assertion. The New York Times reported that Hunter Biden was paid ""as much as $50,000 per month in some months"" for his role on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.

The whistleblowers

Trump tweeted Saturday: ""The first so-called second hand information 'Whistleblower' got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another 'Whistleblower' is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info.""

Facts First: The first whistleblower's account of the call was mostly accurate, not ""almost completely wrong."" In fact, the : The first whistleblower's account of the call was mostly accurate, not ""almost completely wrong."" In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close. In addition, the inspector general for the intelligence committee said the first whistleblower had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct"" along with information the whistleblower was told by others. And the New York Times reported that another person considering becoming a whistleblower has ""more direct information about the events than the first whistleblower,"" not ""second hand info"" as Trump tweeted.

Lawyer Mark Zaid, who represents the first whistleblower, announced Sunday that he also represents another whistleblower who has firsthand knowledge that supports the claims from the first whistleblower. It was not clear if that is the same person described in the Times article.

The first whistleblower reported that Trump ""pressured"" Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, to help in locating Democratic computer servers and to speak with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. Trump can argue that he was making friendly requests, not applying pressure, but he did make all three requests, according to the rough transcript released by the White House.

The first whistleblower also alleged that Trump suggested Zelensky might want to keep Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, on the job. The rough transcript does not show Trump saying this. However, it is not a verbatim transcript.

The first whistleblower and Schiff

Trump tweeted Sunday: ""Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan ""Whistleblower"" & lawyer...This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!""

Facts First: Members of the House are : Members of the House are not subject to impeachment , though they can be expelled. The actions of Pelosi and Schiff do not come close to meeting the Constitution's definition of treason. And it is not illegal for the House Intelligence Committee to offer guidance to a potential whistleblower about how to report alleged wrongdoing, as a Schiff spokesman said a committee aide did.

Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland said it was a ""regular occurrence"" for a whistleblower to contact the committee for guidance, and said that committee staff ""appropriately advised"" the whistleblower.

When Republicans controlled the committee in 2016, a spokesman for then-chair Rep. Devin Nunes told The Intercept that they had received whistleblower complaints from ""individuals who approach the committee directly.""

A timetable for Syria

Trump tweeted Monday morning about his decision to pull troops out of northern Syria: ""The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. (Trump had previously : There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. (Trump had previously claimed , eight times, that US involvement was supposed to last ""three months"" or ""four months."")

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

""I did nothing wrong at all,"" Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview that ran Tuesday morning. ""However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is -- it's a swamp, in many ways? Yeah. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.""

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Later in the interview, Hunter added this: ""You know what? I'm a human. And you know what, did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based on some unethical lapse? Absolutely not.""

Hunter Biden was careful to note that he didn't tell his father (or the campaign) before deciding to speak publicly about his seat on the board of Burisma Holdings, which reportedly paid him as much as $50,000 a month. And Hunter reiterated what he has said before -- that he and his father had only a single conversation about Burisma in which Joe Biden warned his son, ""I hope you know what you're doing.""

President Donald Trump has sought to use Hunter Biden's connection to Burisma against Joe Biden -- even soliciting help from the president of Ukraine on a phone call, leading to the current impeachment inquiry in the US House.

But Trump's repeated insistence that Joe Biden did something nefarious by trying to remove a prosecutor in Ukraine is simply not borne out by the facts. No matter how many times Trump screams corruption, it doesn't change the fact that there is zero evidence that Joe Biden's actions in Ukraine as vice president had anything to do with his son. None.

OK, we all clear on that? OK! Good!

But that doesn't mean that Hunter Biden won't be a problem for his father's campaign.

Now, it's very unlikely that any of Biden's Democratic opponents will publicly attack the former vice president over his son -- either in Tuesday night's debate or in the remainder of the primary. In fact, it's more likely that Democrats in the race will rally around Biden on the issue as a sort of unified front against Trump and his tactics.

""I will be standing firmly in defense of Joe Biden throughout this process because this can in no way besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades,"" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker told CNN's Jake Tapper last week about the Hunter Biden story.

But behind the scenes -- and among undecided Democratic voters -- Hunter Biden's decision to admit an error in judgment and to do so on the eve of crucial debate (and moment) for his father's campaign is likely to raise lots of questions. And very few of those questions are good for Joe Biden.

Because here's the thing: Hunter Biden could very well be a problem for his father's presidential campaign.

As the New Yorker's Adam Entous put it in a lengthy profile of Hunter Biden earlier this year

""There is little question that Hunter's proximity to power shaped the arc of his career, and that, as the former [Biden] aide told me, 'Hunter is super rich terrain.'""

Hunter Biden's personal and professional weaknesses are both well-known and well-worn.

He had admitted to using cocaine in college and as an adult. He has acknowledged that he has struggled with alcohol addiction. In the early 2000s, he admitted himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center for a month.

And his relationships have been tabloid fodder, fairly or not. He and his first wife are divorced. For a time after his brother Beau's death, Hunter and Beau's widow were together. In May of this year, he got remarried after a short romance.

The Yale law graduate worked for a DC lobbying company although, according to his boss, never on clients that touched his father's work as a senator from Delaware in any way. (Hunter Biden eventually dropped all of his lobbying clients and resigned from the board of Amtrak when his father was chosen as the vice presidential nominee in 2008.)

(Side bar: Hunter told the New Yorker of the move: ""I wanted my father to have a clean slate. I didn't want to limit him in any way."")

And during his father's years alongside Barack Obama in the White House, Hunter started a company with, among others, Chris Heinz, a stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry. The company's goal was to help foreign businesses expand into the United States and other markets. That's where he came into contact with Burisma Holdings.

What's clear here is that Hunter Biden has benefited from being the son of Joe Biden. Kind of like how Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump have benefitted from being the children of Donald Trump. In the same way, Donald Trump benefited from being the son of Fred Trump.

And on and on it goes. The scions of wealthy or influential -- or wealthy and influential -- people are often giving a series of helping hands by their parents as they move through life.

The question that voters in 2020 will have to answer is whether that fact of life bothers them. Or, more accurately, whether it bothers them enough not to vote for Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee for president or to be the president come 2021.

But, that we are even asking the question isn't great news for Joe Biden. We know from a slew of polling that a) Democratic voters prize electability over all else and b) Biden is, currently, regarded as the most electable Democratic candidate against Trump.

There's no doubt that watching Trump turn Hunter Biden into a political pinata in the last few weeks will give some undecided Democratic voters pause when they consider what the President might do to the former vice president if the two squared off in the general election. And, that's no good for Joe Biden."

Schweizer said, “What you have is the Bidens exploiting the political power that Joe Biden had as vice president. When he was vice president of the United States, he had two countries of all the countries in the world where he was point-person on foreign policy. [He was] appointed to that position by the president, Barack Obama. One of those countries was Ukraine. The other was China.”

“Those are the two countries where Hunter Biden cashed in big time for the benefit of the Biden family,” continued Schweizer. “It was about the fact that his father was steering U.S. policy, and they exploited that situation to sign these lucrative deals with Burisma in Ukraine and Chinese companies in China.”

LISTEN:



“They’re not the victims at all,” said Schweizer of Joe and Hunter Biden. “They’re the recipients. They’re, in a sense, the extortionists … They’re not victims by any stretch of the imagination.”

Schweizer described the foundations of suspicion regarding the Bidens’ selling of political influence. “You find an overlay of all kinds of activities. We know that Devon Archer went and met with Joe Biden in the White House just days before both he and Hunter Biden started receiving these payments from Burisma. We know that when there were issues coming up related to natural gas and USAID money going into the energy sector, there was communication involving Burisma.”

“It’s the sort of fact pattern that is deeply troubling, and it’s the reason why I believe this needs to be investigated,” Schweizer determined. “What Democrats are basically saying is, ‘There’s no crime here that you’ve yet demonstrated, so there’s no reason to investigate.’ Of course, that’s not the same standard they apply to Donald Trump or others. Apparently, only when it comes to Joe Biden or the Clintons, you have to demonstrate the crime before the investigation, which I think is ridiculous. The reason you have investigations is to determine whether you look at a certain fact pattern that’s troubling, and you investigate to find whether a crime has been committed.”

Congressional use of subpoena power must be deployed to understand the nature of the Bidens’ financial dealings with foreign states and business interests, explained Schweizer.

“The only way we are going to know and get our hands on fully understanding what happened and what this relationship was all about is by investigating,” said Schweizer. “You need somebody with subpoena power. You need to look at the recorded communications, just like we’ve had the transcript of the president’s conversation with the Ukrainian president come out, those need to be looked at as they relate to Joe Biden and the Ukrainians.”

Schweizer went on, “We need to look at any email communications that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden might have had as it relates to Burisma. We need to ask Ukrainian prosecutors to look at the financial records of Burisma and their internal communications. That’s the only way we’re going to really understand and the position that people have taken that until you demonstrate the crime there needs to be o investigation is absolutely backwards and completely ridiculous.”

“There’s lots of evidence that an investigation was underfoot [in Ukraine] and that Hunter Biden was being investigated,” said Schweizer, recalling Joe Biden’s boast of leveraging U.S. foreign aid — as vice president — against Ukraine to coerce the termination of its then-prosecutor Viktor Shokin. “There were very specific alleged crimes that they were looking into. One of those was that [Hunter Biden] was functioning illegally as a lobbyist, and the other one was that there was a conflict between his compensation as a paid consultant [while also being] a board member, and according to Ukrainian law, you can’t mix those two.”

Schweizer advised, “We ultimately don’t exactly know everything that’s happened because nobody yet has subpoena power, and my point is that’s why this needs to be investigated. [Congress is] certainly trying to exert subpoena power to investigate the president. They’ve released sensitive communication involving phone conversations. We have none of that as it relates to the Bidens. We know of the flow of money. We know of the relationships. We know of Joe Biden’s bragging. It’s time for the Senate, in particular, to say, ‘We are going to investigate this and get to the bottom of it. This is corruption at the highest levels.'”

“There needs to be an investigation of any and all communication that took place,” Schweizer concluded.

The tagline — with its unfortunate double-meaning — was reported by the Washington Post, which obtained excerpts of the speech in advance, merely hours after several new polls suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had surged past Biden into first place in the race for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

A Monmouth Poll of early primary states released Wednesday found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (25%) by 3% — barely within the poll’s 3.1% margin of error. A new YouGov/Economist poll found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (22%) by 6%.

Moreover, the breaking news that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, had been admitted to hospital for emergency heart surgery also drew attention to Biden’s age (76) and his own history of health problems.

Still, Biden wanted Trump — and Democrats — to know that he would fight on, in response to Trump’s charges that he and his son, Hunter, were “stone-cold crooked.” The Washington Post reported from his remarks, as prepared for delivery:

“Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me — I’m not going anywhere,” Biden will say. “You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.” … Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, “like every bully in history—he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.”

The Post concluded its story by quoting Biden: “Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what’s that fellow’s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?”

In Bedingfield's words, ""What was especially troubling about the Times's active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel, this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon.""

Infuriated by publication of Schweizer op-ed

The letter came after The Times on Wednesday published an op-ed from Peter Schweizer, who the Biden campaign referred to as a ""discredited right-wing polemicist."" Schweizer, an author, has been one of the top people pushing the claim that Biden abused his office. Previously, Schweizer pushed the debunked Hillary Clinton / Uranium One scandal, which was given life in a now-infamous 2015 story in The Times.

In Wednesday's op-ed Schweizer, whose representative did not immediately reply to a request for comment, conceded Hunter Biden's business dealings were legal, but suggested they shouldn't have been. The Biden campaign said in its letter that publishing the op-ed shows ""how little"" The Times ""has internalized the sobering lessons of 2016.""

""Despite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers -- including some by The Times -- to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family,"" Bedingfield wrote. ""This leaves us with a critical question: are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?""

NYT: Our coverage ""has been fair and accurate""

In a statement, a spokesperson for The Times pushed back strongly against the Biden campaign's letter. ""Our coverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate,"" the spokesperson said, noting that the Biden campaign ""obviously disagrees."" The spokesperson said The Times ""will continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we're happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage.""

In response to the publishing of the Schweizer op-ed, the spokesperson noted it was published by Opinion ""where their mission is to invite intelligent discussion on a range of opinions and ideas."" The spokesperson added, ""The op-ed makes an argument that nonpartisan government watchdogs would make, arguing in favor of a law that would prohibit self-dealing by those with government connections.""

Biden camp also sent letters to Facebook and Twitter

The Biden campaign on Wednesday also sent letters to both Facebook and Twitter, imploring the companies not to run an ad that spread the debunked theory about Biden and Ukraine. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook denied the Biden campaign's request.

In a statement, Biden press secretary TJ Ducklo said the spread of false info ""poisons the public discourse."" Ducklo added, ""Whether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America. It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform.""

>> On a related note: Remember last week when I wrote that MSNBC said the controversial Trump campaign ad was ""under review""? I checked in with a spokesperson on Wednesday to see at what conclusion the network ultimately arrived. The MSNBC spokesperson told me that, days later, the Trump ad remains ""under review."" Hopefully it doesn't take this long for MSNBC's standards department to review stories...

Bottom line

The Biden campaign is making it clear that it will call out tech and media platforms for the spread of misinformation related to Biden. As a campaign source told me, it's ""part of a larger strategy not to let the same coverage that corrupted the 2016 election happen this time around."""

Schweizer’s Secret Empires was first to uncover the details behind how Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father, then-Vice President Biden, steered $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine.

“I think when you overlay the financial payments with the fact that Joe Biden as point person on Obama administration policy to Ukraine was steering billions of dollars of Western money to Ukraine it becomes crystal clear exactly why they were paying him money,” Schweizer told Mark Levin. “They wanted access and they wanted to influence Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, CNN revealed the Biden campaign “did not rule out” reaching out to Google and YouTube as well.

The Biden campaign sent letters to Facebook and Twitter, demanding that they ban an ad by U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.

Trump’s re-election campaign ad accuses the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, of corrupt activities in Ukraine.

Unlike CNN, the Times, Facebook, and Twitter have resited Biden’s effort to silence Trump’s assertion that Biden engaged in improper dealings with Ukraine while serving as vice president.

On Wednesday, Biden campaign staffers sent also sent a letter to the NYT complaining about its coverage of the former vice president’s alleged pattern of corruption in Ukraine, including the newspaper’s publication of an editorial by author and Breitbart senior contributor Peter Schweizer.

A spokesperson for NYT maintained that its coverage has been “fair and accurate.”

The newspaper will “continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race,” it added.

“We’re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,” the spokesperson declared.

The refusal by NYT, Twitter, and Facebook to put the lid on information about Biden’s link to corruption in Ukraine has angered the Biden campaign, prompting it to lash out.

Facebook rejected a request from Biden’s 2020 campaign to remove a video ad by Trump’s re-election campaign that highlights allegations of corruption against Biden and his son, Hunter.

In a statement, the social media platform said its decision is “grounded in Facebook’s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.”

Irked by Facebook’s response, Biden campaign spokesperson TJ Ducklo called the reply “unacceptable” and said that the dissemination of “objectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy.”

Ducklo did not explicitly comment on the substance of the ad’s accusations.

The video asserts that Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless the eastern European country fired a prosecutor reportedly investigating an energy company. Hunter Biden served on the Ukrainian company’s board at the time.

Biden bragged on video about bullying Ukraine into firing the prosecutor.

Titled “Biden Corruption,” the 30-second video clip is running on various cable networks and online.

On Wednesday, CNN obtained a letter from the Biden presidential campaign asking Twitter to reject what appears to be the same Trump re-election campaign ad.

The letter “acknowledges that the social media company has said the ad complies with its policies,” the news network noted. Nevertheless, the Biden campaign reportedly requested that Twitter “promptly reassess” that position.

CNN reported:

Specifically, the letter calls on Twitter to make a distinction between the personal account of a politician and paid advertising content … Twitter has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. The move from Biden’s team appears to be part of a broad campaign to respond to Trump’s attacks on social media.

Last Monday, CNN refused to run the “Biden Corruption” ad, alleging the video “does not meet our advertising standards.”

“In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,” the network added in a statement.

Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 campaign’s communications director, lambasted CNN’s decision, accusing the network of “spend[ing] all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming.”

House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming he attempted to coerce his Ukrainian counterpart into investigating the corruption allegations against Biden and his son.

Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have denied the claim. The White House is refusing to cooperate with the impeachment investigation, saying it is a “partisan and unconstitutional” probe."

President Trump laced into Biden and his beleaguered son Hunter several times during his rally as the pair face increased scrutiny over allegations of international corruption. “Joe’s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,” President Trump recounted to rally attendees. “Whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?” he asked. “Where’s Hunter?”

“Hey fellas, I have an idea for a new T-shirt,” the president then quipped. “Let’s do another T-shirt: ‘Where’s Hunter?'”

At another point in the rally, President Trump turned his attention to the 76-year-old Biden, who he said was only a good vice president because he understood how to “kiss” former President Barack Obama’s “ass.”

“Two months after President Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy… and the press will not write it. They say, ‘In totally unsubstantiated charges,’ every time they talk about him, ‘President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune, now you know that’s a totally unsubstantiated charge.’ Really? It’s not unsubstantiated, it’s a fact,” he added.

As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter’s investment company scored a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further, then-vice president Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 per month as a member of its board, despite having no expertise in the energy sector. Biden later boasted before the Council of Foreign Relations that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was removed from his post."

But by highlighting the dangers of blending business opportunities with political power, Trump has resurrected an issue that has dogged his own family from the start of his campaign.

These headaches for Biden could have been avoided if his son, Hunter Biden, simply did not conduct foreign business while his father was the sitting vice president. It's more an issue of potential greed and poor judgment than corruption. There is no evidence that any of his activities were illegal, despite Trump's recent tweet saying, ""there is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions.""

Hunter Biden announced on Sunday that he would resign from the board of a Chinese-backed company and pledged that he would not do business with any foreign-owned companies if his father is elected in 2020. This plan, if Hunter Biden sticks to it, offers a much cleaner break from foreign business entanglements than Trump's family has pursued during his first term in office.

It looks like Trump's family has done some of the same things that he now says create a conflict of interest for Biden, primarily making money oversees with a parent in the White House.

The President's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, have continued to run the Trump Organization, including work on overseas deals. Trump never divested his stake of the company, so he stands to benefit financially from any foreign projects his sons are handling.

Since taking office, Trump's company has raked in millions of dollars from foreign deals, and he holds more than $130 million in foreign assets, according to the Center for Responsive Politics

When Trump took office, he promised his company wouldn't pursue any new foreign deals. After all, a centerpiece of his campaign was attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her financial ties to foreign governments, in the form of paid speeches and donations to her family's charity.

But that commitment hasn't stopped Trump's family from plowing ahead on projects in India, Indonesia, Uruguay and the Philippines that were already in the works before his swearing-in.

""My father's not at all involved, and he wouldn't make decisions that affect a country based on a real estate deal, let's just be very, very clear about that,"" Trump Jr. said in Indonesia this year.

While promoting these grandfathered-in projects, Trump's sons may have blurred the lines.

Trump hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House and has tried to forge a close relationship. Trump heaped praise on Modi after his sweeping reelection victory this year, saying, ""he is a great man and leader for the people of India - they are lucky to have him!""

Meanwhile, Trump Jr. visited India last year to promote an apartment development, and his trip spurred millions of dollars in sales. Ethics watchdogs cried foul when advertisements near New Delhi appeared to sell access to Trump Jr. He was also forced to abruptly adjust plans for a speech that would touch on political topics at a conference where Modi was also speaking.

During the trip, Trump Jr. acknowledged the challenge of fully separate business and politics, ""because I believe in what my father's doing, and he is certainly up against a lot of adversity.""

A Trump Organization spokesman did not answer emails seeking comment. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said, ""The Trumps were successful before Donald Trump became President. Hunter Biden owes his success to his father's public office. There is no comparison.""

A more glaring potential conflict exists within the White House. Trump did something that Biden never did: He gave White House jobs to his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

JUST WATCHED Biden calls for Trump impeachment for first time Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden calls for Trump impeachment for first time 02:40

Last year, China approved more than a dozen trademarks for Ivanka-branded products. The approval came around the same time the US and China were trying to jump-start trade talks, raising the possibility that the Chinese were trying to curry favor with Trump at a key moment.

The president of Ivanka Trump's fashion line previously said these approvals were part of ""the normal course of business"" to protect her brand. Murtaugh, the Trump campaign spokesman, said Monday that dozens of Chinese companies tried to trademark Ivanka's name after her father took office in 2017, and any comparison between her and Hunter Biden are ""ludicrous.""

According to The Washington Post , foreign countries have privately plotted how to manipulate Kushner because of his business entanglements, as he has refused to divest form his family's vast holdings. During the Russia investigation, special counsel prosecutors asked witnesses about Kushner's overseas business dealings, though he was never accused of wrongdoing.

The President has co-mingled business with politics, holding countless political events and fundraisers at his properties. He went so far as to say he might hold the next G7 meeting at one of his golf resorts in Florida, putting a Trump property center stage for a major diplomatic event.

Over the years, the boundaries between Trump's business empire and his political apparatus have become less and less clear. Before taking office, Trump very publicly handed the reins of his company to his sons, suggesting that they would focus on business. But they've emerged as political surrogates, stumping for their father and Republican candidates across the country.

Sometimes the politics spills into official business events. Eric Trump, appearing at the Yahoo Finance summit last week in his capacity as a Trump Organization executive, brought up the Ukraine controversy and said Hunter Biden's business arrangements there appeared ""fishy.""

Despite their own overlapping affairs, and ongoing ethics concerns, the Trump family has drawn a hard line when it comes to Biden and have continued to hammer him on a near-daily basis."

The New York Times was first to report the meeting on Sunday, noting the financiers were treated to a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign’s headquarters and strategy, including a private address by the former vice president.

“In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said,” the Times reported. “The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open them to the press.”

The meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among 2020 Democrats. Biden, who once led the field by as much 26 percentage points, now trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Adding to the campaign’s trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by Warren but also Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who polled significantly below the former vice president.

Biden’s mounting problems and the emergence of Warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in Philadelphia.

“We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” Denise Bauer, a Biden bundler and former ambassador to Belgium, told the Times. To stress the point, she added that the former vice president’s donors were “going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

It is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to save the 76-year-old Biden’s third White House bid. Unlike Warren or Sanders, the former vice president’s fundraising has failed to diversify past the top-dollar level. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement in late April. Top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he’s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico on Friday.

If you don’t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can’t compete,” Kochel said. “Biden looks like he can’t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How’s he going to compete with Trump?”

Despite Biden’s money woes, the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his son’s shadowy ties to foreign governments, which have taken center stage in the battle to impeach President Donald Trump. The controversy started last month when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden’s lack of experience, coupled with his father’s influence over Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest.

Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.

A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine’s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Biden, for his part, has refused to discuss the matter, even lashing out at the media for asking if his son’s work with Burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency. The tactic, however, does not seem to be doing Biden or his campaign any favors. A new poll released on Friday indicates that 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden’s work abroad.

Some of the donors gathered in Philadelphia this weekend, though, saw the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Ukraine in a different light. Sheila Nix, who once served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, told the Times the former vice president’s struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once.

“He’s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he’s doing a great job,” Nix said. “It’s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.”"

Trump said he thought Obama was “hiding” and raised the possibility that Obama was aware of the efforts from former FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Partial transcript as follows:

you know, I want to ask a question that I haven’t heard you answer. And that is, where is Barack Obama in all this? Why haven’t we heard from him? I mean, in the beginning of your administration, he wouldn’t stop talking. And now, he’s nowhere to be heard. Where is he?

TRUMP: I think he’s hiding.

PIRRO: Why?

TRUMP: I think he knows all about it. And we are talking about investigate the investigators. We’re talking about the beginning. And it was really before I took office. It was — if you look at the insurance policy with Strzok and Page, just in case she should lose, we’ve got an insurance policy. That’s what all this stuff has been about, the insurance policy.

These are bad people. These are evil people. And this was the insurance policy. The two lovers, Strzok and Page. Two beauties.

(LAUGHTER)

PIRRO: Well, you know …

TRUMP: And it’s a terrible thing, what they do to this country. Terrible. But we are winning. And we’re winning big. And the American public knows it. And that’s why I think they want to stay away. But they can do whatever they want. But they want to stay away.

Maher said, “Joe Biden has a little Ukraine problem too. He didn’t answer that question too well, I thought, in the debate. He didn’t own it. His son was getting 50 grand a month to do nothing in a field he knew nothing about. It’s very swampy. My question is this: Al Franken had to go away for the Democrats. Because they said, well, we have to be like Caesar’s wife on the #MeToo issue. We can’t have any tainting on that, so that the Republicans can’t say, oh, you guys are bad on that too.

In a widely distributed video, Joe Biden confirmed that he successfully pressured, under threat of withholding $1 billion in U.S. government aid, the Ukrainian government to fire Shokin, who had allegedly launched an investigation into Burisma, which had purportedly paid Biden’s son Hunter $50,000 a month.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

Warren surpassed Biden in the Real Clear Politics average last week and currently sits less than two points behind Biden in the current average, with 26 percent to Biden’s 27.8.

Biden’s loss of his previously held frontrunner status has Bloomberg mulling a bid, although a source told CNBC that Bloomberg would not make a move unless Biden dropped out of the race.

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The poll – which surveyed 423 registered New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary from September 25-29, 2019 – showed Warren leading the primary field with 25 percent support and Biden on her heels with 24 percent support. Sanders, however, struggled to keep up, falling to a distant third place with just 11 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth place, just one point behind the socialist senator, with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) tumbled to fifth place, failing to garner double digits in the Granite State, seeing just five percent support.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

A Monmouth Poll released last Tuesday showed a similar trend, with Warren edging out Biden (27 percent to 25 percent) and leading Sanders – who garnered 12 percent support – by double digits:

Reports emerged of a staffer shakeup for the Sanders campaign last month. The Sanders campaign moved presidential campaign operations state director Joe Caiazzo from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and replaced him with Shannon Jackson, who served as a senior adviser during Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid and ran his Senate reelection campaign.

While the Sanders campaign continues to reconfigure and strategize on how to win over New Hampshire as it did in 2016, the campaign reported a monstrous $25.3 million received in the third quarter, signaling that his campaign is in it for the long haul."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been hospitalized with serious heart problems, what had already been a bad week for former Vice President Joe Biden has just gotten even worse.

I’ll get to the why of that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at all the other bad news.

The Polls

As I have said since the beginning, the only polls I’m going to take seriously are post-Labor Day, after summer is over and people are actually paying attention to the race. It was and still is my belief that while enjoying the summer months, Democrat voters parked their votes on tried-and-true Uncle Joe but that this could change after people started to tune in.

Well, tuning in, they are, and Biden’s slide is very real and may not have yet reached bottom.

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Biden went from a double-digit national lead ten days ago to just a two-point lead today.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is climbing, is attracting the crowds, while Slow Joe falls and can hardly attract flies.

In the all-important early primary states, Biden is losing in Iowa, is only three points up in New Hampshire (Warren leads in the two most recent polls), and only two points up in Nevada. (Warren and Biden are tied in the latest poll.)

Biden’s firewall in South Carolina remains strong — he’s up by 22 points, but if he loses New Hampshire and Iowa, he will have to make history to win the Democrat nomination.

The Picture

Last month, Joe Biden told us, “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

That is a flat-out lie.

This entire scandal revolves around Biden’s son Hunter, who made more than $50,000 a month — a month! — for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company. The problem, of course, is that Hunter has no experience whatsoever in that field and that when Hunter scored that sweet gig, then-President Obama had put Joe Biden in charge of dealing with Ukraine.

What’s more, once a Ukrainian prosecutor began to look into Hunter’s company, Joe threatened to withhold crucial U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired — which he was.

Now, liars in the media, serial liars like Jake Tapper, are lying about this — saying the prosecutor was not looking into Hunter Biden’s company when Daddy Joe forced him out, but this very same prosecutor has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying that he was.

Anyway, back to the lie…

To begin with, we know Daddy Joe spoke to Hunter about his shady, overseas business dealings because in an interview with the New Yorker, Hunter said they spoke about his shady, overseas business dealings.

But now, we have nothing less than photographic proof…

Look at this, y’all… An actual photograph of then-Vice President Joe Biden and his ne’er-do-well son out golfing with a board member of the company that hired No-Experience-Hunter.

That’s whatchoo call a clean bust.

The Pulmonary

While we all hope and pray Bernie Sanders makes a full and speedy recovery, the political reality of the matter is still the political reality of the matter.

While on the campaign trail, Bernie felt chest pains, was rushed to the hospital, and surgery was performed to implant two heart stents. Bernie is still in the hospital, his presidential campaign is suspended, as is his political advertising.

This is a serious and significant development, but not just for Bernie.

Bernie Sanders is 78-years-old.

Joe Biden will be 77 next month.

And let’s not forget that until today’s news, Bernie was by far the most robust and energetic of the two.

After all, it was Joe Biden’s eye that filled with blood on TV just a few weeks ago, and it was Joe Biden’s teeth that came loose during a national debate last month, and it has been Joe Biden taking it easy on the campaign trail, going on vacation, disappearing for days at a time, etc.

If Democrats are smart, they will remember the lesson of 2016 when an obviously frail, sickly, and weak Hillary Clinton collapsed into a van at that September 11 memorial event.

While I have always made fun of Bernie’s age, I have also always used him as an example of what a robust 78-year-old looks like, how it is possible to be virile and vibrant into your late seventies. In fact, I have used Bernie as an example to explain just how frail and old Joe Biden looks by comparison.

Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the idea of Trump’s second term, and Bernie’s health scare will probably serve as a reality check that will have them rethinking their support for these pushing-80 candidates. What they are imagining right now is what a catastrophe this would have been had Bernie won the general election.

Naturally, then, these thoughts are going to turn to Slow Joe and the fact that if this happened to Bernie, there is an even bigger chance it will happen to Joe, who was never as energetic or full of fire as Bernie.

This reality check could also hurt Warren, who is 70. If she wins the nomination, she will be 71 and the oldest presidential nominee (from either party) in history.

Sure, Warren seems spry and energetic but … so did Bernie.

Regardless, this has been a very bad week for Quid Pro Joe … and it is only Wednesday.

""To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,"" the former vice president said of the current White House occupant, adding: ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.""

Biden had previously indicated that he favored considering impeachment for Trump only if the administration refused to turn over documents to Congress related to the ongoing Ukraine investigation. On Tuesday night, the White House made clear they would not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment probe.

On its face then, Biden's hand was forced by the White House's decision not to cooperate at all. And that undoubtedly was a factor! But so likely did this fact: In four of the last five national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a larger share of the national primary vote than Biden. And for the first time in this race, Warren's polling average is now above Biden's -- albeit by .2 percentage points.

What those numbers mean is that Biden is really starting to feel the heat from Warren. While she has been rising in polls for months now, it's become clear of late that she isn't slowing down much, even as she approaches and passes Biden, who has been the race's frontrunner since the day he announced his candidacy."

Partial transcript as follows:

CABRERA: Senator, the president has continued to throw out more baseless allegations against Joe Biden this weekend on Twitter. The former vice-president has now taken the president – – taken on the president directly in a new Washington Post op-ed, and he writes this. Trump is frantically pushing flat out lies. The bunk conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency, but it won’t work because the American people know me, and they know him. To be clear, there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice-president, or his son Hunter Biden, even the Ukrainian prosecutor, has said as much. Senator, if the overwhelming issue for Democrats is President Trump must be defeated. Do you feel that you and other Democrats should be doing more to speak in one voice that Joe Biden’s family is off-limits?

BOOKER: No, I’ve – – I’ve said time and time again that this is unacceptable that if you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me in this case. There is no, as you said, these are baseless, unfounded, scurrilous lies plain and simple. Trying to undermine the character of one of the statesmen of our country, not our party, but our country and so yes, you’ve got a problem with me. I can’t speak for this in a political context. This is just me as an American to see these kind of attacks, and whether it’s the lies this president tells about Joe Biden or lies he tells about – – about other American citizens to demean and degrade them. Hell, I found what he wrote about Mitt – – Mitt Romney to be absolutely unacceptable, assaulting another statesperson in our nation. And so this is a president that is demeaning and degrading. He is lying and deceiving, and there’s got to be some accountability and the fatigue of this country. There’s got to come a point that people just say enough is enough.

You know, we are a nation of virtue. We’re a nation where character matters and – – and this president is – – is engaging in a level of moral vandalism that has got to offend the sensibilities of all Americans. And so, yes, I’m sorry. I – – I was taught by my parents stand up for yourself but even more noble than that you should stand up for others who are being wrongfully attacked. And I don’t care if it’s one of his fellow Republicans Mitt Romney or the character of Vice-President Joe Biden, it’s unacceptable, and he’ll have a problem with me and I will always speak out against those kind of scurrilous attacks especially from a coward who is showing the greatest type of weakness there is which is lies, deceptions and cowardness."
